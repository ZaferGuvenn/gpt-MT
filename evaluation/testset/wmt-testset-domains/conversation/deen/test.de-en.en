The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee would equal 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# a serious customer and that is why it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or a instructions what I should attach to the package so that it can be traced by you all as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago...for €249.
Now it costs €179.
That really bothers me, I must say.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way of getting the credit?
Oh yeah, I don’t have access to the WiFi password anymore.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a minute.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get back a transfer back for the price difference?
When is the deadline?
According to the law on distance selling I have a 1 month long right to return.
Since my return credit, which I never received, was no longer extended as would be fair, I would like to take my order valued at about
€#NUMBER# out of my shopping cart and just order somewhere else, where friendliness to customers is more highly valued and I don’t have to type all night in order to accomplish nothing!!
What am I supposed to do with this number??
will the full amount of the purchase price be refunded upon delivery?
A total of 5 books are on it.
4 of those work.
Only the one that I bought today doesn’t work
Apparently the stool had an unnoticed issue when it was sold.
How could damage to the upholstery just pop up like that after 9 months?
I first tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has not been functioning for about
14 days now.
That is why I have been buying the books via the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but would like to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like that you add 2 more chairs to the order and send me the bill.
We had another mail address earlier, but I changed it.
Yes, I already contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately at that point all warranty claims were turned down.
We informed ourselves about our rights and that is why we are writing you again.
We originally contacted you a half a year ago.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to order a small example of the furniture wood?
It needs to expand on furniture which is already here, so we have got to check if the color works
It is still not working, I can only see the front page but I can’t turn the page.
Hello, I would like to order something and something occurred to me after a few days, that I forgot about the last step of the payment.
Our product isn’t available anymore, unfortunately.
Do you know when it might be in stock again?
Or whether it will come back again at all?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Store credit sounds great.
Then I will certainly just use it for the new order.
Thank you for clearing this up so quickly!
If the lamp is sent out in March, how long with the delivery itself take?
I already cut my finger
This is absolutely absurd
Hello, I just saw that the Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been taken out of the inventory entirely?
Is it possible to order this Vitrine in another country?
when will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be carried to my apartment, I must cancel my order!
I get that now but can I order the lid now, which is in the shopping cart, and have it delivered to Germany?
I used the contact form to return an article, or rather to submit a return, and wanted to check up on if that had come in or was being processed since I haven’t had a confirmation yet.
Please start the cancellation process.
Then it will be legally relevant.
I took a screen shot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone Dining Table, White
Is it also available at a size of 230 cm?
I have taken apart the lamp once more.
And assembled it back together.
Unfortunately it still is not working.
That is why I would like to send it back
Could you send over the return receipt, then I can pack up the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.
We didn’t do anything with the stool.
the rip appeared all at once
I just sat down on it
This is where the lower part was damaged, that is, the part with the storage space.
Will it all be picked up again or just the storage section?
This one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, there’s an item that should have been delivered last week and which still hasn’t been delivered.
I contacted the chat line twice but haven’t heard anything.
The first lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second lady said yesterday that she would check and send an email but she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them demonstrated a defected after a relatively short amount of time (there is a hole in the material on the from side.
I ask for your support.
how long does it take to order the yellow one with, and without, armrests?
Can one also order the legs in a brighter shade?
Wonderful, that works :) do I need to provide anything else?
You only need the tracking number in my inbox?
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still is not working
Yes, it is the F parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there was a problem with one of the pieces.
The central beams are held by two feet...unfortunetly these are too small and the beams won’t attach to the feet.
What should I do now?
I can’t build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which were produced incorrectly.
The middle beam doesn’t fit into the intended mount.
Which is why I’m getting a new one.
When will it be sent out?
no they aren’t flat.
According to the assembly instructions they are the correct ones for the design, they were just too narrow
But whatever.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
Mine are not flat
Could I get ones sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem once more?
However, they don’t get back till much later
And I still need to pay the delivery costs
Good day!
Unfortunately, the lid is sold out in Germany.
Can I order with you and pay in euro?
It is about the #PRS_ORG# bedspread in blue-green.
I hope that you also have a beautiful day and that you stay healthy ♡
I am not able to mount the tabletop onto the frame.
We’re talking about a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of this.
We want one of the tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
instead we got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t even slide them into each other to make it more compact.
Could you help me with that?
Otherwise I need to send it back because it won’t do the job I need.
I would really appreciate a response
yes that is much simpler!
Then we will do it that way!
will you be sending me the return receipt per mail?
the patch has now been concluded.
I already checked on this before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
So little credit credit, are you shameless?
We don’t agree with this.
Return with the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back into my account?
Yes, we have done both again and are using Version 4.5...
it could be that you have already heard about the problem many times
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on there.
As soon as I try to open it a note pops up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file is most likely corrupted, please submit a report to customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Could you help me further?
Chat connection down so what now?
I also need to work now and again.
I can only open the book for a short amount of time, as soon as I look at something else, then I am no longer able to read the book and must sign out and sign back in and load the book up once more and search for my spot in it up to the point I have read to.
I already was in contact with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this via email?
For all 3 packets as well?
The lamp did come in 3 individual packets after all
ok well thanks anyway!
then I will just shop somewhere else as soon as the money is in.
Will I get that back without issue?
Could you send me the three variations via email and let me know how I would best reach them
It’s all good.
We won’t order anything from you anymore.
When you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you will see that you obviously lost a good client.
You can forward that on to your manager.
It doesn’t make good business sense.
Yesterday your colleague said to me that the return payment had been arranged and now you say that I first have to send the thing back.
I can’t do anything about the fact that the cabinet was sent to me totally destroyed
Please look at what your colleague had written in the screen shot
It says there loud and clear that a return payment had been arranged and I have still not received a return payment per #PRS_ORG#
You can let your manager know that you’ve now lost two of your best clients.
My boyfriend ordered a variety of furniture for our apartment via his account.
We are not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared after only a few months.
A desk chair has to be able to handle normal usage.
Otherwise it can’t be sold as a desk chair.
In any case, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, I’m not able to procure another kind of packaging.
I am going to take apart the cabinet, so that they can be made readily available for the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional, purchasable stools, however, we can’t seem to find these in your selection.
Could you help out?
I am a real good client of yours and have already filled 2 apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to ask about the best price for the gray Odelle leather sofa.
The delivery time was delayed once again, is it a good estimate now?
Thank you
Best regards
Is there a telephone number because a chat that makes you wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
The que hasn’t changed at all unfortunately...I am going to give up now, because it simply just isn’t working here.
Hello
I’ll check that.
I will speak to the bank and get back to you
thank you for your support
why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original €1699?
I already was really upset with you back then #NUMBER# as I ordered the #PRS_ORG# cabinet.
I sent out the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I have not received a confirmation email or anything like that.
My question reads, has my request been received.
Not everyone has time for your stupid chat and your phony cheap-ware from China.
Your mistake for you to rectify and not push onto our budget.
Contact Ms #NAME#.
I cannot be chatting with you everyday
We talked yesterday and agreed that I, or rather Ms. #NAME#, received an email with 60 euros of store credit, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# night stand and a return receipt.
This email has not arrived yet.
The packet would still like to be brought to #PRS_ORG#.
Please contact me
Kind regards
ok everything is saying authorized, how can I check more in depth?
yes both email addresses
#PRS_ORG# I will do it, very nice and friendly service, it took awhile though, until someone came, they were super
Howdy there the #PRS_ORG# team,
I just contacted y’all using customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yeah, but it means before.
They can’t deliver out of England because of #PRS_ORG#.
And what about the store credit??
Otherwise you’ve lost a client?!
In any case, I received a defective delivery but still payed the full price.
Then, I will just have to rate you all accordingly!
A table top for 8 people was delivered instead of one for 6.
The frame is still for 6 people though.
i already had the lid in the shopping cart and could buy them now!!!
What should I do?
But I haven’t even received it and was thus unable to figure it out, which is why I ended up asking about it.
I had bigger problems las year because of Corona and didn’t have any time for it.
And now the expiration seems to have run out, which really makes me mad.
Take a look at the chat, it’s about the Asare bench.
I would like to give it back and then order it once again since it has just gone down in price :)
Why is the delivery only to be sent out on 03/16?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, it is only when I click on it does an extra window come up with the notice
It was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is it a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered package.
But we would still like the cabinet model in spite of this, just a new undamaged one
And not just cancel the whole order.
I received my order today, but unfortunately it is a totally different color, and besides, the surface is scratched and the table leg has an indent on it.
The first order had a color exactly like the website!
We are very disappointed!!!!
What could you offer me?
If we exchange the table now do we get a totally new color or something like that?
The cancelation email was sent out on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Two times, by the way.
They were never confirmed.
Can it not be changed or something? Feel free to write in English, I understand that rather well
That is already very long, which means I must desist
It’s alright, thanks.
I’m expecting an expedient response with the latest being the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Apart from that, we are “Star Customers” with you and have already bought many articles
So why are you asking me for 20 euros?
Hi, I was writing a colleague of yours yesterday, but I haven’t received a response.
It’s about my wardrobe which came yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn’t fit into the wardrobe.
I ask you to get back to me asap.
The wardrobe cannot be used in this state.
I am asking for a return call, because the wooden table was delivered to me defect.
Broken body through an uncareful delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
I would like the #PRS_ORG# delivery to be carried into the room itself.
How can I arrange this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# stool.
I don’t know how tall the seat is...
Unfortunately I’m still waiting for an email from your support team.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the order of the hiring
contact initiation on the side of the moving company in order to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I have received no messages up to this point.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support worker, none of whom promised more than that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It’s about a return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It remains to be seen when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping it the way it is isn’t an option for me.
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
I wish you a good evening
Hello, my delivery no. is #NUMBER#; when will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 01/12/21.
A totally different lamp from the one I ordered was delivered
Please call
If you are able to extend the store credit for me, then I will put out a larger order immediately, but in any case I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and have not sent it back.
And the fact that the past year proceeded differently than expected, I wasn’t able to predict it and then didn’t promptly clarify the issue.
But I have taken the damages as the client and I am not going to just accept that.
Well, I would like to send the lamp back
How do I go about that best?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# is very beautiful, however, I can’t tell how high the seat is.
Could you help me further?
I am not able to carry out any more purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
It works to purchase the #PRS_ORG# via the computer.
My bank details are all up to date.
What could be the problem?
But the chair is broken!
The €20 are not going to help either.
These are the legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that you at least take bake the broken chair.
That is not only your legal responsibility but also standard practice in eCommerce.
Please check once again to see if you could at least take back the broken chair.
We would then just sell the second chair privately.
We will already be losing quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered yet.
I’ll ask again.
In the order and on the receipt it said that the article would be delivered into a room of my choice.
The delivery service is #NAME#.
I am now calling them.
I was told that they deliver just to the building’s entrance because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is this true?
If so, then I need to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who could carry heavy furniture up to the second floor for me.
will I not be called?
I submitted a query
How’s it going now?
What is going on with the books, or rather, how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not very good, but I can manage
It concerns the return payment of €#NUMBER#
I was told through email on the 18/01 that the return payment had been carried out successfully.
However, the money has still not been deposited on my end.
Could you please check this.
Did this look like this for others.
Is there a way to send back the lamp?
Because it hangs to low for a dinning table?
That is why I would be happy to send it back.
Could you help me with that?
And the commode?
Are we going to get an update in the following weeks about an exact delivery time?
Hello, have you already sat down on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
In case that doesn’t work, I would also be content with a rebate or store credit.
If need be I can find someone to pick-up the furniture.
Over 1,000 Euro for goods that I don’t need is really rather much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to have known, if the screws were supposed to be part of the delivery.
I would really like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) onto the intended hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait time really wasn’t worth it
Do you not prioritize premium customers?
I understand.
Since the delivery took place only at the beginning of March, it might be possible up till that point.
I need to print this off, tape it onto the package and drop it off with the post, is that it?
I don’t need to click on anything or fill anything else out?
That is exactly what I would like to avoid; that is why I am writing you.
I would like a refund equaling the original cost.
A 8 euro return delivery fee is an insult in my eyes.
I also ordered a lamp shade with you, which is still being delivered.
Now I can see, that the item is too big/bulky and not made for my tastes.
That is why I ordered another draping piece.
I put it together and that is when I noticed this - grasping the white foam.
I’m real sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will get a full refund.
This is also rather sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# available in larger sizes, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to guarantee that the damaged cabinet can be picked-up soon.
I’m asking you to please arrange that asap.
I don’t have suitable packaging material for this, but I’ll take the cabinet apart as much as I can before the pick-up - you and #PRS_ORG# need to figure out how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me via telephone if they want to set up a pick-up time.
Are there directions for assembly?
How long would I have to take care of that, or rather, to decide on the return?
This certainly is not an exception according to Section 312d of the BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from legal obligations when distance selling.
I was not on the referenced date when #PRS_ORG# picked up at the pickup site.
Because I was gone at a funeral, this was not able to happen.
Could you please send me an alternative pick-up date.
I am continuously available again to meet after 01.02#NUMBER#.
I bought a book, which I could only read up to 10% of and then the problems started.
I am not allowed to open the book.
Following your recommendation, I synchronized, removed and downloaded the app once more but NOTHING worked.
I am somewhat frustrated, because the whole ordeal cost me a lot of time so I’m hoping for assistance.
Alright, that works.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection from #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I set a date during the order process?
Yeah, that’s what I don’t get, I also ordered the other goods from the German site.
Why should they be coming from England?
When I ordered, they weren’t sold out.
I ordered as far back as November.
But it had been confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It’s still about my order that couldn’t be delivered.
I was chatting using the name #NAME#.
On the other hand, one should be able to deliver the  #PRS_ORG# goods for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany under the table, otherwise is there somewhere these goods could be picked up in Germany.
I only view you as my partner company.
but up on the border of the wooden part there are two deep notches, which have been filled in with some yellow substance
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
So you have already received the sofa?
We never got a confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do you mean with please return!
When I have downloaded a book from #PRS_ORG#, the report came in that your #PRS_ORG# didn’t authorize this book
any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me whether or not I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
I’m sorry but the chair was being sold as a office chair.
How can a desk chair go broke after 9 months?
The warranty claim in Germany is 24 months.
This is really a bad service.
Hello, I sent out an email on Monday in order to let you know, that my order came damaged and I attached photos.
Have you seen the email?
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I never received a message
Whatever, now I still have a sofa without any use for it.
Could you at least send me a rebate or store credit?
Which would cost more?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, whether I can pay in euro and have the lid delivered to me in Germany
Can you look into that?
Right, I get it.
Great, well thanks again that it went so smoothly!
I have been getting this error report for the last 3 weeks every time that I try to download the book, this although my bank and contact details are all up-to-date:
Please help in clearing up this error, because I
would in that case like to buy another e-Book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return ticket for my order #NUMBER# both last week and this morning.
I was told that one had been sent to me.
Because I haven’t received anything (not even in the spam folder), I wanted to ask once more, how long this normally takes.
Thank you very much.
Which is that?
No matter where I click, I am redirected to your site.
I already did that a number of times, it didn’t work.
It’s a shame, I would have really liked to order with you, but when you won’t apply the store credit, then I won’t order anymore out of principle.
If you decide to change it somehow, just let me know.
Otherwise, today is the last contact.
Then just send me the number for the sideboard.
It’s not as if any hardware store is open during lockdown...
I already wrote everything to your colleague, Semina, I believe,
and now I have lost the record of the conversation and I don’t know, if an answer was provided to my concerns.
I have had to work in the meantime and was on the telephone and then everything was suddenly gone...
what is there to check, if there was any money there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe something was entered in wrong
but are there usually large sizes
because it is available in large for black
It doesn’t really help that I have been waiting for it since September.
Now it isn’t working at all.
My account seems to have been locked and the language is now English
What store credit???
I didn’t get any store credit validated when I made my last order!
Unfortunately I can’t make it back into my customer account.
Could you send me the receipt from the order number #NUMBER# once more to the mail address given above?
Can the packaging material be disposed of properly?
We have ways of keeping it for so long.
We would be using the table as our own, as was advertised by you
happily, i already ordered the same blue armchair in november and had it delivered. i would have then ordered one in grey because they are so beautiful
Does the cabinet need to be taken apart completely for pick-up and reimbursement?
And when would the pick-up be?
Good morning,
my order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only been a partial delivery.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note “delivery not possible”.
All the three other packets have arrived so I know that delivery is definitely possible.
Could you let me know how things should move forward?
Have a great start to your week!
You can forget about that, I already explained that multiple times yesterday!!
This is a cabinet made of glass and all sides are broken, glass is lying everywhere and the container is broken
The cabinet sits in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is delaying coming to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
That means that the cabinet cannot be picked up, because no one is allowed to enter my home
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of the stool was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it’s that way for all books, that is the reason for the request to #PRS_ORG#, because it concerns a more general problem
I would really like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG#, in any case, my main priority is to carry out the return as quickly as possible.
I just ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there was a problem with the frame, which yellow filler materiel tried to conceal.
It doesn’t look good.
I would really like to return the mirror and I have already put it back in the package and tapped it up.
How do I continue with the return process?
That is a shame, I was given them as a present but they are too small :(
I just got an email that the package would be coming back to you because of a mistake on my end.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# in order to divert it, but there’s no way that is working.
Can it directly be resent to me or do I have to wait for the money to be transferred back to me and then renew the order once more?
It would mean, sadly, that I would not order again, because it has already taken such a very long time.
Have you already sat down on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
please send me some kind of transaction number..or anything, which could help me
Wire transfer confirmation, etc.
i would like to give away a store credit code
just like how #PRS_ORG# does gift vouchers
does that work for you?
I have not been able to buy books for the last 2 weeks.
After I confirm there is always the following error notification: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have read the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it with the PC, synchronized it and patched it.
Nothing helped.
yes we have deleted all books everything has been newly authorized and new books have been downloaded
Am I going to get a mail confirmation?
I have already been assured 3 times by your collegues...how reliable is your information?
When will the moving company be getting in contact with me?
I already wrote you, did you not receive my text?
Can I already place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
