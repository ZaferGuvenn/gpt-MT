I also think that as a general rule, children should not be expected to overtake a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to care for the younger ones to some degree.
Sometimes check-up on them, sometimes help, sometimes get the bottle, etc.
They learn responsibility this way, help within the family and are thus connected with it.
As long as they can continue to be a kid themselves, I don’t see the problem.
If your first child looks after themselves alone for a short amount of time, that is OK, that is actually good.
You can best get a sense of whether or not this works for your children.
It is not as if they should change the second child’s diaper and sit for hours by them as they fall asleep.
It is probably questionable from a strictly legal perspective.
Maybe the psychologist would also have something to say about it.
Since if something actually does happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for child 1 to take care of child 2.
If that is a risk that you would like to take that is up to you, of course ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a myster/thriller a few years back and I can basically still remember the entire plot, but the title escapes me, maybe someone here knows differently...
The story is about fear and treating fear.
At the beginning of the story, a veterinarian commits suicide by covering himself in feed and going into the cage of a carnivorous cat.
The case is taken up by a commissioner, who after a short investigation goes to his therapist who runs a clinic for patients with phobias.
The commissioner has a young niece, who also as a phobia (of fire) and who is also with this therapist.
More suicides take place and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of the suicide and to document it and post these photos on the internet.
At any rate, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy, where the patients are implanted with a chip, which suppresses the fear center of the brain and in the end the patients face their fears in the most extreme ways.
(a woman jumps out of a window, another one drives herself to death on purpose)
Facing fear this way is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there is a great showdown in the clinic, which involves a fire.
That is the plot in broad strokes, I am positive that the book was originally written by a French author.
In case this story rings a bell for anyone, or if you could even tell me the name of the book, I would be so happy.
Child, four-years-old, splinter under the thumbnail
A child of four has gotten an entire wooden splinter under their thumbnail (on the outside).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn’t work and caused pain.
Now the child is hysterical whenever we try.
No way this is working.
Tomorrow, it’s to the doctor.
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent out an application.
Today an invitation for an interview came in the mail.
I would like to respond to the email.
Unfortunately the name isn’t “Peter” but a more complicated name.
I tried to google it and according to what their cultural background is, they could be either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how I am supposed to write the email.
Can someone help me with it?
**I am a foreigner and don’t want to step on the toes of some clerk.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
[CW] The feeling when I can’t help.
Content Warning: I will describe domestic violence here in some detail.
I just really need to write something straight from the soul.
I (21) often come in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence because of my job.
Something that has really been bothering me, and which really comes up too often, is that many victims don’t let themselves find help and think that we cannot help them.
It is clear to me that we can’t do everything and that we are not perfect.
However, there are few things in my line of work that bother me more than when I am not able to do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even during private conversations far away from the eyes and ears of the perpetrator I am not able to make progress.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of retribution, fear of leaving the social environment you are used to, fear to rip children from this environment.
What I would like to make clear for everyone, partially on the verge of tears myself, is that everyone deserves to live life without violence.
I would like for all women know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish that I would be able to help out in this case...I know that I can’t.
It doesn’t make it any easier though.
Please think about the fact that you are worth more than living with violence, that is so important.
He has moved to a company that he used to complain about.
That doesn’t make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink some tea.
It was a year ago.
He obviously was not nailed down into his old position and decided to search somewhere else.
You are able to do that.
The fact that he didn’t like it back then: whatever.
He didn’t find his other job good either.
There are too many variables.
Help with my very first campaign
Boron here!
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure “Over the Greifenpass” and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into one of my own campaigns written just for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The large strokes are complete, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought through and now I am working on writing the initial adventure, but I am already stumbling over myself in the first encounter.
The premise is that the hero should bring a cart with grain from Gratenfels into a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the plot should develop further.
A group of goblins should waylay the heroes a few miles away from the village and lock them into an ambush.
I would like to give the playable characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in a number of ways: They can persuade, trade, pressure, recognize the danger quickly, whatever occurs to the players.
Strength of group: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they are not noticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a narrow pass, three of them on both the left and the right side flanking the cart, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it should come to a fight and the heroes are defeated, then there are two possible outcomes
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are finally found and healed by the son of Dorfschulzen, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeated proves inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his squires and comes to help the heroes.
The cart is still there, everything’s great.
How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina in solution 2?
Is this too much for an initial encounter in Abenteuer?
The group of goblins will play a decisive roll later, they are not just there as cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect to have so many answers, especially with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas to heart and now have more trust in my narrative.
I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post.
First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1.
It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!).
Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here.
It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end.
In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident.
In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn’t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed.
Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton.
The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster.
It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules.
In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste.
But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion.
Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher.
This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously.
Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters.
You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages.
The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1.
In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements.
At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be really interested in your opinion.
Someone who works in bio chemistry or studied bio chemistry
I am now studying bio chemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject itself rather exciting and standing around in a laboratory doesn’t bother me (I’ve already got the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Naturally, I informed myself about carrier outlooks before I began the study program and thought at the time and actually still do think that I do want to get a PhD and that I will get one.
At the moment, however, there are some doubts, especially as far as carrier choices are concerned.
On the one hand you always hear (Studycheck, etc.) about really great carrier chances and that the profession is really in demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and really poorly paid positions.
And that is why I would be really interested to know:
1) What are you working as right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/pay?
3) What did you study/Which vocational training did you receive?
4) Would you do the whole thing all over again?
Thank you very much for your answer!
I am unsure at the moment and am considering to possibly brake off the study program in 2022 and do vocational training as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience there, just write me :)
Extra stress from vacations and holiday weekends
This was a topic for me last week.
But I now need to use my long weekend in order to relax.
But first I’ll post about it.
At the office, there is not just stress from large holidays, like Christmas.
There appears to also be stress around days off and “bridging days”.
That was really the case: Last week was Assumption Day, which we call “Ascension Day” in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses have an extra day off before the weekend on Friday, a so-called “bridge day”, which is semi official.
That is, I was home for a long 4 day weekend last week.
What was up last week?
Constant stress.
Tons of emails, which certainly had to go out before Ascension Day, an order here, an order there, everything *must* be done before the long weekend.
Well because...?
Because “not till next week” sounds like so much time and that isn’t allowed?
Because the people in all honesty want to accomplish as much in a short week as they do in a normal one?
I wasn’t just stressed on Wednesday, but I was royally annoyed.
What’s up with this self-flagellation from the holiday?
Why do we have days off then, if we are not able to really enjoy them?!
The stress was not coming from up top, mind you, the coworkers were all doing it themselves of course.
My question is simple: Are the Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed Evangelical manner?
Or do you also do this in the north as well?
Fertility treatment with private insurance / What is an “insurance case”?
Hello everyone,
we have been undergoing fertility treatment for some time but now that it’s time to send invoices to the private health insurance, it’s getting a bit complicated.
How it happened:
We applied in advance for the fertility treatments with the private insurer and got approval for three attempts.
The attempts where not limited in any way (by time restraints, success requirements, etc.).
The first attempt lead directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the private insurer.
Awhile later we attempted to have a second child, and then had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but still haven’t billed these to the private insurance.
We are now reapplying for cost-sharing with the private insurance and were approved for three more attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have tried more often than we applied for, but we only charge the most expensive ones to the insurance, of course) we turned in the invoices to the insurance company and received a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the private insurance will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: After the first pregenancy/birth, the leftover 2 attempts from the first approval were not carried over.
The desire for a second child was then a whole new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, “An insurance case begins with the healing treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.”
The question for the resident experts is:
* Who is right here, the insurance company (only 3 attempts would be reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the private insurance have warned us in the approval that all further attempts would not carry over after a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) was certainly not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion on this.
Thank you for your help in advance!
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films
There is no general definition or an exact budget limit that defines a low-budget film.
Wikipedia says the following:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, like on letterboxd.com, for example.
Do you know any interesting items in this category?
What excites you about it?
And maybe, what do you generally not like?
Sorry, just because he says he isn’t an antisemite doesn’t mean that he isn’t one.
That is like when a member of the AFD say they have nothing against foreigners.
I wouldn’t let either of them off so easy.
The thing is, Kollegah is always reproducing whatever antisemitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just give it up entirely.
Yeah, wow, then maybe you shouldn’t be taken seriously just like Kollegah.
Who fundamentally questions the existence of evolution is entirely lost.
In my opinion, God just got the whole thing running.
But as soon as you’re a creationist, then you have to start believing that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just pushing nonsense.
And then you become an enemy of science and shouldn’t be taken seriously just like Kollegah
We don’t have to carry out any discussions here about the better dish, but there are certainly similarities between them.
They are both made with meat that has been grilled on a rotating skewer.
And that is where they both get their name.
An equivalent in English would be something like “rotary”, which doesn’t really sound delicious to me.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo Dlan/Magic
We got a new fiber optic cable connected to the house a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi connection.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out a smooth 50 Mbit with just a few exceptions.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also comes to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
Having said this, the full 500 is not received by the other DLan module, which is sending out the WiFi, but rather the more I move away from the module within the house, the less it receives (using an outlet, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
That means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the second floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I ordered a new Devolo Magic set as well, which is supposed to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but it still lead to similar, significant losses.
Can someone please explain to me how so much internet speed is “going lost” through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time consuming to also lay LAN cables all over the house.
I am really at a loss here, which is why I have created an extra account here.
That is why I would be so happy about getting an answer.
Only today, only this week left, only up until XY...
Dear gals, girls and women,
I have something which I would just like to write and maybe it is also this way for someone else out there...
I am 24-years-old, have PTSD, am a full-time student and a dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn’t cry or go to kindergarten is it for all intents and purposes my child.
My boyfriend (6 years together) is sick and got second degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but he is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see him and touch him, we cuddled a lot and it was very nice.
I helped him to shower (because his hand is in bandages from the burn).
On top of that he also has a cold and we see each other less (1-2 per week), which really does a number on me given my need for affection and love.
My dog child has stomach pain right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying cuddled up in the blanket and has clamed down a bit now that I have been there for him with the heat lamp and the petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she has now been gone for a month.
Now there is also quite a bit of house work for us, which we are dividing up, of course.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is in a good place right now, I’m halfway through treatment and come to terms with it alright.
Not great, but I am dealing with it and am free of symptoms.
The university is asking a lot right now (by my standards), tomorrow at 3 PM I have a written test that I haven’t prepared for at all and the day after I have an hour of anatomy, for which I do need to prepare a little.
And next week I even have an oral text on that Tuesday, and what comes after that is still there in my calendar and not in my head because there isn’t any room left in there.
Here is my week: Just till the day after tomorrow, and then the weekend.
But then after that the whole thing continues?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And that is how it continues forever.
I believe I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental reference points, because otherwise I won't be able to cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and “chaotic”, but I am not going to manage this any other way...
The same for you?
In all honesty I am eternally grateful that I don’t have to work.
Really, truly grateful, I can’t put that into words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my PTSD any other way.
I believe that is in part due to the mental load on women and that is why I thought to myself that I was sure to find some comrades in suffering here...
I wish all of you a relaxing evening the week is almost over!
Just something completely new: I determined at school back then that many religion teachers didn’t believe in God and it was just a subject to them like math or geography.
For me that was always strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always just seemed to believe.
What are your thoughts?
Maybe you can also talk about work and school colleagues who have different opinions.
I do understand on a deep level the difference between private life and work life and it makes sense to divide the two.
There is also a teaching plan, etc.
But I would find it quite strange to have a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What would make you want to teach religion, if you don’t believe yourself?
Like to preserve culture?
I hope that the question is not too private.
Please help find a movie
Dear people,
I am searching for a film from my childhood (I’m 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
There is the present (real world).
Then there is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can’t describe it better anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead there is a young soldier (uniform is similar to the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and a plot is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring this woman into that world in order to be able to live himself.
The portal is also the burial place of the soldier, I believe.
In the end, the two soldiers fight against each other.
In case this rings a bell for any of you, I would appreciate an answer.
Our child would only sleep on its stomach from day 1.
Fast forward: still kicking :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Take care that everything around it is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check a few times, but don’t do constant surveillance.
That will make you go crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
That’s right, ours didn’t have a sleeping bag but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when they sleep.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up somewhat from its belly?
Or is it lying with its face directly into the mattress?
You can tell from that if everything is in order.
We have all grown up already and as my husband came into the world, it was very normal that children would sleep on their belly.
In order to say it very clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not every promise can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just obvious that the politics of this broadcaster has really gone to the dogs in the meantime.
Almost every program is sponsored (ok), but they still go on begging tours at the same time.
It was said that you were an “independent” internet broadcaster.
Arno quote: You don’t want to be “a walking advertisement”.
What are you now?
A 8:15 AM advertisement who attempts to bring their cheap merch to elite fans.
And then we have Marah’s Do’s & Don’ts.
That apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne, of course.
They are still able to insult people, of course.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to burn everything down at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is anyone impressed by all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) is no longer charging through my power supply.
I bought this part new just 5 months ago, which means it should probably still work.
I thought an adaptor was enough for operation anyway.
Error notices, the battery is dead and the laptop is not starting in spite of the connected adaptor.
Because of this, I even removed the battery, but that didn’t help.
Maybe you have an idea?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can’t I just use the laptop with the power cable?
Is something else broken?
Thanks for your help!
“Why Kids are not Tyrants” Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW: psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up today in my Twitter feed and I started watching immediately.
>The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a much-loved guest by talk shows and has held discussions all over Europe.
He launched a serious debate over raising children with his book “Why our Children become Tyrants” (2008).
Past patients, parents and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film can be hard to watch.
I am very grateful that people are now thinking and acting differently than they used to.
Parents and other responsible parties should never, ever struggle for power over the child.
Our goal should be to give our children enough space to develop on their own and to make boundaries for the child as spacious as possible and reasonable for the situation.
Geez, I’m still shaken up about it.
What you are describing is called *Awareness* and refers to the sensory perception under full narcoses.
This occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often it results in the hearing of voices/noises, less common is the appearance of images and the least common is the perception of pains.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations which lead to a high rate of Awareness, which is avoided for the protection of the baby up until the cutting of the umbilical cord.
Preceding episodes of Awareness should be brought up in the consultation prior to the narcosis.
Certain anesthetic procedures like total interveinal anesthesia (TIVA) come along with a slightly higher risk.
**EDIT: Dear reader, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex** doesn’t have any by definition.
I read your comment wrong.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
A few weeks ago, I received a lot of great tips here for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and tender!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I would like to make roulades for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow, I will start a beef stock for this.
Do any of you have additional tips for me?
Notice: I don’t have an oven, just a large pot.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag, greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE from the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is this post about?
If you look at the MBundestag’s actions over the past few months you can really see that: It’s not really there.
We have come into winter hibernation and extended the summer slump a few months.
#What is the problem?
And what was it really about?
For the most part that can hang in connection with feelings of discontent, like how somethings here expired and how we are in general.
The last days have contributed to the impression that a lot of people here really are interested in MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundestag was asked, who would like to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who was made aware of this project in the last few days and who found a pile of shards, putting it simply.
After some push and pull, many people in the community gathered together with a desire to bring this project back to life.
Having said this, I would like to expressly call upon everyone to take part once again; it is the only way this project can survive into the future.
For this purpose, we created a discussion platform in the forum of a Discord server, in which we can all exchange opinions with each other as well as working out concrete things.
The server can be entered with the following link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing ordinances must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside in the future?
* How should new members be enlisted?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten a few things, which is not a bad thing, that is why we have Discord after all.
If you would like to, and have the time, then come onto Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a discussion with a colleague who I really like.
She lived as a vegetarian for quite a while and even now only very rarely eats meat.
I was also vegetarian for a few years myself.
On the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned middle step, I answered quickly, honestly and without much thought.
The reason: I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood, that I was still supporting cruelty to animals.
Which is why I decided to become vegan.
That is when I had the impression that I caused her displeasure, she defended vegetarianism and added that she knows where her meat comes from and as a vegetarian you do reduce the pain of animals.
Now I am wondering if my answer was too “clumsy”?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that I am quickly put into a corner as a vegan person and that conflicts appear even if you wouldn’t have wanted it that way.
Signing off, a harmony loving vegan (;
Thank you first of all for bringing this all up here, for my part I spent a decade in public service doing a similar job, we were even weapon carriers with executive power, I don’t have to go any more in depth than that!
I always find the question about right or left to be solved rather easily.
As a general rule, you should say that public servants should rather come somewhere in the spectrum from liberals to conservatives and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course people who wear uniforms and carry weapons are magically pulled right of conservative should also be clear to everyone, that these people are of course having issues coming to terms with reality, that is clear to see, because apart from your average whites you also have many people in the meantime coming with immigrant background of course, women and also homosexuals (and I don’t now mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because these are becoming rarer in the executive branch, if they are there at all, but normal men and women who you don’t even notice it when you talk to them) and even for these people I can and must just let go, because in doubt they will save your life or go out on a limb for you.
But these periphery groups also represent a rather conservative position, even if it sounds strange at first, in my opinion, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if these politics supposedly stand up for them or think they have to do right by them, while they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right: because police and armed forces are just a cross section of society, this means that you will find extreme right people there, but that these people are permitted to openly speak their minds in that space or even form whatever plans to endanger society is totally exaggerated and really bothers me.
Of course it happens that police and soldiers who were often out of the country on deployment often begin to generalize because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are contrary to political correctness.
It also happens that they sometimes find real kindred spirits and engage in excited exchanges of thoughts.
Nevertheless, this sort of thing should be pushed against and all of it should be counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so involved internationally, which is a good thing in my opinion, which is why we can’t allow for real racists and Nazis to be among our ranks!
More tidy with a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with an issue for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (freelancer, not a lot of free time), but somehow this whole time I have found it more difficult than it should be to keep a clean and tidy home on some kind of regular basis.
There are always times when things are just lying around, and then at some point it starts to bother me and I make it all tidy and clean.
But it is very rarely the case that “someone comes to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not much better, it does bother me sometimes but most of the time house chores lose in favor of work and laziness.
The kitchen is the most regularly clean space because we really like to cook.
Now my question: did you manage to become more tidy with a child?
We still don’t have any but we are working on it and these questions has been bugging me for some time.
Because at the moment there is no incentive for me, it just doesn’t really bother me as long as no one comes to visit or, for example, as long as there are clean clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more incentive with a child or do you still stay so sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
A carrier in social work - as someone with an avoidant personality disorder?
I have been trained in the field of software development and have been done with my training for about a year.
The problem is that I now notice more and more that this isn’t really the carrier for me, which is why for a long time I have been contemplating starting new again and studying social work.
The problem is that I have an avoidant (or anxiously insecure) personality disorder (AvPD).
That means in general terms that I have no feeling of personal value and am really shy because of it.
I have no problem speaking to people in an objective, factual manner but it is really hard for me to carry out relaxed conversations and I have been told on many occasions that I seem unapproachable (although I do think this has gotten better in the meantime).
Can a person like me be a social worker?
I don’t want to work out in the streets or at teenager meet-ups, but rather something like addiction consultation or family support.
However, I am not sure if the actual everyday work rhythm is really like how I picture it and it is really hard to find anything about this on the internet.
AvPD is already causing problems at my workplace (for me, emotionally), because I put myself down every time there is something to criticize about my code (“messed up something simple again so soon”) and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help (“I should really know how this works by now”/”I am stopping him from working with my dumb questions”/”They must think I’m really incapable,” etc).
I would probably have problems with any carrier but I didn’t want it to go unmentioned.
Statement from a community colleague in contrast to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following issue.
A walnut tree is planned to be cut down on our land.
A felling application has been sent to the community.
A colleague wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, which then would include the walnut tree, is not part of the bylaws.
Walnut trees are not specifically listed in the bylaws, however.
Can I still trust the statement of my colleague or not?
On the one hand, I really must rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the bylaws are pretty clear.
Thank you for your answer
Advice and ideas for a further carrier
First of all, happy Christmas to all of you!
Unfortunately my Christmas was only OK because my poor brain overthinks everything that you can overthink.
Before I let it all out here, I’ll say in brief: I need advice and it would be best coming from people who are somehow familiar with my situation - that is, from you.
I have ended up rather surprisingly as a student teacher.
Originally I had studied something else and even worked in the field (in order to remain somewhat anonymous I am not going to say anymore here).
The whole thing was just too boring for me and I looked for alternatives which would have been more fun for me.
Somehow I ended up going into teaching and was sure that this was it, even if the environment was much less flexible than in my previous job, I didn’t really care.
I am now for the third time like “I’ll search for other job vacancies”.
And it has just been a half of a year.
The times before I always decided to continue and to just bring the student teaching to an end, after that I can always change my mind.
But now I am totally dead.
I have had so little free time in the last months, and I am so tired of it.
It is the break, but even now there is still a mountain of work waiting for me.
I always thought before the student teaching that I was stress resistant, but back then my weekends were my weekends and after work was after work.
I really had freedom.
And the stress of work didn’t really matter in that moment.
Now even vacation with my family is stressful.
And there are these stubborn structures, which annoy me all the more.
In general, it is fun and from an outside perspective the student teaching is going well as far as feedback goes.
But I am really just spent and ask myself, how much stress my body can really handle before it just gives up entirely - if it has not done that already.
I ask myself, if I could have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read many of the posts from you all - or if I would be better off just going back to my old industry, where I was valued more, could take more free time when I needed it, and although the work was rather boring, it was paid well in return for this and really worked together towards something in a team and not a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
That is when I ask myself, if I would not just come back to the same place after a year and be as unsatisfied as I am now.
You all must have noticed that it is somehow confusing, but maybe you have an outsider’s advice or ideas of how I could get out of this situation, with which I am totally done and which makes me practically brake out in tears when I think about it for a moment.
Making decisions is something that I am not ready for emotionally, which is probably not leading to anything good.
But maybe your perspectives could help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that would be a start.
Thank you for reading and please excuse the complaining tone.
I hope that my situation has become somewhat clearer at least.
Pill problems
Dear womenfolk,
I hope I do everything right here, this is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
My problem: About five years ago I started to take the pill again out of necessity, mostly because I would have such incredible pain during my period and terrible PMS beforehand.
I would like to stop with all of that, because I already have to take so much medication to deal with chronic illnesses, which I don’t really have much say in.
My main problem, surprisingly enough, is not the pain but my skin.
During my last about two year break I went from 0 to 100 pimples everywhere on my body; it was quite the explosion.
It may sound shallow but this really was a weight on me and I didn’t feel well.
This situation never really normalized over the whole two years.
Maybe someone here has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics routine is already fragrance-free and without much fuss, but maybe there is something that someone could recommend me.
The gynecologist didn’t really take me seriously and the GP appointment is still to come.
Thank you to everyone who read through the novel!
Yes, dear sweet skin is really something.
I had pretty bad neurodermatitis before puberty, and then a period of peace, which was followed by lichen ruber and then the whole acne thing.
I have even tried all matter of diets during the course of my chronic illness and have stuck with a sugar, milk and meat-poor mix, because nothing else has really worked for me.
It could be the case that it is really just a hormone problem, but if you just have constant construction sites all over your whole body then maybe you just stop searching for cures which always seems to fail anyway.
Ref: Planning classes (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been doing a teaching internship since summer and teaching is a lot of fun for me but I am still having trouble planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped when it comes to technology, which means I really just have the board, the textbook and an overhead projector at my disposal.
At the school I can only copy b/w for free (which is frustrating for geography).
I just now require a lot of time to actually plan my teaching periods.
We are now discussing geological factors, for example, which means that every class is its own individual thing.
In principal, the methods do repeat themselves quite a bit, but on the other hand I would not like to invest way too much time just for lecturing (I need this for observing other classes, etc.).
I’m actually pretty good at sticking to the learning objective while I plan (that which I want to achieve) and then considering how I can build on top of this (for the most part I assemble a worksheet with texts from books that my students don’t have).
We have the book Terra, but I am generally not very satisfied with the assignments in the book.
Which is the reason for the worksheets.
Maybe there is a geography teacher who can help me be more time-efficient with the book.
It would really help me.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
Within the context of Reddit Advent calendars we started on Nicholas Day and that was then an occasion to start discussing family traditions leading up to Christmas, Advent, Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas break.
How was that like in the past at your house?
How was it with your partner?
Would you like to pass on these traditions to your children?
What is the best part for the children?
Boots for St. Nicholas?
Backing cookies?
Tree decoration?
Playing music?
Do the presents come from Santa Claus, the Christ Child or from grandma and grandpa?
However you do it, everyone is engaged and puts energy into Christmas in order to make it as nice as possible for the family.
Whether these are traditions set in stone or whether it is a different thing every year: let us know how it goes in your family!
The subject says everything, I am a vaccination doctor for mobile vaccination teams that only use (up to this point) the BionTech/Pfizer vaccine, mostly in nursing homes.
Because these have been covered for the most part now, the my future is mostly in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions (without a time limit) concerning the organizational and human aspects of the work as well as medical questions, as long they are not personal (for example, “I am taking the medication X, will that be compatible with the vaccination..”).
My area of responsibility includes explaining the immunization, treatment indicators (people qualify for a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance if there is no reason that would speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care following an allergic reaction (has not happened to me yet).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. physician’s assistants.
In the vaccination teams we often don’t have any present, rather “only” (not trying to undervalue them at all!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing the vaccination, but who cannot (may not?) give vaccinations themselves, which means I am the main person who vaccinates.
Picking tires for a road bike - life without popped tires?
This morning I woke up with a fiery drive because I still wanted to at least train a bit in the upcoming weeks in preparation for my upcoming bicycle tour.
It was as easy as that and I drove my road bike which I had bought on eBay the day before.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which is always waiting for you in the intercity (this time: thanks goes to Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the road.
Pop, a loud hiss and my back tire was no longer up for riding the rest of the trip.
Because of it being a work day, I didn’t really have the chance to acquire a spare tire and tube, I had to turn back halfway through in a bad mood and take the next workable train back home.
It was not the worst downer ever, maybe it is even better if I practice changing tires one more time before I leave to go on the tour.
But now I am posed with a question and hope that you will be able to help me.
Because I have a relatively long stretch of road and many days in front of me, I would very much like to not run into this problem on a regular basis.
This time it really wasn’t that bad, because the tires were from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had already rode 120 km by 2 PM on the day I came to pick up my bicycle) and because he had described them as suboptimal, because he had already been wearing them down for many years.
But if I think about having to change tires every 80-90 km on the tour, then I am already in a really bad mood :D
I just got into a discussion with an older man at the train platform, who asked me quite surprised, why I don’t have the Marathon Plus tires, these are supposed to be impossible to pop.
Now that certainly does sound tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have no desire to give out €40 per tire in order to just be disappointed.
At the same time, I ask myself: I am using 25x622 race tires at the moment, I believe.
This is (apparently?) just like the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority of tires are actually wider.
Is that the real problem?
Or would you recommend that I really get different tires in general for the road bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to be of one opinion! Would common sense tend to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and take care!
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are going to put on the OSCAST again this year!
> It’s not possible for us - for obvious reasons - to have more than four people come into the studio, which certainly means more planning and explains the short term announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per button here, such at least 7 beans will be in the stream for the 2021 Oscars, and hopefully thousands of you following!
> We are doing our best to avoid delays and other issues.
But hey, it is still a pandemic, and because of that we are going to do our best to try to accompany the Oscars with as much entertainment as possible.
> It will start at about 12:30 AM.
Make sure to keep your drinks cold, plan some good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
