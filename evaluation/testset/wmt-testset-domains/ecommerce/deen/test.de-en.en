The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module into a single circuit board, we manage a size of only 30 mm x 15.5 mm and can thereby be built into nearly every locomotive of the track gauge H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoder is offered with all standard interfaces and always comes with a 11 x 15 mm “sugar cube” loudspeaker in addition to a sound capsule kit.
The LokSound 5 is a real multi-protocol decoder like all the members of the family.
It supports the file format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
The DCC format includes 14 to 128 speed levels, which is just as self-evident as 2 and 4 digit address and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder automatically reports back to a suitable digital command center.
It is proficient in all DCC programing modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV value can be read out on the main platform with the appropriate command center.
There are support registers for command centers that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels and 255 addresses.
Three further Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode makes re-programming possible even with the venerable 6021 control unit.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic reporting to mfx® compatible command centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distance as well as the ZIMO® HLU braking command or the Lenz® ABC system.
Even braking using DCC braking components or DC voltage is possible.
Furthermore, it also stops for a Selectrix® braking diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle allows for automatic shuttle traffic between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be implemented on analogue DC and AC current trains.

Air pumps are especially suitable for providing an aquarium with extra oxygen.
A filtration system can also be operated through an airlift pump.
We offer 3 variations in this series.
Take a look at the table at the end of this offer.
That is where you can see a comparison of services.
If the pumps are strong enough, then you can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, then a pump with two or more outlets would be make sense so that you can connect multiple jets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets depending on the model; air pumps are also useful if you want to put some accents into your aquarium, in order to have an air curtain (check our shop) or decor, which transfers the air current into a function.
A treasure chest, clam or something similar would be just the thing here.
The MK series has a special, silencing construction that allows for very little operational noise.
Installation is very simple.
The air pump is connected is connected to an outlet jet with a 4/6 mm ventilation tube...and then you are ready to go.
The air pump should be set at the same height or higher than the water level and fixed to the outside.
If the air pump is sitting lower than the water level, then you should setup a check valve in-between.
Just cut the ventilation tube and set the valve between the two parts.
This should prevent the case in which water runs backwards through the pump and out of the basin...
If the air pump is being used outside, then it should be covered and protected from humidity just like any other air pump
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that use little energy
Even if we are asking for 3 days processing time here on eBay, they are packaged daily and the packages are picked up here everyday.
If everything goes well en route, then it goes quickly.
We just want to make sure that no one is upset just because it takes a little longer.
It seems to be the case that not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in shipping...of course Corona isn’t stopping for anyone here.
Please don’t rate us poorly immediately, just because the delivery has been delayed; this is usually the fault of the shipping service.
It’s easy to be grumpy with these services, even if we have all been saying recently that they have it quite hard
This also differs greatly from region to region.
Don’t be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
By pressing a button, you can easily select whether your “Smart Stone” will stay on one color or play out the entirety of its color repertoire.
If it is set to change color, the stone keeps its color of light for about a minute before softly transferring over to the next decorative tone.
The solid construction of the “Smart Stone” light keeps it protected outside the whole year through.
In a snowy environment, the light is especially nice - although briefer light times should be expected as soon as the days get shorter.
Please just make sure that the snow doesn’t effect the functioning of the solar module in winter.
“Smart Stone” uses a NiMh battery in common format (“AA”), which can be switched out easily if needed.
You can find the right replacement batteries in our online shop and thereby further lengthen the usage life of your decorative light.

NEKTON Bio supports a smooth process of molting and coat formation.
NEKTON Bio contains all necessary vitamins, antacids, minerals and trace elements necessary for life as well as 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives birds a smooth and shiny coat.
The majority of plumage damage that occurs while keeping birds can be traced back to issues of diet.
Because the plumage is made out of a substance that contains protein, an especially rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the creation of a perfect coat of feathers.
The daily feed must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements for a functioning metabolism.
Most animal losses during molting occur because of a lack of protein or an unbalanced feed and/or an insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON Bio explicitly takes this into account and corrects for the insufficient proportion of amino acids in most plant-based feed.
No further vitamin compound should be taken while using NEKTON Bio.
NEKTON Bio can be dissolved in cold water and is very easy to administer through drinking water or soft feed.
GDR handicraft model old-style E-Locomotive E95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, item is used with traces of play and missing parts, see photos, functions well, the E95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive from the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for traction heavy coal wagons in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small production company ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN.
A locomotive can be found in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is put into comission
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft asked the AEG in 1924 for suggestions on a electro-powered locomotive, which could transport 2,200 tonnes of coal carts and 530 tonnes of passenger carts at a travelling speed of 45 km/h along this route.
The requirement for highspeed was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG therefore decided on the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with an AEG axel-hung drive along with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckert company with the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives was received with the operating numbers E95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves within the territory of what would become the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives landed in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They were then sent back to Germany in 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair depot in Dessau, the value of a renovation of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the progressing re-electrification of the central German network produced an increased need for heavy goods transport, the three locomotives E95 01 to E95 03 were restored in 1959, which left the remaining machines to serve as a source for spare parts.
Thus the preferred construction was initially the E04, E44 and E94, which were already available in large quantities.
As was first apparent with the E94, the reconditioning could not be increased further, which left the E95 as the central object of renovation.
[4] Initially the locomotives were stationed at the train depot in Leipzig-Wahren.
In 1960, they arrived at the train depot Halle P.
They were deployed on their own running schedule, usually guiding coal trains from the Geisel valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated controls of the locomotives proved problematic as they grew older.
It happened on multiple occasions that gates stayed closed during switching operations.
The co-conductor would constantly have to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the gate again during the trip.
There were often damages to drive motors, which would turn the locomotive out of comission for months.
[5] Because there were enough modern locomotives available at the end of the 1960s, and there was no major expansion of electronic operations planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could go without the old locomotives and most of the splinter types, such that the E95, were put out of operation.
It was also that case that the German Reichsbahn only wanted to have a single electronic locomotive in their possession, which had become a problem during railway operations because of “difficulties” with the machines and the visibility conditions in the driver’s cab.
[5] After the E95 02 and the E95 03 were put out of comission in mid 1969, the E95 01 soon followed in their tracks and was taken off the tracks on October 5th 1970.
The new designation that was intended, 255 001, was thus never used.
All of the locomotives except for the E95 02 were dismantled.
The E95 02 was installed as a replacement for the soon-to-be museum locomotive E77 10 as a heating system for Halle Central Station.
It took awhile before those responsible in the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E95 was worth keeping as a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the initial outer refurbishing of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it as a vehicle display in RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since then belonged to the Transportation Museum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior refurbishing of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) looks after the locomotive as a historic piece.
Since 1995, employees of the Tradition Society Bw Halle P have been working on getting the locomotive back in operation.
In April 2015, the locomotives could first be presented at an exhibition in the locomotive depot museum in Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paint, at which time the transformers were examined and five driving motors were operational.
-Since 1945, the locomotives have been deployed on the Silesian Gebirgsbahn and its branching routes, where they have proven themselves with their reliable motor and limited maintenance requirements.
The machines were then given a new home on the central German network in Leipzig in February 1945.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia
The handicraft model H0 in OVP, functions well, visual refinishing of the locomotive is necessary on your end, dusty, looks used, smells like a basement !!!, a very rare handicraft model, very limited edition, the construction kit is possibly from the small series producers ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN
The packaging could have labels attached and bear traces of storage.
In order for the application of paint to be clean and even, you should clear the components of dust, grease and finger prints using soap water and then rinse with clear water and let dry.
It is recommended that you test out 2 to 3 strokes before taking the brush to the model with a new color for the first time.
You can do this on the interior of the component, which will no longer be visible, or on a yogurt container.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
A slight overlapping of the color layers ensures for a even surface later.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This is how you get surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can result in unattractive metallic streaks when this doesn’t mix with the normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a whole day before assembling them.
Models gain an appearance that is realistic through its decals.
From national emblems on planes to ship names to the trimmings and license plates of automobiles: Decals really put the finishing touches on models.
Apply the decals in the right order whilst the components are still easy to reach.
It is easier - or even just possible - to glue onto a cockpit that is not already attached to the hull.
More important than the correct tools like scissors, tweezers or toothpicks is leaving time for gluing, having patience and using a steady hand.
Cut out each necessary decal one by one and arrange for your use.
Decals are also called “water images”, because you have to first get their backside wet with water until the paper base is darkened by wetness.
Then you push the image a tiny bit away from the paper and place it on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also wetted beforehand).
While you hold the decal to the model with a tool, pull the paper base off to the side.
Be warned: Always check first to make sure the image is sitting correctly before you push it off of the paper completely so that it doesn’t get stuck on your finger, crinkle or just tear.
Soak up surplus water with a household rag.
Caution: Not intended for children under 3-years-old
The LokSound 5 decoder can simultaneous render 10 channels at once.
Each channel can then be rendered with 16 bit/31250 kHz and offers HiFi quality for your system at the end.
There is practically no audible difference from the original.
A class D audio amplifier with up to 3 W output power controls the speakers, which may have between 4 ohm and 32 ohm impedance.
The massive 128 Mbit sound card ensures there is enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adapted to the volume.
The super flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows for the prototypically accurate simulation of all imaginable railway vehicles.
Three separate adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios offer you maximum control over your vehicle.
In order to achieve an optimal visual field, the magnifying glass should be as close to the eye as possible.
The special aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the peripheral zone practically without contamination or color errors.
Magnifying glasses are often designated by their magnifying specifications.
These specifications are only valid, however, for exactly defined circumstances which very rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally we ask you to pay attention to the “Technical Data” table in the notes (see the operating manual in the delivery package).
Light reflections appear on the lens’ surface of all optical equipment, even folding magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating can significantly reduce these reflections.
By adhering to these optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass right up to the eye - the lens surface reflections are much less noticeable.
Further tips can be found in the included operating manual (available in both German and English).

Whether it’s a comforter for stomach pain or simply for cuddling: My little warm friend has many uses.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home cure for soothing applications of warmth, because the cherry pits absorb warmth very well and then release it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be warmed up rather easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The smooth cover makes use especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure even if it’s not going so well for them.
The cherry pit cushion with cover is a warm application suitable only for the following uses:
Check for atypical smells, mold and burn marks before warming and dispose of it immediately if they are found.
Please take the interior cushion out of the cover before warming it up!
Warm up in the microwave at max. 300 watt for max. 2 minutes (pay attention to the directions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Spread the warmth evenly throughout right after heating by shaking the pillow!
Afterwards put the interior cushion back inside of the cover.
A little bit of wetness can appear on the surface during the first time warming up, however, this will disappear following repeated use.
Please pay attention to the given warming instructions, since longer times or more power can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before you warm up the pillow in the microwave, check to make sure that the heating of seeds is allowed in the user manual of the manufacturer.
As soon as the heated inner cushion is put back inside its cover, please check that the temperature of the cushion is suitable for babies (max. 43°C) using the crook of your arm.
Don’t use the cushion during current or chronic, inflamed or feverish illnesses, circulation issues, fresh hemorrhoids, blood clots and open wounds as well as on people with low pain tolerances.
Please ask a doctor before using during active skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor-related diseases, or in the case of pregnancy.
Should seems open up and spare pits fall out, dispose of the product and immediately make the pits inaccessible to children.
If the product is to be used on children under the age of 1, then the temperature of the child during use should be regularly checked to exclude the possible of overheating!
Report all difficult incidences that arise while using the product to the manufacturer and to the responsible governing body, in whose jurisdiction the user lives.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please read the maintenance symbol on the product!
Are you often out trekking but still have a lot of equipment?
This isn’t a problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With 20 liters of load capacity it can envelop larger photo equipment without a problem, which can be stored safely thanks to the upholstered FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other daily necessities you need can be kept well organized and separated from the photography equipment in individual, adjustable interior spaces with practical access points.
The series is presenting itself with a new look following the Version 2 (V2) “update” to the Everyday line.
The sleek, minimalist design already has everything in itself, as the proverb goes - Peak Design developed its own, highly-innovative solutions with the Everyday Backpack series, which reliably protects the interior of the backpack but still allows for access to the photo equipment within a few short seconds.
This functions because of two possibilities: A conventional method via the fold-over cover, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an impressively thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself for messenger bags.
As part of this, a locking, metal hook is located in the locking flap with corresponding anchors on the front of the backpack.
Peak Design also thought of different degrees of “fullness”, which makes it a distinct design: this includes 4 stable anchors, to which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, just use the highest anchor, if it is almost empty, use a lower one.
Locking flaps and hooks are especially magnetic.
That is how the backpack can be reliably closed even without using the hooks.
The second possibility makes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally different from other photographers’ backpacks: There are also zipper openings next to the fold-over cover on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest downside to conventional backpacks with an opening at the top - you don’t have to fumble through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily usefulness of the backpack enormously: This doesn’t just help if you are caring photo equipment, but also for everyday objects, or for use as a travel bag.
Inside of the Everyday Backpack you can customize the individual interior spaces (more on that below) and in so doing store both types of item separately without issue - and have independent access to them through the side openings.
That is also how you can access the backpack out the right side of the body in order to, for example, access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday objects can remain secure in the left half of the backpack without anything coming between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable usability really helps with this.
The outer shell of the backpack is also made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, which can keep the inner contents dry during an autumn trip to Scotland.
Rotinger disc brakes are designed to handle dynamic driving, to be reliable and safe while braking and to be really shine under difficult circumstances.
Rotinger disc brakes are made from cast iron and then mechanically processed (bored and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in smaller series on the basis of individual, technical characteristics, which are suitable for certain discs and designs.
On the basis of the individual, technical designation, a special manufacturing process is created that is directed at balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tuned discs, which are manufactured according to this method, ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of disk cooling, whereby sectioning improves the cleaning of disc brakes and the brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned discs emphasize the character of the car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city, in which something unexpected happened in the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern fork of the American river discovered a brilliant nugget in the water.
Even though he attempted to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread very quickly and lead to the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands of people from near and far turned Coloma into one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Ground were staked out, tents were put up, saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their part in the riches of the land.
The motto for many was: “Coloma or Bust”!
In this game, you are a pioneer, who is looking for riches in the West and who wants to make a name for yourself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, roundup horses and build up enterprises.
You will also have the opportunity, to explore the length of nearby rivers and the bordering lands.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order to not go broke like the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneous choose your actions, economize with your resources and setup a board, which “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on this board allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to bend rules in your favor.
With the help of subtle adjustments, you can develop your own individual play style with these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles.
Coloma takes place over the span of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) up until 1850 (the year that California officially received its statehood).
A year in Coloma is made up of five rounds.
During every round, the players will simultaneously select a position on the board in secret where they will carry out their actions.
After this, their choices will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, then it gets a block!
This deactivates one half of the location, which then reduces the number of possible actions there.
The players then take turns performing actions, like, for example, gaining resources, moving wagons, putting up tents, searching rivers, building a bridge, opening a business or positioning gunslingers.
When all actions have been concluded, the pioneers can return.
The advertiser turns at the beginning of each round towards a different location and changes thereby what actions are available.
This goes on until the advertiser has turned around five times, which means they covered every location and the year is over.
There is a stand-off in which the players have to protect Coloma against an ambush by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and they are numerically superior to the bandits, then they get rewarded.
If they fail, then they get less rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends in a third stand-off after which comes the final scoring.
The player with the most victory points wins!
I can take on the delivery type, shipment (game wrapped in foil) up to a size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
Everything else is DPD insured with package tracking, for the most part (game wrapped in foil, fleece and wrapping paper).
If you are a collector, then I can also send over the box in a box for an additional 2 euro, so that it definitely stays in pristine condition.
The “drive” of a tube amplifier contributes considerably to the warmth and the fat tone of the guitar amplifier.
These aspects are implemented perfectly by the Valve reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust desired levels on the one hand and the distortion of the sound on the other hand.
Furthermore, the amplifier of the VT+ series offers a unique POWER LEVEL knob with which you can reduce the sound level without changing the “gain” and the distortion at all.
As mentioned above, the POWER LEVEL knob can even be used for power reserve when it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL knob, the whole potential of the VT+ series is usable in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal that is sent through here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get a eminently “acoustic” sound impression even when using headphones or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can even be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam along to your favorite hits.
A tuner function is also on board, which means you don’t need a separate tuning device.
Whoever wants to buy a VFS5 footswitch, can also conveniently call up sounds with their foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is truly a necessity for use onstage.
VOX is taking a further step into the future with their new powerhouses!

The protein which is absorbed through the feed is digested by the bird into protein blocks (amino acids) in the gastrointestinal tract; it then uses these to build proteins suited for its own body, which are necessary for coat formation.
The coat formation for birds while nestling and molting are especially complex processes and connected to an especially high level of stress for the whole organism of the animal.
Please remember that NEKTON Bio is not to be used while breeding, because it can result in disruptions in blood circulation.
Following the curative administration of NEKTON Bio, a return to daily vitamin intake with NEKTON S (multi-vitamin compound) and NEKTON MSA (mineral compound) is recommended.

1 g NEKTON Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is recommended that you only prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as required to meet the animals daily needs and that water/feed is switched out daily.
A level spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In cases of extreme damage to the plumage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given to start with until the coat visibly starts to grow again.
After which the normal dosage is enough to fully realize coat formation.
Storage: Store NEKTON Bio in a dry place, out of the way of direct sunlight, at a temperature between 15-25°C.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine, which is the absolute state-of-the-art in the field of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which utilizes an analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifier puts forth an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the multi-leveled Valvetronix tube amplifiers, of course.
This deals with real analogue circuits, because these simply are better than any simulation at obtaining the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifier offers a closed casing and bass reflex system, from which natural resonances just burst out.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on a virtual plane until the amp and the effects sound just like you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is above all thanks to the VOX valve reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has been refined ever since then in order to handle new sound requirements, which in 2010 lead to a renewed power boost to the VOX Valvetronix series with more dynamics as well as numerous, decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has additionally been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they need here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a tube amp: They want a fat sound, a nuanced playback of playing dynamics and chord strokes, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage above all else determines the tube character of an amplifier and they developed the VOX Valve reactor technology on the basis of this discovery.
The Valve reactor circuit of any VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube produces the character, the subtle nuances and the sound shape of a tube amplifier perfectly.
Apart from that, the large main compartment is also adjustable: it can really match the needs of your photo equipment with three individual moveable and foldable Velcro-fastened parts, which make it suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras in all sizes to full-sized, mirror reflex cameras.
What will fit into the backpack is of course dependent on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible option would be the DSLFR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras and different models of the Sony AY7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave even more room for lenses.
Apart from that, you can also store a number of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for equipment and for other, non-camera related things.
Drone pilots are also making a good choice with the 20 L Everyday Backpack, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
The decorative lights mix harmoniously into each flower bed, gardening plot or rock garden.
The lights are easy to setup and can be anchored into the ground with 2 stakes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the integrated battery.
Battery life, max. 10h.
- The robust plastic design can be deployed in outdoor areas all year.
According to Hollywood, It is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow from within.
In contrast, our “Smart Stone” is totally harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light beams in a fascinating way - available in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The smooth, amorphous design is an intentional choice: This modern illuminating object appears to be your average pebble during the day.
Its organic roundness can fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the patio, in the lawn or in a stone garden.
It also fits in well along side larger pebbles and boulders, where it really knows how to hold its own given its size.
You can spare yourself a lot of the prep work: As a solar light, “Smart Stone” doesn’t need a plug or batteries.
Place the “illuminating stone” at one of your favorite spots that is exposed to the sun on a daily basis.
Two stakes can ensure a secure hold, if needed.
The matte white plastic shell is itself robust and water-resistant.
The solar module of “Smart Stone” is discretely hidden in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs - one white and one colored.
The battery begins to charge whenever sunlight falls on the shell.
As dusk falls, the “Smart Stone” starts to illuminate on its own; you can pick the color yourself: In addition to a daylight white, you have a choice of six different, attractive colors of light.
Turning off also occurs automatically as soon as the battery power reaches a set minimum or if it starts to get bright again.
As soon as the sun shines once more, the charging cycle begins for the next day.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 was fundamentally improved once again.
A variable, adjustable PWM pulse frequency of 10 kHz to 50 kHz makes sure that performance is superb, especially for bell-type armature motors - Your typical “hum” is a thing of the past.
Load regulation can now be adjusted to 10 CVs for difficult cases.
The unique “Autotune” function allows for the automatic calibration of the decoders on the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder with up to 1.5 A engine current delivers enough juice even for old motors.

The lamp is constructed for dual balance and is based on new, flat SMD LEDs with top performance and top color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor provides for the setting of the color temperature and the brightness of the lamp allowing for extraordinary possibilities.
Apart from adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is possible to manually set the color temperature to between 3100 - 5650 K and to save the setting.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
Simple and intuitive control is a special characteristic of the controller.
The bulbs produces a light current with soft light of a high-quality and totally free of flickering.
The 120 degree lighted angle is exceptional and is able to illuminate large spaces at relatively short distances.
This includes situations that reporters run into with small spaces and short distances.
The brightness can be changed with practically no effect on the color temperature.
It is an impressive tool that works on the film set as well as in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remote controlled in television studios or when the lights are in difficult to access places.
The control panel is on the back of the lights and consists of buttons and a lighted display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, that is where the slot for NP-F batteries can be found (not included in the scope of delivery)
User Memory: There are three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to execute the settings of the memory’s individual settings, you must simply make a sustained press of one of the memory keys and that’s it.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when you turn it off such that when you turn it back on the familiar situation is restored - Very useful for working in a studio if, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with battery: One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 is that it allows you to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
Many photographers and cameramen (and camerawomen) already have these - which means they can reach back to equipment that they already own.
The DL3120 also allows you to check the battery power before coming on set - it includes a battery tester - with a value for both battery slots on the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right battery on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course also possible to continually supply the lamp with power using the mains adaptor that was delivered along with it.
Setting up the lamp is very easy.
It has a 16 mm sleeve for mounting so you can connect it directly to your tripod.
The incline can be reliably set on both sides using the adjusters.

After the release of our new high-end full-range speakers B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series got some new blood.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and is optically reminiscent of the larger models with B 200 - 6 OHM .
However, a suitably designed food was included directly in the construction proposal, which would raise the speaker to the correct, audible position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can be adjusted lengthwise to fit the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people, for whom maximum volume doesn’t really play a big role, but for whom an especially high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not up to the task of producing such practically unfiltered, large sound pressure levels.
That doesn’t mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Rather it appears especially mature, impressive and accurate for its size.
Concerning tone, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is usually the case with full-range speakers in order to optimize the strongly increasing bunching of the higher frequencies.
Directed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 is convincing with a very clear and fine sound.
If turned slightly to the side, the high tones can be reduced, which allows for a warmer sound.
Thanks to the directed sound, the positioning of the individual components of the piece of music in an optimal stereo triangle is sharp as a knife and astonishingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which should be mentioned, ensure fine dynamics that are in a league of their own.
The SOLO 15 is not just supplementing the SOLO series, rather it is expanding it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
Like all of our assembly kits, we recommend that you consider the final optics of the speakers in order to plan the necessary alterations into its construction.
For instance, if you would like to apply a veneer to the case, the lowering of the speaker need to be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies another materiel.
After all boards have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), a 8 mm hole should first be bored into the floor boards at the appropriate position in order later lead a cable through it without any issues.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is the next to come such that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be setup level.
This opening should be allow for a 45° chamber on the bac side in order to create the largest possible open area space inside of the speaker case.
The four screw points on the B 100 - 6 OHM get thereby an interruption of the chamfer, as is shown in the image, “Detail Chamfer”.
Begin here with the actual construction of the box, position one of the two side walls on a level plane in front of you.
The back wall, the top, the front and the floor are all glued onto this piece.
At the same time, the three reinforcements should be set and glued.
The material strength of the reinforcements can vary according to need, in that you can, for example, use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of constructing them out of 16 mm MDF yourself.
The second side is then attached in the next phase.
After that, all boards of the foot, that is, the two sides as well as the front.
It is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear panel by using a suitable circular hole saw or Forstner drill.
After that, use a circular miller to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the foot board can also be rounded here.
Then the foot board is securely glued to the foot of the case and screwed on additionally with long wooden screws.
After that comes the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker case and the terminal.
After the housing unit has been cleared of all dust (vacummed/blown), begin with the laying of the cables.
The easiest way is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
For this, push the whole, unshortened cable inch by inch through the 8 mm hole in the foot up to the terminal opening and let it poke out there about 30 cm.
At the top part of the case, the cable is guided through the speaker opening and then just left to hang out loose there.
The crossover unit is then prepared and installed.
The construction plan of the crossover unit, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken out of the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connecting terminal is screwed in, then next comes the sealing of the 8 mm cable hole in the interior of the box, which has not been entirely closed off.
With some dexterity, you can let hot glue drop onto the opening through the 35 mm bass reflex opening, which then seals it.
The seal can then be checked through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM with a small lamp.
The dampening now occurs according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and secured with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is then shortened to the designated length of 28 mm (whole length of the tube) and inserted in.
A length of dampening material is then cut in two and loosely placed inside of the housing unit for dampening purposes.
The opening of the bass reflex canal should be kept open.
