Omicron’s why: Johnson wants to push booster shoots
The increase in Omicron cases is concerning for politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
That is why all qualified adults in England should receive a vaccine before the new year.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would like to increase the rate of Corona booster shots with an eye on rapidly increasing Omicron figures.
Every adult in England should really have the chance before the end of the year to receive a booster shot as long as three months have passed since the first immunization, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video announcement to his countrymen.
The previous goal had been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the vaccination campaign can also be accelerated in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Because of the Omicron variant, we are in an emergency situation, which is why vaccination protection really needs to be increased, Johnson said.
It seems the good news is that the level of protection increases after a third vaccination dose.
“Let’s get boosted!”, Johnson said.
1,239 additional Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain on Sunday, which puts the total number at 3,137.
This was an increase of 65 percent in comparison with the previous day. dpa
“Arcane” on Netflix: What is the series’ relation to “League of Legends”?

Why are we excited about the two seasons that were announced?
National basket ball league: Derby-Debakel, MHP Ludwigsburg Giants at Merlins Crailsheim
At least the youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing, again: For the second time within less than three months the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
John Patrick, the trainer for Ludwigsburg, said before the game in reference to the previous finals loss in the beginning of October to HAKRO Crailsheim Merlins that: “We are still angry about it”.
But this was note put to rest after the game, but rather it increased once again after the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the basketball league.
It wasn’t just the score that was disappointing, but also the way they showed up.
A statistic was given for this which expresses the whole dilemma: The triple quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) and a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: “We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we didn’t put into practice what we had trained.”
They just didn’t move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted much differently: “It was an awesome game winning for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” the happy coach said.
“It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people.”
750 people were let into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, and they got what they paid for.
Not least of all because of the BBL top shooter T.J. Shorts, who landed 22 pointes and steered the game for his team.
“The best player, who I have ever trained,“ said Gleim in praise.
While at the same time on Patricks Team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed when they got to the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after which they were knocked back down to 39:59.
Not just Johannes Patrick but Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
There was luckily not a lot of time to fight.
On Wednesday (7 PM) the giants will already host Skyliners Frankfurt in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
Always spick and span: Max Raabe turns 59
He excited his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At that time he was working with the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück” - when he was allowed to appear there.
This weekend Max Raabe really wanted to celebrate his birthday on Sunday on stage in Leipzig.
Nothing will come of it.
The already planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - “at the request of the authorities,” in order to dampen the corona virus.
Other concerts of his planned for the Christmas season had to be cancelled first, as is stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January the artist wants to catch up on his appearances that have all already been postponed since 2020 because of the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhein-Westphalia, Max Raabe already enjoyed singing as a teenager whenever he could.
In Berlin he trained as an opera singer and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with his classmates.
Since then the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded a number of prizes.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his breakout album “Für Frauen ist das kein Problem” (2013).
He was able to make something mainstream out of something niche.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair combed back and with a sense of decorum, the contemporary German-speaking musical landscape is impossible to imagine without Max Raabe.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück.” dpa
Federal Construction Minster Klara Geywitz: No new apartments will come as a result of expropriation
The new Federal Construction Minster Klara Geywitz (SPD) spoke against the expropriation of large housing corporations as has been required by a referendum in Berlin.
“No new housing is created with expropriation, it just changes the way property is structured,” Geywitz said in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give security to renters that their rent stays affordable in the years to come.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives and housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly anyway.
A coalition of the SPD, Greens and the Left would like to deploy an expert comission to figure out how best to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not calm itself down, Geywitz determined, discussions with the FDP in the Streetlight Coalition about further intensification of rental rights are not off the table.
The coalition agreement stipulates a rent freeze extending to 2029, placing a limit on rental increases in tense housing markets along with the expansion of the rental index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to order to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not become more bearable, then “we will speak with our partners in the coalition about further measures,” emphasized the SPD politician.
At least 100 dead following a tornado in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes tore through the USA during a devastating series of storms.
There were more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
Images from the area look like a warzone.
Many tornadoes simultaneously laid waste in the USA on the night on Saturday and most likely caused hundreds of deaths.
The storms left a stretch of devastation about 320 kilometer long, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Following a visit to the disaster zone, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear said everything was gone wherever the tornado tore through.
Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone.
Parts from industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that that is even possible.
He is going with the figure of at least one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky, the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and other slogans
While the federal government has turned down the motion for a vaccination bonus once again, companies in Austria have taken up the initiative themselves and offer their employees remuneration for vaccination.
In that way they are together with the Austrian Federation of Trade Unions and the chamber of commerce, who are pushing for financial incentives for vaccinations.
Readiness to have a Corona vaccination has also increased thanks to the tweaking of vaccination slogans on the German example.
Amazon Founder Bezo sends astronaut’s daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four more passengers will undertake a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system “New Shepard” from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin.
The launching and landing of the circa ten minute flight took place in the west of Texas in the USA.
Bezos personally greeted the astronauts following their landing in a very personal fashion underneath a beaming blue sky.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, who was wearing a blue space suit as he opened the hatch of the capsule.
The six passengers climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder in the midst of applause from friends, family and coworkers at Blue Origin.
According to reports from Blue Origin they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew with NASA into space in 1961 and from whom the rocket system of Blue Origin gets its name, and the fifty-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were the special guests of the company; the other four passengers paid for their tickets: The spaceship engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick and technology entrepreneur Lane Bess as well as his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not reveal how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley thinks back after the short flight on the mission of her father.
He worked hard during his deployment and always was doing things himself.
They had just flown along, the 74-year-old said with a smile.
Even Michael Strahan let his excitement show.
He would really like to go right back up into space, the moderator said.
“New Shepard” flew up to a height of 100 kilometer
The rocketing system “New Shepard” was flying automatically for the most part.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometer above the earth, briefly hanging in zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again after being slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviary Association and many other experts view 100 kilometer above the earth as the border of space, that being said, there is no binding international consensus.
This has then been the third manned space flight of Blue Origin: The first time in June: Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot as well as an 18-year-old from the Netherlands.
The second time in October: the ninety-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner came along, who is famous around the world for playing the role of “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek”, apart from that, the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers came too.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely making a business of space tourism that is void of any scientific research interest that could benefit humanity and that they are doing so without taking into account environmental damages.
Yvonne Catterfeld is happy about Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy about Christmas in her hometown in Thüringen - but still doesn’t have any presents.
“The beautiful thing is that even if there is not supposed to be any snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest,” the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
They are going to join in on the festivities, at which she will bake cookies with her son and do crafts.
“I love it,” Catterfeld said.
She still has a few things to figure out before those tranquil days: “For the first time I don’t have any presents, I really need to just get out there.”
Apartment fire causes two people light injuries and a lot in damages
Two people were lightly injured in an apartment building fire in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, property damages estimated in the six figures occurred as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire probably broke out from a carport at the neighboring apartments in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
Two residents were brought to the hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday according to reports.
The exact source of the fire was not initially known, but the police do not believe at this time that it was intentional arson.
Fürstenfeldbruck criminal investigations have taken over further investigations.
In order to rebut fake news, the Biontech CEO published a vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination from the beginning of 2021 on the social network “LinkedIn”
Biontech head Uğur Şahin had previously not discussed his immunization status publicly.
Now the businessman is publishing a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The sickness of his friend brought him to do it, said Şahin.
CEO and cofounder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo that showed how he received an immunization against the Corona virus.
There was incorrect information on social networks that I was actually not vaccinated.
Actually my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer immunization,” Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the “LinkedIn” platform.
“For the last few months friends of mine have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting immunized in order to clear up this untrue rumor”.
He had been putting it off up until now, because he didn’t want to make the conversation about himself.
But a call in the past weeks changed his mind: “I was deeply touched, as I discovered that an old school mate of mine was fighting for his life.
He was fighting against a serious Covid 19 infection and had been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
The school mate and his family are not immunized, said Şahin in his statement.
He didn’t ask why.
“The most common cause seems to be fear, which is usually stirred up by false information and mistrust.”
It is difficult to conquer fear with facts, that is why sometimes it’s better to just share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle was circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not immunized.
However, this video was made in December 2020 as Deutsche Welle was clear about.
“It is not legally possible for me to receive the vaccination,” said Şahin back then.
There were priority groups for receiving the vaccination in Germany.
The priority groups have long since been removed - and the Biontech head had since been vaccinated three times according to his statements.
Fire in the switchyard: Ten-thousand people without electricity
The light went out in multiple municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday night: no more electricity, in many cases the heating also went out.
A fire put a switchyard out of comission.
After a fire that caused serious damages in a switchyard, tens of thousands of people in Rhein-Sieg county in North Rhein-Westphalia had to manage without power for about 24 hours.
The lights went out for about 41,000 residents in multiple municipalities on Friday evening because of the fire.
The utility company Westnetz reported that on Saturday there were numerous back-up generators in operation up until the disturbance that effected such a large area could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
The fire brigade and contributors to the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) provided support to the communities.
The departments offered support stations inside of schools and called on neighborly assistance.
The supplier thanked those effected for their patience and their help during the operation.
It is very clear to us that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions along with it.
We are also thankful to the effected communities, the county, the fire brigade and the THW for their enduring commitment during deployment,” head of primary technologies, Florian Witt, said in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repairing of damages will begin in the next few days, since the Westnetz technicians can only temporarily restore operation to some services, he explained.
A technical defect was responsible for the fire, according to company statements.
Energy is flowing again
The company states that the fire, which broke out at 7:15 PM on Friday, caused serious damage in the switchyard of the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid sections of the 10,000 Volt substation.
That is where serious cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, connection was made to a 30,000 V system.
The energy supply was restored again thanks in part to this bypass.
21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have been living with electricity since 6 PM on Saturday.
Starting at 9:30 PM, a further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had at least partial power restoration.
Since 11:15 PM, the last of the electricity that was out since the failure was restored.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The public departments called for additional help from the neighborhood around noon on Saturday after having secured emergency energy supply to vital buildings.
“The important thing is that citizens take care of those who are older or who are living alone and report to the local fire brigade houses, when help is needed”, clarified County Commissioner Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following the emergency meeting.
Residents of retirement homes stood in focus during the commissioning and operation of back-up generators.
Additionally, provisional care stations were set up in schools, according to government statements, for all people who could not care for themselves or who required energy dependent medical devices or care.
Nordic combined: Combined skier Rießle wins
The German Nordic combined skier Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

“Half victory” against Belarus carries high cost for EU partners
The EU came in conflict with the Belarussian government according to political expert Raphael Bossong because of the announcement of a “half victory”.
The costs are too high and that means massive loses of rights for migrants and asylum seekers on Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).
The researcher of the foundation Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) in Berlin explained that the EU has not solved this manner in a meaningful way.
This unresolved state - Belarus doesn’t back down, but the EU still feels like the winner - is probably just going to continue.
The living environment of people on the border is not up to the standards of the European Human Rights Convention, determined Bossong.
Obviously there is an “increasing normalization of push-backs” coming through via individual EU regulations.
Because the EU as a whole is not in a decided position towards it, the cost will be fundamental human rights.
This development weakens unity in the union as well.
“They are clearly not able to do anything if a member state gets it into their head to do their own thing,” just like Poland who has not once allowed the EU border protection agency Frontex onto their border.
Therefore the EU is paying a further price for their policies on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A clear position on asylum policies is made difficult by the fact that the slogan “border protection, border protection, border protection” is getting louder.
A renewed attempt to cross over the border
According to Polish border police migrants have attempted once again to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a representative of the department said on Sunday.
The migrants reportedly threw stones at the Polish officials before being captured near Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a solider was hit in the face and had to be cared for by a military doctor.
Border police registered a total of 52 attempted border crossers within 24 hours.
On Friday night a group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border fortifications.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border into the EU through Belarus in the past months.
The EU accuses leader Alexander Lukaschenko of having enticed them to come for the purpose of increasing immigration into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have blocked press reports concerning that section of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and put pressure on aviation firms who were bringing in migrants and refugees.
That is why EU commissioners are traveling to these countries of origin to prevent departures from there.
The most successful element of the EU reaction was putting pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“Because the EU threw their market power onto the scale and put their determination to test and fought hard and operated extraterritorial sanctions”.
Minsk also has to take into account the cost of domestic politics.
The Belarussian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is boycotting the contested Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen broke the rules twice while the race was underway according to a statement from Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes protested following the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The “Silver Arrow” suspects two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The claim refers to the apparent violation from Max Verstappen of Red Bull in the last safety car phase as he passed someone in violation of the rules.
A second claim was laid against the scoring after the race.
According to Mercedes, protocol was not regularly followed.
Verstappen was still able to pass over Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes in the last round and dashed to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred right after the end of a safety car round, in which the Dutchman passed the car driving in front of him.

When the time comes to change your checking account
Whoever thought that it was all peace and quiet for checking accounts must now feel like a fool.
While many banks spent autumn getting customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are falling further as well.
For example, Deutsche Bank has seemed generous in comparison with its 100,000 euro limit.
Now they have halved the tax allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
As a first step, the limits for children in the partner group Postbank were sunk to 50,000 euro for checking and investment accounts and 25,000 euro for daily allowance accounts.
In the meantime, however, these low tax allowances now apply to the whole of Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And this is not just for new contracts, but also for “newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers”.
Commerzbank had already sunk to a limit of 50,000 euro, which still applies - the same can be said of ING Germany.
Direktbank, DKB, a beloved option for cost-conscious customers, lowered its tax allowance in two steps, first to 50,000 euro and now to 25,000 euro.
Still: In the meantime, more than 100 banks now have a tax allowance of 25,000 euro or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda Bank Berlin has also come to 25,000 euro: However, a legal battle is still taking place with consumer groups, who have already claimed their rights against these changes in the first instance in front of a Berlin regional court.
It is already being discussed at the banks whether the institutions should have provisions in place just in case the high courts declare negative interest to be impermissible and many millions need to be paid back to bank accounts.
Jennifer Aniston engages a whole beauty army
She is now officially on the top of Hollywood.
However, her life has been a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected as the most influential woman of the year by the American magazine “The Hollywood Reporter”.
This acknowledgment is first and foremost the result of much discipline and hard word for her, who made headlines again following her 2021 “Friends” reunion and the extension of her series, “The Morning Show”.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are taking care of her look.
In any case, she still allows herself a chip a day, according to Aniston (yes, that’s right, a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
It is a wonder that the hearts of her fans, male and female, are still beating so hard for her.
Maybe because she has always had bad luck, but still continued to search for that true love.
And crossed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she had always been asked when she was going to become a mother.
That caused her pain.
The people who ask this have no idea what is going on with me personally, that is, medically, and why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
There remains the hope that success and fame will bring happiness.
An unworthy end to a carrier: Räikkönen needs to give up
Kimi Räikkönens departure from Formula 1 went by quieter as was expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
Following a driving error and some light praise from a group of fans, Räikkönen needed to park his Alfa Romeo after less than a half of the race distance during the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” ended his carrier in the hall of motorsport kings.
His wife and two children were also travelling in the United Arab Emirates as part of his departure.
Räikkönen’s greatest victory was his win at the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won the Grand Prix 21 times, he launched from the pole 18 times and came onto the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte in a two-man bobsled - Sports
The bobsled driver’s goal is to beat the record of the Norwegian biathlons Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 wins.
“I ran the numbers, I need to bring in nine-and-a-half victories per season, then it’d be doable by Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who was able to land two victories in two days during the races in Winterberg.
He first fought off the attacks of Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, jumping from third to the top.
Then he changed something on the material settings and managed a great leap forward of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
Along with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he pulled himself ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took on a great risk today and we were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after coming in second before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth place after landing in fourth in the first run.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would also do that,” Lochner said.
Nolte with win at home - Podium for Jamanka

It was super cool for me to stand first place on the podium in the World Cup, I am super happy, that Mariama took me along with.
I am overjoyed with the development.
There is still a lot of potential when starting, the starting times today were only okay,” said Burghardt and emphasized: “It is not just about the push start, but involves a lot of things related to that”.
Jamanka was a little frustrated with the not totally perfect run, but admitted: “It’s a step in the right direction”.

Holetschek: The states are discussing removing the test requirement for thrice immunized people
The states’ health ministers would like to discuss in their next meeting a nationwide elimination of the test requirement for people with three immunizations.
“The states need clarity fast about if and when the test requirement for thrice immunized people can be done away with,” Chairperson of the Health Minister Conference Klaus Holetschek (CSU) told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
The elimination of 2G plus for people with three immunizations is “not only medically advisable but also offers additional incentive to get vaccinated,” said Holetschek.
The Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) added that, “the Health Ministers’ Conference would already like to made a recommendation on this for the upcoming Tuesday”. - afp

Iran sees advances in negotiations concerning the nuclear deal
Progress was made according to Iranian sources during negotiations over a revival of the international atomic agreement.
“Both sides are really close to coming to an agreement concerning different themes, which should be standing on the daily agenda,” said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a “positive and important development,” because at the beginning there was no kind of agreement on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should inhibit Iran from the development of nuclear weapons.
The Vienna discussions on the revival of the agreement were put in motion again on Thursday after a short one week break.
Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia were all at the table for the discussions.
A US delegation was also on location in Vienna, but they were only indirectly taking part in the negotiations.
Thüringen has overtaken Saxony - the free state now has the highest rate of Corona infection
Thüringen replaced Saxony and currently holds the highest incidence rate in the country.
This single federal state now has a value above the 1,000 mark.
Thüringen was the single state on Sunday that was over the 1000 mark for Corona infections.
The Robert Koch Institute released the figure of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence rate in the whole country, the figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence rate had sunken somewhat in Thüringen on Friday and Saturday, however it still lay above the 1,000 line.
2,242 new infections of the Sars CoV2 Virus and 16 infection-related deaths were reported in Thüringen within a single day.
200 serious Covid 19 cases were treated in intensive care facilities in hospitals on Sunday.
There may have also have been delayed reporting on the weekend.
Additionally, the health departments have been overburdened for weeks already and can hardly deal with the new cases.
The Lahnsteiner weir is equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the district
At the Lahnsteiner Town Hall, the Interior Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Roger Lewentz recently handed over to the Mayor Peter Labonte a grant declaration to the amount of 45,000 euro towards the new equipment vehicle for water rescue for the volunteer firefighters in Lahnstein.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, lay at about 135,000 euro.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us with this,” said Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the diving squad of Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rheinland Palatine.
They are fulfilling water and ice rescue missions as well as providing technical assistance both above and under water.
They have been dealing with more and more operations in Lahnstein: The boom in floating hotels on the Rhein and Mosel as well as the always increasing use of the Lahn as a river for free-time enjoyment has contributed to this.

A volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flow on the Canary island has caused massive damage.
Is there an end in sight?
Lasting 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest eruption in recorded history on the Spanish Canary island.
Previously the longest eruption of the Tehuya volcano on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa was in 1585 and lasted 84 days.
There is no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja had even started to lessen in past days, but volcanologists do not dare to give a prediction on when it could end.
The indicators are pointing to a slow down.
The best news is that it is stable,” the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, said to the public TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages are now in the millions
In the just about three months since the beginning of the eruption, the over 1000°C lava has destroyed 2,900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE reports.
Almost 1,200 hector were covered by the meter-thick layer of lava.
That is about 1,700 football fields.
Almost 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at about 900 million euro.
Frozen lava has resulted in two new headlands off the coast with a total size of about 50 hector.
The islands immensely important banana plantations were the most hard hit, from which about half of the 85,000 residents live, directly or indirectly, and which were already in crises mode before the volcanic eruption.
225 hector of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas were severely effected, according to the newspaper “El País”.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is just in front of the door and the holy festival will certainly be enjoyed by children the most.
The many bright presents under the Christmas tree have something tempting about them as they combine with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of a few traditional occasions which still bind together our increasingly split society.
That is why it is so important that the Christmas tradition of gift giving is done consciously, so that the gesture of giving, which has been called a “social contract of primitive people” by the French Sociologist and Ethnologist Marcel Mauss, which offers an escape from routine that can then be filled with new life by the context around these traditions.
Just as Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking it was the protestants who were the first to connect the Christmas days closely with gift giving.
Previously, gifts had been exchanged in many different ways on Saint Nicholas Day.
The background behind this tradition, which is still alive today, is that the bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas, secretly threw money into the windows of three women one night to save them from living in sin anymore.
This unconventional manner of gift giving preceded the beloved practice in Germany of filling children’s shoes with presents.
Protestants took offense at this tradition because they rejected middlemen between God and man as "veneration of saints."
In this manner, they provide resistance to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby founded a new line of tradition.
The focus on gift giving was then pushed onto Christmas Eve.
Because most Protestants no longer view such niche questions so literally, only a few are still annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas - like the Martin custom with its singing and parade - is still an integral part of the time leading up to Christmas.
Today you will find everything the heart desires stuffed into boots in front of the bedroom door and everything from socks to luxury watches under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian lands
Sources point to traditions of gift giving going as far back as the 13th century for Saint Nicholas Day.
Following the reformation, the tradition of gift giving was pushed onto Christmas Eve.
All over Christendom there is a happy mix-up when it comes to the question of when the children are brought presents.
In Germany, religion is decisive on Christmas Eve regarding the question of Christ Child or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas that has been given his own qualities with the passage of time.
This includes his white bushy beard, for example, which really has little in common with the much more strict Assyrian beard of the historic figure, or his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, or his preference for using the chimney to enter homes.
Holy Nicholas remains the central Christmas figure in the Netherlands.
In Spain it is the three wise men that bring presents, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who supposedly lead the way to Baby Jesus.
Sometimes in Scandinavia the presents are brought by creatures from fables, while in Russia, Father Frost has gained in popularity.
It is not reindeers, but rather a triumvirate of three horses that pull his sled.
The Christ Child is responsible for the giving of presents in the Czech Republic, the mother country of the reformation following the Hussite Wars.
Police shoot and kill a suspected bank robber near the Königspalast
Near the Kensington Palace in London a man with a gun was shot to death by police on Saturday.
The police released as statement saying that callers had reported a man with a gun went into a bank and the office of a printers.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officials not long after.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
Police are not assuming it to be a terrorist attack.
Multiple embassies are located near Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
In the name of the people: Lay people give out judgement
They are sitting in everyday clothes at the judge’s bank in the courthouse.
A lot is depending on their decision, even if they are not wearing robes: Jurors are determining with professional judges if and for how long someone is behind bars.
Two of them are reporting in a conversation with the “Oeffentlichen” about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher regional court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges of the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
110 kV underground cables will be lain in 2022
The approval for laying down new high voltage cables in Tann is now legally binding.
The Lower Bavarian government’s plan-laying resolution has now cleared the way for construction, which should begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk just announced this.
The around seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation north of the municipality with the already existing 110 kV connection between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to the mast of an overhead line near Edermanning bei Reut.
Retail is scared of the effect of the 2G rule on business around Christmas.
Most stores only allow for people who are vaccinated or recovered.
Retailers believe this to be unnecessary and are lamenting a drop in sales.
Retailers have provided a possible solution.
The 2G rule is ruining retail-essential Christmas business according to the German Trade Association (HDE).
Business with items that are not daily essentials have been suffering a drop in sales, criticizes HDE head Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of the HDE of 1100 retailors, more than 70 percent of businesses were looking pessimistically at the rest of the year.
Many have already written off Christmas sales altogether.
“What should actually be the high point of the year is now a hole without a bottom,” Genth said.
According to this, retailers with 2G entrance restrictions have lost almost a third of their pre-crises sales in the past weeks.
It is only going well for grocery sellers and online retail.
The association is demanding consequences for this dramatic development.
Purchase with masks, distance and a hygiene concept is the most secure option, said the business owner.
“2G while shopping is not getting us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he emphasized.
The current rules limit customers and require more personnel.
He requests that the armband rule be introduced on a federal level.
In that way, each customer needs to only be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and can enter all stores on that day with the armband.
Additionally, random testing should be enough in retail - as is already the case in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, spoke about the difficult Christmas business.
Most recently, the rates without 2G are at about 75 percent the pre-corona level and sales are at about 90 percent.
These numbers are sure to fall in the middle of the very important Christmas season,” said Chief Executive of “Wirtschaftswoche” Wilhelm Wellner.
Because of increased personnel and administrative overheads, there is a search going on for solutions and approvals for the centers.
The so-called armband solution is part of this search, a policy in which “the visitors bring their 2G proof to a centralized location at these centers, for example, and are then able to enter all stores with a band on their arm like at a club“. dpa
“A Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt is celebrating after a high scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the team from Hessen, which had recently lost twice in a row, seemed to be on its way to its next soccer failure.
But then the SGE turned themselves around and were able to shoot the frustration of a poor start to the season out of their soul within an hour, leading to a furious 5-2 victory. “It was crazy what the boys were able to accomplish today,” Coach Oliver Glasner said with jubilee at DAZN and spoke of “praise all around, to each and every one of them who were there”.
At the beginning, it seemed like another setback for the team from Frankfurt, who are now at place nine and still not living up to their expectations.
Patrik Schick brought the team from Leverkusen to a 2-0 lead.
What happened next deeply effected the SGE coach.
“The way the players were able to take it back and display a fantastic performance,” according to Glasner.
I am extremely happy with the performance, which we showed and also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was playing for the first time since the fourth game day and overcoming his muscle injury, really emphasized team moral.
“I think that our mentality is unbelievably great”, the 27-year-old said and was happy after checking the scoreboard, especially how it effects the viewers.
That was the party that we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner still wants to keep focused for the upcoming challenges, but sees himself well set when considering his personal situation.
It is extraordinary that all of us players are so fit in December, that we are in tip top shape.
It is pristine work by our medical department, but our players are also living extremely professionally.
Now we want to “keep going step for step and stay determined” and “execute at this same level” the challenges up until the years end.
Next on the docket is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday as part of English week.
Disappointment for women’s handball in the quarter finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women’s team slumped past with hanging heads and empty eyes after a humiliating defeat against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB cashed in on a bitter loss with 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face Spain as host in the quarter final.
“We were much too anxious and had too much respect for our opponents,” was the judgement of national team coach Henk Groener.
We need to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8-2 points in second behind Denmark (10-0).
It is a shame that we were not able to get into the flow.
That was just a bad game that we need to forget,” said team captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for semifinal placement, a significant improvement is required this coming Tuesday against the second-ranked team from 2019 in order to bring back the sweet dream of first place from 2007.
The best German scorer was defender Alina Grijseels with six goals in the duel against the three-times Olympic champion Denmark.
“We just weren’t in it - not in attack or defense,” said defender Xenia Smits, advising: “We just need to quickly turn towards the future”.
From front to back it just didn’t cut it
The German team was simply not ready to jump at the whistle like in the last five tournament games.
Missed shots, technical mistakes during attack and holes in the defense was responsible for a quick 0-4 scoreboard after seven minutes.
Only the goalie Dinah Eckerle was ready to play from the start and prevented something worse with a few saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes as Grijseels successfully shot off a quick counter attack.
This didn’t turn out to be the initial spark that was hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to get into action against the aggressive coverage of the Danes - and when it did work, it usually fell short against the mostly strong performance from Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team’s goal.
That is how the game was over early with 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially since defender Mia Zschocke was given a red card a bit later following a serious foul towards her opponent.
She will be able to play again in the quarter finals, however.
Only at the very end of the first half was the DHB team performing better in the game and reached the goal at least five times before the break.
The faint hope of an underdog recovery in the second half was already gone with a 9-19 score after seven minutes.
The Groener protégés failed in all aspects and thus made it easy for the capable opponent, who is one of the final round’s medal candidates.
After that, the German team was not able to demonstrate an increase in performance and left the court as the clear loser.
The hard “Huidlerer” question: Amberger folk know the answer
What is a “Huidlerer”?
This regionalism was sent in by someone from Amberg and became a point of serious consideration on the BR TV program “Wir in Bayern”.
In contrast to many past days, the definition was not guessed by any of the people who called in during the segment “Host mi?”.
No, it is not a “nervous person”.
Neither is it a “person who needs everything quickly”.
The people heard from the TV moderator that these were totally wrong.
The man from Amberg provided the solution to this, and thereby astonished many of the people from Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned: “A ‘Huidlerer’ is a rag with which you clean out the oven.”
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher who has been consulted as an expert for Bavarian TV for years, confirmed this.
Adding the note that this has been a typical Upper Palatinate word derived in some way from the more common regionalism “Houdern”.
Which then filled in a knowledge gap, probably even for quite a few people who had lived in the Amberg area for awhile.
Car launched into a tree: Driver is fatally wounded
The 53-year-old smashed for unknown reasons into a traffic island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then continued into incoming traffic, according to police.
That is when a front on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old occurred.
The car of the 53-year-old was then launched into a tree and the man in the car was stuck inside.
The 27-year-old and the 23-year-old both suffered heavy injuries and were brought into a nearby hospital.
