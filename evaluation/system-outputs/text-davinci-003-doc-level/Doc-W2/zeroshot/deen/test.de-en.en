The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to some extent.
Take a quick look, help out quickly, bring the bottle etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it is okay for him, that is good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It is not as if he should wrap K2 and accompany them for hours while they fall asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is also the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to actually happen such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Help me please to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken up by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with a therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The detective has a young niece who also has an anxiety (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide before each suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately forces them to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had something to do with fire.
This is the general plot, I'm fairly sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, four years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter running the entire length under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to grip.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try it.
No chance left.
Tomorrow it's off to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on one circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker with sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the DCC format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital control center.
It supports all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read on the main track with suitable control centers.
For central controllers that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
An integrated programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration to mfx®-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC braking modules or with direct current.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum automation system enables automatic shuttling between two stations.
The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railway systems.
After my voucher is no longer extended courteously due to a complaint that did not reach me, I will remove my order worth approximately

What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will drive forward a refreshment
More and more Omikron cases are worrying politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, by New Year's all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - In view of the rapidly increasing Omikron figures, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Facing the Omikron variant, there is an emergency situation, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get your booster shots now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today the invitation for a conversation arrived by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How could such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working since about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in more detail here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not seek help or think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It never gets any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
But that didn't settle after the game - but rather increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the bare result disappointed the way of appearance.
As an example, a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma can be mentioned: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with a whopping 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and did not implement what we trained".
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "Winning a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people".
Although only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they got their money's worth.
Not least also due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised even more.
While even the performance leaders in Patrick's team such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and still came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted with legal counsel again and have written to you again as a result.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Always spick and span: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists then want to make up for the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot and with enthusiasm as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair combed back tightly and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is now an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be combined with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but not flip through it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the tenancy law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or if it will come back at all?
PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Sounds great to have a coupon
Then I will redeem it myself when I place the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on the finger
That is an outrageous thing to do
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to sweep through the USA.
More than 100 deaths could be mourned in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred victims.
The storms left a 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that you have sold out of Cabinet #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you report back?
If the delivery cannot be made to my residence, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the blanket in the shopping cart and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an article via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The reworking of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German example - should also increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He changed to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I am making a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There the further action should develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Trading, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If the heroes do not notice, the goblins will ambush them in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all rendered unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. Should a defeat be unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all good.
How do you think of Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.

I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more trust in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the returns sent over, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has been decreasing more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the start delay and accident caused the schedule to be far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that, for legal reasons, Formula 1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think one should simply know such basic rules when commenting on F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time that one has to guess what is possible or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I do not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Finally, advertising simply takes over at Sky; in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Although these two channels make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel broadcasting F1.
RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, ironically, except for the commercials.
This makes the great F1 season much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For this one: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and still nothing.
The First Lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I request support.
Fan pumps are excellent for additionally supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, whole systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but fan pumps are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can start.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and be mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and set the valve in between.
This would prevent, if ever water were to flow backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything runs smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take precautions so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the logistics industry...of course, here Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate us badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, one tends to complain about these services, even though we can say at the moment,...they are having a really hard time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Can we also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the journey for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would most like to go back to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was decelerated by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space flight of Blue Origin: During the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminary retains a light color for about one minute before it gently transitions to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself all year round outdoors.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry practical behind me).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study up to the doctorate.
However, doubts are coming to me now, the career prospects are particularly depressing.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one always hears about great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other hand one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering possibly dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down.
Extra Stress Before Vacation & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm only posting now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems like there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What happened last week then?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before departure, order here order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why because?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage taking due to holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she still doesn't have any presents.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive mood by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days she still had a lot to do: "For the first time I still have no gifts, I have to finally get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage encountered in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the feather loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Modelleisenbahner ME Magazine 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been refurbished to be operational.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06, took place.
All of them survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparation goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service arose, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred for assembly first.
Only when it became apparent that the processing rate of the E 94 could not be increased any further, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway operating facility.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that the switchmen got stuck during switching operations.
Then the stoker, who was constantly travelling with this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors was a frequent occurrence, leading to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since enough new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have posed a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last to follow them was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
Their main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with play marks, cellar smell!!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't set up the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The central beam does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat with me
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House Fire with Two Minor Injuries and Significant Damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later
And I have to pay for shipping again
To debunk a Fake-News - Biontech CEO releases Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin released a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
Now the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
He shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him to do so.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that allegedly I was not vaccinated.
"In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
Şahin wrote further that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with the Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several communities were left without power due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborly help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damage would take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back in operation.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 11:15 pm, those affected by the outage would also have electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to official statements, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I cannot mount the bracket underneath on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted the one with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot slide it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Send me the return form by email?
The repair is now completed.
This is what I had already tried before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give in again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started into the track with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have already heard of some issues before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be there.
As soon as I try to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new paint to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inner side of the components that will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the layers of paint will later create an even surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names and decorative strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
It is easier to upholster an airplane cockpit before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the carrier paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check first if the picture is in the right place before you completely slide it off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I stopped reading.
On Saturday I already communicated with you.
Will I get this by email?
For all 3 packages too?
Because the lamp arrived in three separate packages for me.
Ok, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I be able to get it back without any problems?
Child Wish Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance company, they suddenly turn away.

We had applied for the children's wish train in advance with the private health insurance and received confirmation for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill them to the health insurance.
We applied again for cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted another 3 attempts.
After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are settled with the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The Reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
Questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
* Did the private health insurance have to inform us in the promises that the remaining attempts would expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We won't order anything else from you.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You can certainly pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the cabinet arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clearly stated that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly a low-budget film is.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture produced with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what don't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With kind regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" Against Belarus Comes at High Cost for EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This state of suspension - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"It apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempted Border Crossing Again
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
The spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border during the night of Sunday.
According to the reports, Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
It is reported that a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is believed by Mercedes to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach of regulations by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I am checking this.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white through the jerseys on this day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or the like.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake to fix, not all of us from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with you every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a god started it all.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz community are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations at the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
He says that makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any discussions here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
A possible equivalent in English might be something like the "twister", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and was using Devolo DLan, which was working perfectly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit with only a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module, which broadcasts the wifi, the full 500 do not arrive, but the further away I am in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more grateful for an answer.
When it's time to switch bank accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with bank accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the negative interest rate allowances are also continuing to decrease.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for day money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, especially among cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less according to figures of the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly create provisions - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
Nevertheless, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
That her hearts of female and male fans still flock to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And has crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
This hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame bring happiness.
Dignified End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Give Up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach, who was fourth in the first race, ended up in eighth place.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple victory.
Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen, two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion, came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
"It was super cool for me, my first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me along."
I am very happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
It didn't say anything about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I type on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe it's the same for some others...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child 1 to 1.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also suffering from a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is causing me difficulty with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having a stomachache right now, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we of course have to divide up.
But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am somewhat well treated and I am managing.
Not good, but I am managing and I am almost symptom free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I should at least prepare something for the anatomy lesson.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams otherwise.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Furthermore, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this was always strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well.
That's been a long time, then I would advise against it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and a story unfolds.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself, I believe.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping only on her belly since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take much more than you think.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly toys, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it prop itself up from the stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I kindly request you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel trying to bring its BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make money from the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling – My little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odors, mildew or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the cover beforehand!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (fire and burning hazard!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Once the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt Second after First Half - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt even under the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
Error, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
In response, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the network?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour but still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, remain well organized and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior thanks to practical accesses.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design has it figuratively speaking - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This can be done in two ways: first, conventionally through the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more about this below) and thus store both separately and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support. 
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the order.
Announcement from the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I have now been writing to the third support staff, with none of them I have gone further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cupboard could be delivered again?
Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help.
I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year did not turn out as expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But I, as a customer, do not accept the damage.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer, searching for wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the corresponding locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock-out!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
Once all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the announcer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW Psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible adults should never, ever, ever seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom to develop and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation that is meaningful and possible.
I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States Discussing Abolishment of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolishment of the testing requirement for fully vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference already on Tuesday next week". − afp

What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex had** per definition **no awareness.
I read their comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is also standard in the eCommerce sector in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose some money.
I already sent you an email which you did not answer.
Once again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is this so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had asked a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at 97
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an Intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give thanks for my life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardized wooden pallet used mainly in the European area as a cargo carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins first MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have gotten a taste for it and I would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef stock for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
Until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check on that?
Where in Lübeck there is still Christmas roast
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have you not gotten poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier plays a major role in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
This characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even make a power reserve available if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when making direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX socket so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there then a way to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending more than 1,000 euros on goods that I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Iranian officials say progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," as there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated at first.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overtakes Saxony - Free State Now Has Highest Corona Incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day rate at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence in Germany, this rate was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There can be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
It might be possible until then, since the delivery is only in early March.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it?
Do I have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
I want to avoid this, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, 8 euros for return shipping is an outrage.
It is time for change
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: It is non-existent.
We have fallen into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer lull for a few months.

Yes, what was the cause?
Most likely it is simply related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a desire for the German Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
* How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How can we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord for that at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be collected in good time.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as far as possible for the collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
In response to the question of whether I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I had long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering could be reduced.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it.
Greetings from a peace-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, this cannot be changed as I am unable to be present due to a funeral.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From February 1st #NUMBER# I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue Ready: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle Water Rescue of the Volunteer Fire Department Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that the number of deployments will continue to rise: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river are contributing to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but after synchronizing, removing and reloading the app, NOTHING worked.
I am quite frustrated because this whole process has already taken me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix Lab at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values may vary depending on the flashlight used, age and environment.
1) The burning duration in the Bright stage includes the burning duration with reduced brightness due to overheating protection.
2) Dealers are responsible for customers.
Customers should contact the retailers or distributors from which they purchased Fenix lights with Fenixlight Limited's 'Warranty Card' and either a sales invoice or a receipt for warranty support.
Fenix will provide our authorized retailers with the technology and parts necessary for the maintenance of our lights.
1) 15-day free replacement: Fenix will replace a new product within 15 days of purchase due to any manufacturing defects if any problems arise with normal use.
We will replace it with the same model.
Once the model has been set, customers will receive a product with a similar or improved model.

Any defects or damages caused by other behaviors cannot be adequately controlled by Fenix.
6) To make a claim under the warranty, please contact our warranty department with the following information: Name, type/model of the warranty object, serial number.
Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also weapon carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Generally, it should be said that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that of course, in particular, uniforms and weapons carriers attract people to the right of conservative magically, and that these people can then of course have difficulty dealing with the lived reality is also clear, because in addition to the average white, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because these are rather rare in the executive or not at all, but quite normal men and women who do not show it if they do not tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these marginalized groups, although it sounds strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them or tries to do them right, while they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that these are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined, in my opinion, that we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order which is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany as well?
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
Regular through Child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am independent, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything is left behind, and then and then I get motivated and tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never like "someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually housework just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with children?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I don't have any motivation, it doesn't bother me that much as long as no visitors come and for example there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with children or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch area ensure a close, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face on the hood increases comfort, sealability and durability (separate hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Langer G-Lock P Back Zip (Overall without Hood) with Metal Slider and Integrated Water Dam System for Improved Sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on Arms and Legs
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels adhered flush with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for increased durability
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in Social Work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have done a training in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS already causes problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it pulls me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm mentally handicapped" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment
What do you mean by returning please?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book" appears.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cupboard.
The bird breaks down the protein taken in with the food in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and builds its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the renewal of feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
At the beginning of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is served until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse us, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a Community Worker in Opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
A felling application has also been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the ordinance.
However, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious Traffic Accident near Selb
A serious traffic accident recently occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03 hrs), a car has gone into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Good, then thank you again for making it so easy!

Happy Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally I studied something else and worked in a field there (to stay at least a bit anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and I was sure that was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the reference, after which I can always switch.
But right now I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the exam I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time then.
And the stress at work was irrelevant at the moment.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is running well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, even though the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter as is usually the case now.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't be back at the same place as now and be unhappy.
You can see that everything is somehow confused, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, where I'm completely finished and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your opinions can help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation is at least a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has constantly evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these are simply better at getting the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to your photo equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and an attached flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Furthermore, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares have been covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new peninsulas of a total size of about 50 hectares were formed off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in some way on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving arose the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they reject the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus creating a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve as a result.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the tradition of Saint Nicholas is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin procession.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all countries influenced by Christianity, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white fluffy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was stopped by officers shortly afterwards.
It was reported that shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
- The robust plastic version is suitable for use outdoors all year round.
- In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless, however: The sun alone ensures that this solar lamp fascinates with its light - either in white or in colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: As a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is durable and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; what color it will be is up to you: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Finally, the light will turn off automatically when the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or when it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if my voucher is not taken into account, then I will not order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation especially with bell-armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides enough power even for older motors with up to 1.5A motor current.

Pill Problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
To my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne all over my body during my last two-year break from 0 to 100.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel good.
In the two year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my gynecologist didn't take me so seriously and I still have an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
I have also tried all kinds of nutrition in the course of chronic illness and have stayed with a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It may also be the case that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else might be wrong.
I had already written everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
Now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong
But is it generally available in large sizes?
Since it is available in black in large sizes.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments
In the courtroom they sit in everyday clothing on the bench.
Much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them talk to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.

110-kV Underground Cable to be Newly Constructed in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The approval decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived with us in parts so far.
The blue parcel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass cabinet and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the same for all books, which is why the request was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been at the Ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I currently have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the school book and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of Geofactors and for me each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I usually start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) when planning and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am not very satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
Trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales declines.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retail stores, according to the German Trade Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there are declines in sales for stores selling non-daily items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to him, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G when shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel expenditure.
He demanded that the wristband regulation be approved nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer only needs to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, the revenues at around 90 percent.
"These numbers will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame that was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and it's done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality arises from the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won twice in a row, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it up, shot their frustration over a mediocre season start off their shoulders within an hour and won brilliantly with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which is still in ninth place and not meeting expectations.
Patrik Schick put Leverkusen 2-0 in the lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well prepared in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level until the end of the year".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 pm, Sky) already on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I will receive an email informing me that my package is returning to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# to have it redirected, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampener for Women's Handball before Quarter-Final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danish women (10:0).
It is a shame that we could not take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to back not up to par
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark from the start.
Errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke soon afterwards also saw red due to a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be able to participate in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get into the game a bit better and at least come within five goals by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener-Schützlinge sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as a clear loser.

Do you want to pass your traditions on to your children as well?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
Polishing boots?
Baking cookies?
Decorating with trees?
Will music be played?
Does Santa come, the Christ Child or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to have it as nice as possible as a family.

Can you do that?
The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, it will continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medication X, does that go with the vaccination..").
My tasks include informing about the vaccination, making the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and has no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any of them, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Difficult "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed in the series "Host mi?" this time by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And not one "who needs everything to go quickly".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then provided the solution, which probably caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirming, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Selection of tires for racing bike - really so puncture-proof?
Today morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training to prepare for my bike tour next week.
I said, done, and I took off with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what usually lurks in every city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinter on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire absolutely refused to continue the rest of the track.
Since I had no real possibility to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad mood-wise, maybe it's even better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I am facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really not like to have this problem again and again.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change the tire after 80-90kms, then I'm probably really grumpy :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the racing bike right now.
They do exist (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and looks optically similar to the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is particularly suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it performs remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common with widebanders to optimize the strongly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outward, the treble range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, one wants to veneer the housing, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds additional material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later without any problems.
Using an overhead router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Then, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), one begins with the laying of the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
For this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leave it hanging out there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and also leave it hanging out loosely there.
The crossover is prepared and installed below.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With some skill, hot glue can be dropped onto the opening through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and thus sealed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be present via connection, so we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Start chilling drinks, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
