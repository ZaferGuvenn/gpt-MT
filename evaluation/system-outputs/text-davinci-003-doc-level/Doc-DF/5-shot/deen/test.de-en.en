The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder at the better price or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a quick look, help out for a bit, bring the bottle, etc.
This way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can entertain himself for a short time and it's OK for him, that's great.
You can best judge whether it's right for your children.
It's not like he should be changing diapers and accompanying them for hours while they fall asleep.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
For if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female police officer who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The police officer has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
More suicides follow and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide before each suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that has something to do with fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is familiar to anyone or if someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I'll have to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?

What am I supposed to do with this number then??
Johnson to Push for Boosters Due to Omikron
Increasing cases of Omikron are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster on coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said they were facing an emergency due to the Omikron variant, and that protection must be strengthened urgently.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get your booster now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
**I am a foreigner and don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them are going.
Only the one I bought today is not going.
Obviously, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How could such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
I first tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that hasn't been working for about 
14 days now.
So I've been buying the last books through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.

Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to my profession.
One issue that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't let themselves be helped or think we can't help them.
I am well aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the Series About "League of Legends" Like?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, and an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg’s Derby Debacle at Merlins Crailsheim
At least young Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
But after the game, that didn't settle - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What more than the bare result disappointed was the way of the performance.
As an example, a statistic can be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained".
Namely to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least thanks to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While even the performance leaders in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and still come within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
The Giants already receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 p.m.), in front of then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted with legal counsel and have written to them again.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always Dapper: Max Raabe Turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be missed from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It could be matched with existing furniture and that way we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No New Apartments Created Through Expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No single new apartment is created through expropriation, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.

This is an absolute outrage
At Least 100 Dead from Tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, claiming up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is there a possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my residence, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the carpet and have it shipped to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article through the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies Pay Vaccination Bonuses and Change Advertising Slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company he was badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with First Campaign
Greetings Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition them into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumbling over my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That is where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, negotiate, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow and flank the wagon with bows to the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions:
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village headman, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play an important role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm definitely going to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
So I would still like to send it back.
Can you then send the return slips, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm Frustrated with Sky Sport F1
Hello fellow F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky broadcast has been steadily declining throughout the season, so I'm making this post to vent a bit.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start crash put the schedule far behind schedule, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It seems that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Still a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think that these basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time that one has to guess what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's artificial comment style, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But honestly, I even prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, as only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So, this great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Order Here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and still nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already developed a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am requesting assistance.
Air pumps are an excellent way to supplement an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air pumps.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
At the end of the offer, take a look at the table.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Air pumps are also suitable for setting accents in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can start.
The fan pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing back if water were to flow back from the tank through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to be proactive so that no one gets upset just because it takes a bit longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the freight industry...of course here, Corona doesn't stop.
Please don't rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it really tough.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon Founder Bezos Sends Astronaut Daughter and Host into Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.
The launch and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the freshly minted astronauts back upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were away for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket was not disclosed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced about her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his missions.
She just went along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back to space right away, the host said.
"New Shepard" Flies Up to 100 Kilometers High
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object was decelerated by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space outing from Blue Origin: Bezos himself was on board for the first in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, famous for his role as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek”, was present, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin’s Deputy Chief, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminescent stone will keep one light color for about one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative hue.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself year-round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, its light looks even better – only with shortened luminosity should be expected when the days are shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can get a matching replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the use of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also researched job prospects before I started studying, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely want to study up to a PhD.
But now I have doubts, especially the job prospects are depressing me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear about great job opportunities and the profession is in high demand, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really unsure and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences with that, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Vacation & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up last week for me.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
So only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It seems like there is also stress before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in our Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend.
So what was going on last week?
Stress Everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the drive, one order here, one order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds too long and that can't be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage taking because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent like that.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is Looking Forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland – but she doesn’t have any presents yet.
“The nice thing is, even if there’s no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,” the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
“I love it,” said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: “For the first time I don’t have any presents yet, I really have to get started now.”
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is due to nutritional errors.
As the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is essential for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the Central German network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred.
Only when it became clear that the number of refurbishments of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus of the refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
In 1960 they came to the Halle P railway depot.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
It happened often that switches stuck during switching operations.
Then the assistant who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to loosen the switches with a hammer and a wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of outages of the locomotive.
[5] By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and no plans for a significant expansion of electric operations, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, resigned on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn officials to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completely completed.
The locomotive is maintained in a museum-like manner at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable due to their low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were rehomed to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, some optical work on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of play, basement smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held up by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The center beam is held up by two feet, which unfortunately were produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the designated holder.
So I will get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, not flat.
Those are the right ones in shape, according to the assembly instructions, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
Mine are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House Fire with Two Minor Injuries and High Damage
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
It will arrive much later then
And I have to pay for shipping again
To Counter Fake News - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
My school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust," he added.
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Legally, I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccinating the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in Substation: Tens of Thousands Without Power
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia went dark: no power and in many cases, no heating either.
A fire had shut down a substation.
After a fire caused serious damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without power for around 24 hours.
The fire left 41,000 residents in several communities without power on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare in schools and called for neighborly help.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as Westnetz technicians were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power Flowing Again
The fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 pm, those who were still affected by the power outage would have electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the bracket on the tabletop.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to concede defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
As soon as I try to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupted, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts that will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers will later provide an even surface.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An airplane cockpit is easier to stick before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water-slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the carrier paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you slide the image just a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away to the side.
Attention: Always check first if the image is in the right place before you slide it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suck up any excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I read up to.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
For all 3 packages too?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me
Still, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a “Insurance Case”?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time now, and now that it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing.
To explain:
We had applied for fertility treatment with the private health insurance in advance and were granted approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill them to the private health insurance.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the private health insurance and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones to the private health insurance) we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The Reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
But according to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the room here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the promises that the further attempts would expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three options by email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We won't be ordering anything else from them.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you've obviously lost good customers.
You can feel free to pass that on to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't be blamed for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clearly stated that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but we can't find them on your website.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film is not an exact science with set budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about them?
And what don’t you like about them?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
Best regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" Against Belarus Comes at High Cost for EU
EU can declare a “half victory” in its conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the cost is very high and means massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) said.
This state of limbo – Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like a winner – will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
There appears to be an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion of the Union.
“It apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing,” as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the Belarus border, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt to Cross the Border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and taken back to the border on Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard fists and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests Controversial Formula 1 Finale
Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has lodged a protest after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'm checking on that.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thanks for the support.
Free Admission for Members: Europa-Park Hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, the namesake of the SC Freiburg’s Europa-Park Stadium, has invited to an SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announced, members and season ticket holders of the SC Freiburg from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
On this day, the roller coaster cars were lit up in the team’s red and white jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing happy fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann Read from Her Novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I haven't received any email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake to fix, not everyone in our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with you every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
I would like to deliver the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
Admit it, neither of them do.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as untrustworthy as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is just completely lost.
For me, a god started it all.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz Municipality Choose the Christmas Trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some strange situations at the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has experienced some strange situations.
He says that makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny.
And what about the coupon??
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I'm paying the full price for it.
Then I'll rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a debate here about which is the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and was using Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox receives them.
However, at the other DLan module, which broadcasts the wifi, not the full 500 arrive, but the further away I am from the module in the house (i.e. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less arrives.
This means that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That's why I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When It's Time to Switch Checking Accounts
Those who thought the checking account drama was over were wrong.
While many banks used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the negative interest rate thresholds are continuing to drop.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now they have just halved the threshold and even quartered it for day money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day money accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the thresholds in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Still, more than 100 banks have now set a threshold of 25,000 euros or less, according to the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer protection organizations, which in the first instance were successful in the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher courts declare negative interest rates to be generally inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston Employs an Entire Beauty Army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of female and male fans still flock to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame make her happy too.
An Undignified End to a Career: Raikkonen Forced to Retire
Kimi Raikkonen’s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the barriers, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” ends his career in the motorsport’s premier class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen’s greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and made it to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, moving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who races for Stuttgart, came in fifth after placing second before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it too," Lochner said.
Nolte with Home Win - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory in the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
"It was super cool for me, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm really happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now they said it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's the same for some of you...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having stomach pain right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to do homework, which we obviously have to divide up.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently well-controlled, I'm somewhat well-treated and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I'm getting by and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I should at least prepare a bit for anatomy class.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes like this: Just until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on, right?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors, because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think this has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.#NUMBER#
Moreover, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed it.
What do you think about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
Hope my question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, then I would advise against it.
Good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help with Movie Search
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand the modern (real world).
On the other hand the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a story develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to be able to live himself, I think.
The transition is also, I believe, the soldier's tomb.
At the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Kids can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything else is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often but don't do minute surveillance.
That will drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, always a blanket.
Take a look at your child when they are sleeping.
Do they turn their head to the side?
Can they lift themselves up from their stomach?
Or do they lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can tell if everything is okay from that.
We all grew up too, and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR then?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the politics of this channel are now below par.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" internet channel.
Quote Arno: You want to be "no running billboard".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make money off the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

My Little Heat Friend is versatile - whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb and dose heat very well.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they don't feel well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable for the following areas of application exclusively as a heat pad:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, mold or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave!)
Immediately after heating, shake the heat evenly throughout the pillow!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which will disappear with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the indicated warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before warming the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow in case of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds as well as persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to exclude overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt Second After First Half - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf

Is the Battery Dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power adapter.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power adapter alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up despite the power adapter being plugged in.
So I took out the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have some ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on power?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still need to bring a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday life, stays well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various “filling levels”: there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This allows the backpack to be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: in addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional top-loading backpacks - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: if you are taking not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This also allows you to pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you are heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# promised me an email yesterday confirming 
the contact with the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing to the third support staff, none of whom have gone beyond the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cupboard could be delivered again?
Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
Have a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year did not go as planned, I could not have foreseen and did not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River spotted glimmering chunks in the water.
Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a piece of the land’s wealth.
For many, it was “Coloma or Bust”!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth and fame in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding riverways and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets locked down!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter moves to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped in foil) up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually DPD insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send cardboard in cardboard for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are no pressure points 100%.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom to develop and make the framework for the child as big as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries Discuss Abolishing Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for those who are fully vaccinated.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who are fully vaccinated," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for those who are fully vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on Tuesday next week". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to go about it?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchasing through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer works.
I have updated my account information.
What could be causing this?
What you describe is referred to as “Awareness”, or sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this involves hearing sounds/voices, less often seeing images, and most rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, however u/Nitemarex did not have any** **per definition.
I read their comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you didn't answer.
Asking again.
The order and invoice say that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had a question.
Theater Historian Günther Rühle Dies at 97
He distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an Intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify my life's thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York Wins MLS Championship for the First Time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
It was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I'm getting into the swing of things and I want to make rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I'm going to make a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What's next?
What about the books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I can manage that.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check that.
Where to Get Christmas Roast in the Lübeck Area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't gotten poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp plays a major role in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
This characteristic is perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even make a reserve of power available if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an extremely "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there then a way to return the lamp?
Since it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send it back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
But more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I just received my shipment and was wondering if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That's not a satisfactory answer and the wait wasn't worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Deal
Iranian officials say progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," he said, as there had not even been agreement on the topics to be negotiated at first.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed on Thursday after a nearly week-long break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overtakes Saxony - Free State Now Has Highest Corona Incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
It is the only state with a value above 1000.
Thuringia was the only state in Germany to have an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
There can be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only due in early March, it might be possible by then.
I just need to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/fill out/specify anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense.
8 euros for return shipping is a cheek in my opinion.
It's Time for Change
#Greetings from the Bundestag, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the point of this post?
If you look at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, one thing is clear: it's non-existent.
We have fallen into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, it should simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many here still have a real passion for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a shambles.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are willing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have the Discord for that.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# day blanket, is it also available in oversized, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be picked up in good time.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an assembly guide?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like very much.
She herself had lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had also been a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I had long thought that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it.
Greetings from a peace-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, this cannot be changed as I am unable to be present due to a funeral.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again continuously.
Lahnstein Wehr Ready for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new Water Rescue Vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that the number of missions will continue to rise: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations but synced, removed and re-downloaded the app, NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole process has already taken me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
In general, however, it should be said that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course people with a right-wing inclination are magically attracted to special uniforms and armed officers should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course have difficulty dealing with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have next to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because these are rather less to none in the executive, but rather normal men and women who do not show it if they do not tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these marginal groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less taken up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposedly fighting for them or trying to do them right, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, that these people are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who are often on foreign missions, often start to generalize due to negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are, in my opinion, well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
More Orderly Through a Child?
Hi, I (w32) have been thinking about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "so that someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, I'm somewhere bothered by it but usually the household just loses against work and disinclination.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me I don't have any incentive, I just don't care that much, as long as there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with children or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut, provides maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arms and knees)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch area ensure a close, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft collar zone improves seal with fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle hook and loop closure which does not adhere to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and leg joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs hemmed for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in Social Work - As Someone With An Insecure Personality Disorder?
I have done a training in software development and have now been out of school for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In short, this means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think this has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family aid.
But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPD already leads to problems (for me, emotionally) in my job, because it pulls me down every time there is something to be said about my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm mentally handicapped" etc.).
I'm probably going to have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a pickup appointment
What do you mean by returning please!
When I downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, I got the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book".
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these in turn its own protein substances are built up, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the breeding cycle.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.




1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level scoop (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the start until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose should be given until the new feather growth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
I'm sorry, but this chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a Community Worker in Opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So an application for felling was made to the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?

Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought of.
Before I start here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up with teaching and was sure that this is it - even if the conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past I always decided to keep going and at least finish the thesis, after that I can always switch.
But right now I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the thesis I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time then.
And the stress at work didn't matter at the time.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the thesis is also going well, as far as feedback and so on is concerned.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter as is usually the case now.
But then I wonder if I'm not back in the same place a year from now and unhappy.
You can see that it's all kind of confused, but maybe you have advice or ideas as outsiders to get me out of this situation, that I'm completely done and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the weepy tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also of course contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp is the key to a tube amp’s character and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 Points from Wagner, Magic Lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic’s losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop dividers, it can be tailored to your photo equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera – from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
One possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash.
Larger DSLMs such as the various Sony a7 models or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
Plus, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for both your equipment and non-photo items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic Eruption on La Palma: Probably Longest in History
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
At 85 days long, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, at 84 days.
No reliable data is available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a forecast as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the Millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava hotter than 1000 degrees Celsius has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That’s almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new peninsulas with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important to the island and from which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly hard hit.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "societal contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of the saints".
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nikolaus into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it only annoys a few that the custom of Saint Nikolaus, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries there is a cheerful muddle over the question of who brings the children the gifts.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.
I have been getting this error message for the past 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date:
Please help me troubleshoot this, as I 
will otherwise have to purchase a different e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one would be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the spam folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police Shoot Suspected Bank Robber Near King’s Palace
A armed man was shot by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookmaker’s shop.
The man, according to authorities, fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
Police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I'm immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
Quite harmless, however, is "Smart Stone": It is solely the sun that ensures that this solar light fascinates with its light - either in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-free, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar lamp.
Place the "luminous stone" in any place that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide a secure hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging as soon as sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you decide what color: in addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it has become light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher isn't credited, then I won't order out of principle.

No hardware store was open anyway during the lockdown....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation, especially with bell-armature motors – the typical “humming” belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique “Autotune” function allows the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to stop taking it again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
When I last had a two-year break, I got pimples from 0 to 100 explosively and everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed on me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to make an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read this novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
I had severe eczema before puberty, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular eczema and the acne issue.
I also tried all kinds of things in terms of nutrition due to a chronic illness and I stayed with a mix of low sugar, low milk and low meat because nothing else really worked.
It may also be that hormones are simply the worm in it, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else is wrong.
I had already written everything to your colleague Semina, etc.
And now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong
but is it generally available in large sizes
since it is available in large sizes in black

In the Name of the People: Laypeople Pass Judgments
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge’s bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don’t wear a robe: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them talk to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the means to store it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
I had already ordered and received the same chair in blue in November, so because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
and when would the pickup be?
110-kV Underground Cable to be Rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria’s plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass cabinet and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The cabinet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the cabinet cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, which is why the inquiry was made at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (Geography)
Hello colleagues,
I've been in Ref since summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technologically, so I can basically only use the board, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a lot of time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and for me, each lesson stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm not very satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Trade Fears Christmas Business Due to 2G Regulation
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed into most stores.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the German Trade Association (HDE) in the opinion of the trade association.

More than 70 percent of the companies surveyed by the HDE among 1,100 retailers had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is often now a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to the HDE, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Retail and online are the only areas doing well.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a lot of personnel.
The bracelet regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet received.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at around 90 percent.
"These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame that has been attempted to be camouflaged with yellow filler.
It looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree radiation angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively short distances, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
At the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Also located there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with Battery One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly attach it to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Torrid Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had been winless in their last two series, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it up, scored their frustration over a patchy start to the season in a good hour and won 5-2 in a spectacular manner. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "blanket praise to each and every one who was involved".
At first it looked like another setback for the Frankfurters, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 in the lead.
What happened then impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go step by step and stay modest" and "pull through the tasks until the turn of the year at this level".
Next up is already an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 pm, Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
What grade will I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part?
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# to have it redirected, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would mean for me that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's women's handball team walked off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To finish off the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to show up differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement is needed against the 2019 World Championship runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Off the Pace from Front to Back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can participate in the quarter-finals again.
It was only in the closing stages of the first half that the DHB selection got into the game a bit better and at least came within five goals by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, Groener's charges sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final tournament.
In the following, the German team could not muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

Can you do that?
The title gives it away, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these are soon finished for the most part, it will continue for me partly in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medication X, does that go with the vaccination..").
My tasks include informing about the vaccination, making an indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and has no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any of them, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough “Huidlerer” Question: Amberger Knows the Answer
What on earth is a “Huidlerer”?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused some serious head-scratching on the BR television show “Wir in Bayern”.
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unguessed by the callers in the “Host mi?” series.
No, it was not a “person who is nervous”.
Nor was it someone “who needs everything to happen quickly”.
That, the TV presenter told the people, was completely wrong.
At which point the man from Amberg gave the answer, probably causing surprise among many Upper Palatines.
“The Huidlerer”, the viewers learned, “is a rag used to wipe out the oven”.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
Noting that this was a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word “Houdern”.
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, I always get the following error message: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have reset, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Choosing Tires for a Road Bike - Really That Puncture-Proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I went out with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to do the rest of the route at all.
Since I had no real possibility to get replacement casing and replacement tube due to the weekday, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad mood-wise, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to get this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike had ridden 120km until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
But when I think about having to change the tire after 80-90kms, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ / tire now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have on the racing bike I think 25x622.
These are also available (apparently?) With the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?

Car Skids into Tree: Driver Fatally Injured
The 53-year-old had, for unknown reasons, crashed into a median strip on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to police.
There, he had a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then skidded into a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and optically reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a matching foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the conditions at home in length.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tonally tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with widebands to optimize the strongly increasing bundle of too high frequencies.
Precisely aimed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the treble range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan for corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using an upper milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are then glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can be varied in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, ie the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal block on the rear wall.
Then use a round router to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The footplate is then glued firmly to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blowing out), one begins with the laying of the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Here one pushes the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it there about 30 cm out.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and also left hanging loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With a bit of skill, hot glue can be dropped onto the opening through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and thus closed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello everyone,
> We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be joining us remotely, so we will be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We are doing our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic times - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Start chilling your drinks, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
