The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to some extent.
Just take a quick look, help out for a bit, bring the bottle etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can entertain himself for a short time and it's OK for him, that's great.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he should change diapers and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female police officer who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats fear patients.
The police officer has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
More suicides occur and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is familiar to someone or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the wifi available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that could take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter running the entire length under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grip.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on one circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker with sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register at a suitable digital control center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable control centers.
For control centers that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC shuttle automation allows for automatic shuttling between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct current and alternating current tracks.

Due to Omikron: Johnson will push for booster vaccinations
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of the rapidly increasing Omikron figures than previously planned.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omikron variant, an emergency situation is facing us, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third vaccination.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
**I am a foreigner and don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today does not go.
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How else could such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
I first tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that hasn't been working for about 
14 days now.
So I have been buying the last books always through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.

Content Warning: I will be writing something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation between four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" worth?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg's Derby Debacle at Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said about the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
But after the game that didn't calm down - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
But more than the bare result, the way of the performance disappointed.
By way of example, a statistic should be mentioned which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained".
Namely to move the ball.
Completely different was the reaction of his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time", said the happy coach.
"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While even the performance leaders in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and still came within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
The Giants already receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 p.m.), also in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have consulted with a lawyer again and have written to them again because of this.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always perfectly dressed: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season also have to be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for the dates postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot and liked to sing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be missed from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It needs to be matched with existing furniture and that way we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but not flip through it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartments created through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No single new apartment is created through expropriation, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be in stock again?
Or if it will ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great
Then I will redeem it myself with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I already cut my finger
That's absolutely outrageous.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to pass through the US.
It is feared that more than 100 people may have died in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the US and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
After visiting the disaster area, Governor Andy Beshear said that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is expecting up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That's very unfortunate.
Will it still be produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I returned an item via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He changed to a company he was badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That's where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, trade, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If the heroes do not notice, the goblins will ambush them in a hollow path and flank the wagon with bows armed to the left and right with three each, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions:
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play an important role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more trust in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together again.
Unfortunately it still doesn't work.
So I would still like to send it back.
Can you then send the return slips, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing more and more over the season, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the start delay and the start accident put the schedule far behind the plan, they could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Still a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1 again, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time that one has to guess what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, as only the German audio track has to do without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sports F1 program is also very meager and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising.
So, in any case, the great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For this one: #PRS_ORG# Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and still nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Air pumps are excellent for additionally supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, air pumps are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration, which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can start.
The fan pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing back through the pump if water were to flow back from the tank...
If the fan pump is mounted outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are real powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to be proactive so that no one gets upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please don't rate it badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the door to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his missions.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space trip from Blue Origin: Bezos himself was on board for the first in July, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was there, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy chief, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently light up in one color or play through its entire color range.
Set to color change, the luminescent stone retains a light color for about one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself all year round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, its light looks even better - only with shortened luminosity is to be expected when the days are shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can get a matching replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the use of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I actually find the subject quite exciting and I don't mind standing in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely study up to the doctorate and will.
But now I have doubts, especially the career prospects depress me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) you always hear great job opportunities and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I'm currently really uncertain and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences with that, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress before Holiday & Weekend Holidays
This topic came up last week with me.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that there is also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend.
So what was going on last week?
Everywhere stress.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the weekend, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week" sounds like too much time and that can't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve so much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage taking because of holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The nice thing is, even if it doesn't snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive mood by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do until the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage encountered in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via the drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparation goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the need for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were preferred.
Only when it became clear that the refurbishment number of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus of the refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway operating workshop.
They came to the Halle P railway operating workshop in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that switches stuck during switching operations.
Then the assistant who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to loosen the switch with a hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of outages of the locomotive.
[5] Since enough new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have been a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, resigned on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with play marks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the provided holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later then.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin released a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had motivated him, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he had rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can only be fought with facts with difficulty, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities lost power on Friday evening.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborly help.
The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as Westnetz technicians were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9:30 p.m.
Since 23.15 o'clock also the last ones affected by the failure would have electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood help.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
According to the authorities, temporary care places were also set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the bracket on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We got one with a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot slide it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return slip by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We are not in agreement with this.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give in again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead into the track after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and use version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
As soon as I try to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
In order for the paint job to be even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or transfers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An airplane cockpit can be easier to stick before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back of them with water until the carrier paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you only slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check first whether the picture is in the right place before you slide it completely away from the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I read up to.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me.
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it suddenly refuses.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later we tried to get a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill them to the private health insurance.
We applied again for the cost coverage with the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts.
After some more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically we bill the most expensive ones to the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second wish for a child is a new insurance case.
However, according to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer any need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
* Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the acceptances that the further attempts would expire with a birth?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three options by email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We won't be ordering anything else from you.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You can feel free to pass that on to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the item back first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote.
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What do you find attractive about it?
And what don't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
Best regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This state of suspension - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decide to oppose this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently it cannot prevail if a member state sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the Belarus border, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt to Cross the Border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested and taken back to the border in the night of Sunday.
According to the information, the Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard fists and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an objection.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'm checking on that.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thanks for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white jerseys on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day in Europa-Park, it has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing happy fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the nightly noises at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for the return of an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or the like.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake to fix and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with you every day.
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
I would like to deliver the package to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
Admitting it, neither of them will.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
For my part, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to exactly specified conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflection coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz are selecting the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations at the fir sale.
Once a man is said to have even gone home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That makes the pre-Christmas season always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module, which transmits the wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the less I move away from the module in the house (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here specially.
So I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Whoever thought that there would be peace with current accounts now is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to fall.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the threshold and even quartered it for overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight money accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the thresholds in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers there, which in the first instance were granted this regulation by the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly create reserves - in case the higher courts declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life resembles a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of female and male fans still flock to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame make her happy too.
Dignified End of a Career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship 2007 in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he moved from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who races for Stuttgart, came fifth after second place before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory in the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third with Leonie Fiebig.
"It was super cool for me, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm really happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it's currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
It was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot that I just want to write and maybe it's the same for some of you...
I'm 24, have PTSD, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have homework coming up, which we of course have to divide up.
But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently well regulated, I'm halfway well treated and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I'm getting by and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Just until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on afterwards?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening anyway, the week is almost done!
I got my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Moreover, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Completely different: I noticed in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
What do you think about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well.
That's been a long time, then I would refrain from it.
That's great, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand the modern (real world).
On the other hand the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a plot develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to be able to live himself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take much more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up a bit from its stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from this whether everything is in order.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived two days ago (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this station is now below all standards.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" internet station.
Quote Arno: One wanted to be "no running billboard".
What is it now?
A 0815 advertising station that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make money from the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy ache or just for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odors, mold or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave!)
Immediately after heating, shake the heat evenly throughout the pillow!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before warming the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, bruises and open wounds as well as people with reduced pain sensitivity.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are leaking, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat area is.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, it remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it proverbially - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This allows the backpack to be securely closed without having to engage the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This also allows you to pull the backpack from the right side towards the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you are heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# promised me an email yesterday confirming the 
contact with the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It is foreseeable when the cupboard could be delivered again?

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year went differently than expected I could not anticipate and could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

Additional openings created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car with attractive and striking looks.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of metal in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You all choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, covering each location once and ending the year.
There is a shootout where the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is taken.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary has just appeared in my Twitter timeline, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked off a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom to develop and make the framework for the child as big as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: States discuss the abolition of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to be vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) had promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday next week". − afp
So I want to return the lamp
What is the best way to go about it?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.

Purchases through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer are possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often in seeing images, and most rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, but** u/Nitemarex **did not have it per definition.
I read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you didn't answer.
Asking again.
The order and invoice say that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is the company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at 97 years old
He distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify here my life's thanks".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with 4-2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I'm in the mood and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will make a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier is a major contributor to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
This feature is perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even make a reserve of power available if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on and off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen this with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send it back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update in the next few weeks for the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit too much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
Iranian officials say progress is being made in negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed on Thursday after a nearly week-long break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting at weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense.
8 euros for return postage is a cheek in my eyes.
It is time for change.
#MBundestag greetings to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the post here for?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one thing can be said: it is non-existent.
We have come into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer hole for some months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, it should simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been done here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has been increasingly shown that many here really still have a desire for the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and, simply put, found a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are willing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For that I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# bedspread, is it also available in oversized, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# should be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that one could reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "crude"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan you quickly get put in a corner and conflicts arise without you intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot change this as I have to attend a funeral.
Can you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
I will be available again from 01.02.#NUMBER#.
Lahnstein Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant decision for 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle water rescue of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein in the Lahnstein town hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanently increasing deployments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's it then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar job, that is, we were also armed carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course, especially uniform and weapon carriers, people to the right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course have difficulty dealing with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have next to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because these are rather less to none in the executive, but quite normal men and women whom one does not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or put it in for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposedly fighting for them or trying to do them right, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, that these are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are, in my opinion, well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled that it is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
I'm still talking about my order that is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
More orderly with a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have been more or less able to keep my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and then and then I get it and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "so that someone could come spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, I'm somewhere disturbed but mostly the household just loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no one comes and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arms and knees)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a close, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle hook and loop fastener which does not adhere to the lamination or seams
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and leg joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs hemmed for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have done a training in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly noticing that this job is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious-avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In rough terms, this means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think it has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family aid.
But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPD already causes problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it by now"/"I'm keeping him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm mentally handicapped" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a pickup appointment
What do you mean by returning please!
When I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book comes up.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein taken up with the feed is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and from these in turn builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.
1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.




One level scoop (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application for felling to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb
A serious traffic accident recently occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press alarm (2:03 pm), a car came into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Oh okay, I understand.
Well, then thank you very much again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought of.
Before I start here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that this is it - even if the conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past I always decided to keep going and at least finish the thesis, afterwards I can always switch.
But right now I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the thesis I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time then.
And the stress at work didn't matter at those moments.
Now even a family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the thesis is also going well, as far as feedback and so on is concerned.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter as is usually the case now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place in a year and be unhappy again.
You can see that everything is somehow confused, but maybe as outsiders you have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, that I'm completely done and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the weepy tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused considerable damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available for earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
This is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas were formed by cooled lava with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly hard hit.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "societal contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots, especially of children, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of Saint Nicholas and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys the fewest that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries there is a cheerful muddle over the question of who brings the children the gifts.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white fluffy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost has achieved some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been receiving this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date:
Please help me fix the error, as I 
will otherwise buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace
A armed man was shot by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum lighting time 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light fascinates with white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-free, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar lamp.
Place the "luminous stone" in any place that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide a secure hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery starts charging as soon as sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you decide what color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it has become light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher isn't credited, then I won't order out of principle.

In the lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway.....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation, especially with bell anchor motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on reddit after a year.
To my problem: About five years ago I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break I got pimples from 0 to 100 explosively and everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed on me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
I had a severe case of neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodular lichen and the acne topic.
I also tried all kinds of things in terms of nutrition due to chronic illness and I stayed with a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else really worked well.
It may also be that hormones are simply wrong, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't want to go looking for what else is wrong.
I had already written everything to your colleague Semina, etc.
And now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large sizes?
Since it is available in black in large sizes.

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Assessors decide together with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the email address given above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the possibility to store it for that long.
We would use the table as you offered, as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered the same armchair in blue in November and also received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
and when would the pickup be?
110 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived with us in parts so far.
The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week!
Forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass cabinet and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The cabinet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the cabinet cannot be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, which is why the request was made at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I have been in Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching but I currently still have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy in black and white for free at school (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a lot of time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and for me each lesson stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed into most stores.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
Revenue losses are to be lamented in stores with articles of non-daily needs, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Retail and online are the only sectors running well.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director.
"2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a lot of personnel.
The bracelet regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet received.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at around 90 percent.
"These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame that has been attempted to be camouflaged with yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively short distances, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
At the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press one of the memory buttons for a longer period and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is back - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality arises from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check in front of the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly attach it to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won twice in a row, were apparently on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned up, shot off their frustration over a mixed season start in a good hour and won spectacularly 5-2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "blanket praise to each and every one who was involved," he said.
At first it looked like another setback for the Frankfurters, who are still in ninth place and still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 in the lead.
What happened then impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we've shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his team mates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go step by step and stay modest" and "pull through the tasks at this level until the turn of the year".
Next up is already an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 pm, Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I just got the email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# to have it redirected, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would unfortunately mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
In the final of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can participate in the quarter-finals again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a bit better and at least get to five goals by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Groener's pupils sinned in all areas again and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
In the following, the German team could not muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

The title is given, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, it will continue partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to an individual (e.g. "I take medication X, does that go with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes informing about the vaccination, determining the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and has no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams we often do not have one with us, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused intense thinking in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed in the "Host mi?" series this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And not one "who needs everything to go quickly".
That, the TV presenter told the people, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg communicated the solution and probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines.
"The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also among many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for a racing bike - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I went out with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to do the rest of the route at all.
Since I had no real possibility to get replacement casing and replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to get this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
But when I think that I have to change the tire after 80-90kms while riding, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now of course the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ / tire now, only to be disappointed afterwards.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have 25x622 on the racing bike, I think.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires in this size, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
Does the Schwalbe website seem to recommend the Durano DD according to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had, for unknown reasons, collided with a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten in his car and then veered onto the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was then a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then skidded into a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and optically reminds of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal a matching designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the conditions at home in length.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for its size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with widebands to optimize the strongly increasing bundle of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 impresses with a very clear and fine sound, precisely aligned to the listening position.
By turning slightly outward, the treble range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using an overhead router, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can be varied in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, ie the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill facilitates the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the rear wall.
Then use a round router to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The footplate is then firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blowing out), one begins with the laying of the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Here you push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it hang out there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and also left hanging loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The circuit diagram of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be joining via broadcast, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Start chilling drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
