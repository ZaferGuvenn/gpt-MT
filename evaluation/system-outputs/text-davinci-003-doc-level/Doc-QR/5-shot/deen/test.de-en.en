The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to some extent.
Just take a look, help out for a bit, bring the bottle etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can entertain himself for a short time and it's OK for him, that's great.
You can best judge whether it fits your children.
It's not like he should change diapers and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Help me please to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore, maybe someone here knows something...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The detective has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
More suicides occur and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide before each suicide and document and post the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is familiar to anyone or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that could take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y.o., splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumb nail (outside) over the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grip.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on one circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker with sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register at a suitable digital control center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable control centers.
For control centers that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

What am I supposed to do with this number then??
Due to Omikron: Johnson will push forward the booster vaccination
Increasingly new Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of the rapidly increasing Omikron figures than previously planned.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, an emergency situation is facing us, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third vaccination.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
**I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't go.
Obviously, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
I first tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that hasn't been working for about
14 days now.
So I've been buying the last books always through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.

Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said about the review of the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
After the game, however, this did not subside - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What more than the bare result disappointed was the way of appearance.
By way of example, a statistic should be mentioned which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the victory in Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained".
Namely to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time", said the happy coach.
"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people".
However, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While even the performance leaders in Patrick's team such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and still came within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have consulted with a lawyer again and have written to them again.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always dressed to the nines: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then make up the dates postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot and with pleasure already as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be missed in the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but not flip through it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartments created through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be in stock again?
Or if it will ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great
Then I'll redeem it myself with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger
This is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has seen numerous tornadoes rip through the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, possibly claiming up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that your Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you respond?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company he was badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That's where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, trade, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions:
1. The heroes are all knocked out and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and helps the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play an important role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now I have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
So I would still like to send it back.
Can you then send the return slips, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been decreasing more and more over the season, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the start delay and the start accident put the schedule far behind the plan, they could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it seems that F1 has priority for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Still a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in the F1 again, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this possibility.
I think that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time guessing what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, as only the German audio track has to do without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So, this great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Order this one: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Lamp, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and still nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air pumps.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Air pumps are also suitable for setting accents in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can start.
The fan pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Just cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing back if water were to flow back from the tank through the pump...
If the fan pump is mounted outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take precautions so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the freight industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please don't rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it really hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly appointed astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the door to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his missions.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space again, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space trip from Blue Origin: Bezos himself was on board for the first in July, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently light up in one color or play through its entire color range.
Set to color change, the luminescent stone will keep one light color for about one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself all year round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, its light looks even better - only with shortened lighting time should be expected when the days are shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can get a matching replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the use of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about job prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely want to study up to the doctorate and will.
But now I have doubts, especially the job prospects depress me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) you always hear great job opportunities and the job is highly sought after, on the other hand you always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really unsure and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences with that, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Vacation & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up last week for me.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It seems like there is also stress before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in our Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend.
So what was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the ride, orders here orders there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and that must not be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve so much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage taking because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive mood by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do until the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage encountered in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment worthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the Central German network increased, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, so in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were preferred.
Only when it became clear that the refurbishment number of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus of the refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that switches stuck during switching operations.
Then the attendant who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to loosen the switches with a hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of outages of the locomotive.
[5] Since enough new locomotives were available by the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have been a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, resigned on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were checked and five driving motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the Central German network in Leipzig.
Main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with play traces, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the provided holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
Mine are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later
And I have to pay for shipping again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust," he said.
Fear can be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said then.
There is a prioritization for vaccinating the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities lost power on Friday evening.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborly help.
The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as Westnetz technicians were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power Flowing Again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9:30 p.m.
As of 11:15 pm, those still affected by the outage would have electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes when setting up and operating emergency power generators.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted the one with tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, however I can't slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return slip by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both did it anew and use version 4.5...
It could be that you have already heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
As soon as I try to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupted, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark colors could show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there could be unsightly metal streaks if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or transfers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An airplane cockpit is easier to stick before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the carrier paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check first whether the picture is in the right place before you slide it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I stopped reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they suddenly become difficult.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and were granted 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later we tried to get a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill them to the private health insurance.
We applied again for the cost coverage with the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts.
After some more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically we bill the most expensive ones to the private health insurance) we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
* Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the promises that the further attempts would expire with a birth?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three options by email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
OK.
We won't be ordering anything else from you.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You can feel free to pass that on to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it that the dresser arrives completely damaged at my place.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote.
It is clearly stated that the refund was initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what a low-budget film is exactly.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What do you find attractive about it?
And what don't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
Best regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will soon give up again because it simply does not work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can proclaim a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This state of suspension - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decide to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently it cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the Belarus border, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt to Cross the Border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night of Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authority on Sunday.
According to the information, the Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard fists and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'm checking this.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in the red and white jerseys on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I didn't receive any email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake to fix, not everyone in our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with you every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package would like to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
Admit it, neither of them will.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just stop it completely.
Yeah wow then you are as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
For me, a god started the whole thing.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to exact conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflection coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz municipality are selecting the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situations at the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And what about the coupon??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan which received and sent out 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module, which broadcasts the wifi, not the full 500 arrive, but the further away I am from the module in the house (i.e. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less arrives.
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who thought that current accounts would now be quiet is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the threshold and even quartered it for overnight deposits.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposits.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the thresholds in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks have now set a limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly create reserves - in case the higher courts declare negative interest rates to be generally inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one SINGLE chip from the bag).
That her heart is still equally sought after by female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame make one happy too.
Dignified End of a Career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barriers, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship 2007 in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, moving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner from Stuttgart, who had previously finished second, came fifth this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory in the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
"It was super cool for me, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm really happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now they said it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting only on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
It was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's the same for some of you...
I'm 24, have PTSD, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less (1-2x a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to do homework, which we of course have to divide up.
But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well regulated, I'm halfway well treated and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I'm getting by and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then it goes on afterwards?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think this has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening anyway, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.#NUMBER#.
Moreover, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
What do you think about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
Hope my question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well.
That's been a long time, then I would refrain from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand the modern (real world).
On the other hand the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a story develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself, I mean.
The transition is also, I believe, the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That will drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from its stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from this whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this channel is now below all standards.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" internet channel.
Quote Arno: You want to be "no running billboard".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make money off the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odors, mold or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave!)
Immediately after heating, shake the heat evenly throughout the pillow!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first warmings, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before warming the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during use to exclude overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat area is.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday life, stays well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it proverbially - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This allows the backpack to be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top-loading backpacks - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you are taking not only your photo equipment but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This also allows you to pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you are heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# promised me an email yesterday confirming the
contact with the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year went differently than expected I could not anticipate and did not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car with attractive and striking looks.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River spotted shining pieces in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were surveyed, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and making a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, covering each location once and ending the year.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped).

If you are a collector, I can also send cardboard in cardboard for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are no pressure points 100%.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation, as is sensible and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries Discussing Abolition of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for fully vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who are fully vaccinated," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for those who are fully vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday next week". − afp
So I want to return the lamp
What is the best way to go about it?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchases through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer are possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often in seeing images, and most rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, however,** u/Nitemarex **did not have it per definition.
I read their comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not answer.
Once again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had asked a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at 97
He distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify my life's thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I'm hooked and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef stock for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can manage it.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check that.
Where to get Christmas Roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't gotten poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier plays a major role in the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
This characteristic is perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds on the one hand.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which the sound level can be reduced without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even make a reserve of power available if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it like that with others.
Is there then a way to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
Iranian officials say progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," as there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated at first.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed on Thursday after a nearly week-long break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday with intensive medical care.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
Furthermore, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euros return fee is a cheek in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###MBundestag greetings to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the post here for?
If you look at the activity in the MBundestag in the past months, one thing can be said: It is non-existent.
We have come into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer hole for some months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, it should simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been done here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has been increasingly shown that many here really still have a desire for the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked, which would like to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and, simply put, has found a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# quilt, is it also available in an oversized size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to do that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much.
She herself had lived vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had also been a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I had long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, this cannot be changed as I cannot be present due to a funeral.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again continuously.
Lahnstein Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant decision for 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle water rescue of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein at the Lahnstein town hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanently increasing deployments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations but I synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's it then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course, especially in uniform and armed people, right from conservative magically attracts should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course have difficulty with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have next to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because these are rather less to none in the executive, but quite normal men and women whom one does not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or set it for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it sounds strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposedly fighting for them or trying to do them right, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, that these people are allowed to openly express their opinion or even openly forge any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who are often on foreign missions, often start to generalize due to negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are, in my opinion, well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled that it is not even possible for us to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany as well?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Become More Organized with a Child?
Hello, I (w32) have been thinking about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then and then I get motivated and tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "so that someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, I'm somewhere bothered by it but usually the household just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with a child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me I don't have any incentive, I just don't care that much as long as there is no visitors and e.g. always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arms and knees)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch area ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and leg joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs hemmed for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have done a training in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In short, this means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think this has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family aid.
But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPD already causes problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm mentally handicapped" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment
What do you mean by returning please!
When I downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cupboard.
The protein taken up with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and from these in turn builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.




1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is given until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application for felling to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't receive any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?

Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and Ideas for Further Career
Merry Christmas to you all first of all!
Unfortunately my Christmas is mediocre good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought of.
Before I start here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that this is it - even if the conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past I always decided to keep going and at least finish the thesis, afterwards I can always switch.
But right now I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the thesis I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time then.
And the stress at work didn't matter at those moments.
Now even a family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me additionally.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the thesis is also going well, as far as the feedback and so on is concerned.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I'm wondering if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter as is usually the case now.
But then I'm wondering if I won't be back at the same place in a year and be unhappy again.
You can see that it's all somehow confused, but maybe you have advice or ideas as outsiders to get me out of this situation, that I'm completely done and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the weepy tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused considerable damage.
Is an end in sight?
At 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
This is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas were formed by cooled lava with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly hard hit.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "societal contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of Saint Nicholas and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries there is a cheerful muddle over the question of who brings the children the gifts.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white fluffy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who achieved some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been receiving this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date:
Please help me fix the error, as I
otherwise will buy a different e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
The police said callers reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum lighting time 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light fascinates with white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-free, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar lamp.
Place the "luminous stone" in any place that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide a secure hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic casing is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging as soon as sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you decide what color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Finally, the shutdown also takes place automatically when the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it is light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation especially with bell armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pains during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to leave it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break I got pimples from 0 to 100 explosively and everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed on me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and hassle-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
I had a severe case of neurodermatitis before, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
I also tried all kinds of nutrition in connection with my chronic illness and stayed with a sugar, milk and low-meat mix because nothing else really worked.
It may also be that hormones are simply the worm in it, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't want to go looking for what else is wrong.
I had already written everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I had written it and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in large sizes in black.

In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgments
In the courtroom they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Assessors, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot log into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of storing it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Sure, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
and when would the pickup be?
110-kV underground cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (Geography)
Hello colleagues,
I have been in Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching but I currently have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently in terms of time.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can basically only use the board, the school book and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a lot of time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and for me each lesson stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter most stores.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
In stores with items of non-daily needs, revenue losses are to be lamented, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director.
"2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel expenditure.
The band regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer must only be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, in the retail sector - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at around 90 percent.
"These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame that was attempted to be camouflaged with yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively short distances, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
At the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press one of the memory buttons for a longer period and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is back - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality arises from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly attach it to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Spectacular Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won in two consecutive games, were apparently on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned up, shot off their frustration over a mixed season start in a good hour and won spectacularly 5-2. "It's amazing what the boys did today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "blanket praise to each and every one who was involved,".
At first it looked like another setback for the Frankfurters, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 in the lead.
What happened then impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with a particular view for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go step by step and stay modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level until the end of the year".
Next up is already on Wednesday as part of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 pm, Sky) on the program.
I just got the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# to have it redirected, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would mean for me that I won't be ordering again because it already took a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for Handball Women before Quarter-Final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to appear differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Below par from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This was not the hoped-for spark, however.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women could hardly make a scene - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can participate in the quarter-finals again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a bit better and at least get to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, Groener's pupils sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is counted among the medal candidates at the final round.
In the following, the German team could not muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, it will continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medication X, does that go with the vaccination..").
My tasks include informing about the vaccination, making an indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and has no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams we often do not have one with us, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger Knows the Answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused some intense thinking in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed in the "Host mi?" series.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
Nor one "who needs everything to go quickly".
That, the TV presenter told the people, was completely wrong.
At which point the man from Amberg gave the answer and probably caused amazement among many Upper Palatines.
"The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Thus closing a gap in education - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for racing bike - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said and done and I drove off with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to take part in the rest of the route at all.
Since I had no real possibility to get replacement casing and replacement tube due to the weekday, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It was not so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would not like to get this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike had ridden 120km until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several years on a roller.
But if I think about having to change the tire after 80-90kms while riding, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now of course the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ / tire now, only to be disappointed afterwards.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have on the racing bike I think 25x622.
These are also available (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central island for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, according to the police.
There was then a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then skidded into a tree and the man in the car was trapped.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and optically reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal a matching designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the given conditions at home in length.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for its size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with widebands to optimize the strongly increasing bundle of too high frequencies.
Precisely aimed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the treble range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housing, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using an overhead router, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows now, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are then glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can be varied in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, ie the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the rear wall.
Then use a round router to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The footplate is then glued firmly to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screw points of the speaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest done through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Here you push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it hang out there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and also left hanging loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
By the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
finally we can announce that we will be organizing the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be connected, so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - nevertheless we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Put drinks in the fridge, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
