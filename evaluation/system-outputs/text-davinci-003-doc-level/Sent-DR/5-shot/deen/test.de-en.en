The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a big customer of #PRS_ORG#, so it's no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Frankly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also generally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings in moderation.
Just take a quick look, give a quick helping hand, bring the bottle, etc.
This way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and is okay with it, that's a good thing.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably dubious.
Perhaps that is why the psychologist made her statement.
For if something were to happen such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you're willing to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows what it is...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken up by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, finds herself at the doorstep of his therapist who runs a clinic treating patients with phobias.
The commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos online before each suicide.
It turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses the fear center in the brain, ultimately forcing them to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window and another deliberately drives herself to death.)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic involving a fire.
That's the gist of it; I'm fairly certain the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side).
Tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to pin down.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

Johnson to Push for Omikron Vaccine Booster Shots
New Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year's Day, therefore, all eligible adults in England should have been offered a vaccine.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to move faster on coronavirus booster vaccinations in light of rapidly rising Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should be offered a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since their second jab, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccine campaigns in the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that the emergence of the Omikron variant posed an emergency, and that urgent steps must be taken to strengthen the vaccine protection.
The good news is that protection levels can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's get a booster shot now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the day before, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with their pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter" but a slightly more complicated one.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How else could such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Trying on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for about.
No more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
But there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add two chairs to the order and bill me for them.
The feeling of helplessness.
Content Warning: I will be discussing domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence in my professional life.
One issue that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things that move me more in my profession than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of retribution, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
But it will never get any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, and a stunning presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg suffer derby defeat to Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But the disappointment didn't end there after the 61-72 (28-38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
But more than the bare result, it was the manner of the performance that disappointed.
To illustrate the whole dilemma, here's a statistic: the three-point shooting percentage was a mere 13%, with 4 makes (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - need I say more?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We just weren't focused enough after our win at Teneriffa and didn't execute what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim had a very different reaction: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the delighted coach.
"It felt like I was performing in front of 10,000 people."
Despite only 750 spectators being allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they certainly got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team to victory.
"The best playmaker I ever coached," Gleim added in praise.
While even the star performers on Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster, coming within eight points after having been down 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7pm), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Always dressed to the nines: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with his reinterpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
He is currently on tour with his show "Hello, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't come to that.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season have also been cancelled, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up for the dates that had to be postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with great enthusiasm since he was a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with a repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the MTV Unplugged series (2019) reached the second spot on the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
With his program "Good Day, Dear Luck", he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hi #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working; I can only see the cover page but can't flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new German Federal Minister of Building and Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives, and housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to decide how to handle the results of the referendum.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition, including talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement includes a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets, and an expansion of rent indexing.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to make this happen as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hi, I wanted to place an order and I noticed after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will apply the discount automatically on the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
How long will it take for the lamp to be shipped if it is sent in March?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an outrageous affront.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths may be mourned.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, possibly claiming up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer swath of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear, who visited the disaster area, said that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that being possible.
He estimates that up to one hundred people have died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of display case #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been taken out of the lineup altogether?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase from another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it shipped to Germany that is in my shopping cart?
I had submitted a return request through the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are offering vaccine bonuses and changing their slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners, the Austrian Trade Union Federation and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Following the German example, the repurposing of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination is also intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay put in his old job and went looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the reservation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Assistance with First Campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Across the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I'm writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the action will unfold.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, bargaining, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the village mayor's son, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
If defeat seems inevitable, the half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still here, all is good.
How appropriate do you find the deus ex machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure to start with?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the receipts sent over so I can package up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky has been deteriorating over the season, so I'm using this post to vent a bit.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start crash put the schedule far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It appears that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice in the matter.
Still, it was a foolish move, especially since Sky UK had broadcast the race to its conclusion.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a moment of rule ignorance from commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both were unaware that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only when there were radio messages to Hamilton about it that both teams agreed that Verstappen could change his tires.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think these basic rules should just be known if you are commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time they've had to guess what is allowed or required by the rules; they simply have a constant uncertainty about the rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos's artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I honestly prefer even Heiko Wasser from RTL.
To top it off, there are constant sillinesses that make them both look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, apparently not taking it seriously.
Finally, Sky's advertising is simply out of control; in the closing stages, Sky is the only channel that goes to advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
These two channels also make less commercial breaks during their broadcasts than Sky does, and they are free-to-air channels.
While I must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
So, at least, the grand F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I'm curious to hear your opinion.
This one: #PRS_ORG# Pendant Light, Brass and Multi-Colored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not heard anything back yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am asking for help.
Air pumps are an excellent way to provide additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filtration system over airlifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are ideal so that you can connect multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. Air pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, one might mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm, and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be level with, or higher than, the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, should water ever flow backwards, the water from the basin running through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we list the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we are packing daily and the packages are picked up daily as well.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets upset if it takes a bit longer.
It is so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here, Corona does not stop.
Please don't judge us harshly if the delivery is delayed, it is entirely out of our hands and is due to the courier services.
We may complain about these services, even though we have to admit that they are having a hard time right now.
This varies greatly by region as well.
Be kind to one another, stay safe, and we all hope for better times ahead.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can I also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.
The roughly ten-minute flight took off and landed in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts back home.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers emerged one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), the first American astronaut to fly into space in 1961 and for whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reflected on her father's mission after the short flight.
He said he had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He said he would love to go back to space again, the host said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing periods of weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: on the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second event in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's deputy chief executive Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and with little regard for the climate.

Someone who works in or has studied biochemistry.
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind the lab work (I already have my inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I had of course already done some research on career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely continue studying until I got my PhD.
But I'm starting to have doubts, especially concerning my job prospects, which are particularly disheartening.
On the one hand, you hear about great job prospects and high demand for the profession, but on the other hand, you hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying positions.
So I'm really curious to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you receive?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really uncertain and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down!
Extra Stress Before Holiday and Weekend Breaks
This topic came up for me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax from it all.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
Not only before big holidays like Christmas do we experience a lot of stress at work.
It seems there are also days off before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day.
So last week was a long four-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Loud emails that had to be sent out before Ascension Day, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been so long and that can't be the case?
Or because people seriously want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed hostage situation due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't properly enjoy them?!
The stress, it should be noted, did not come from the top; the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home, but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
"The great thing is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the festive days arrive, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, so I really have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in aviculture is due solely to nutritional deficiencies.
Since feathers are composed of protein-rich substances, a balanced and rich protein diet is necessary for the formation of a perfect feather coat in birds.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during molt are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
The unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced in the composition of NEKTON-Bio.
No other vitamin supplement should be given while NEKTON-Bio is being administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
DDR Handarbeit Model Old Building E-Locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play wear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a torsion bar drive from AEG, with the mechanical part supplied by Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the electrical part supplied by Siemens-Schuckertwerke.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, receiving the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived World War II and found themselves in the territory of what would later become East Germany.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Dessau Railway Repair Works, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the more plentiful E 04, E 44, and E 94 models were favored for production.
It was only when it became clear that the processing rate of the E94 could not be increased further that the E95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were usually deployed in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As they got older, the complicated controls on the locomotives proved problematic.
It was not uncommon for triggers to get stuck during switching operations.
Then the fireman, who was constantly riding on the locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the shovel during the ride.
Damage to the locomotive's driving motors was frequent, leading to months-long outages of the locomotive.
By the late 1960s, enough new locomotives had been built and no significant expansion of electric operations was planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, and the E 95s were taken out of service.
Adding to their woes, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have posed a problem in train operations due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last of them, the E 95 01, was taken out of service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn authorities to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was fully completed internally.
The locomotive is preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P heritage society have been working on restoring the locomotive to working order.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, with the transformers checked and five traction motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their efficient drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of operations was initially Silesia.
H0 handcrafted model in original packaging, functioning well, some optical work on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which unfortunately were produced with errors.
The middle bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But it doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose.
They're not flat on me.
Could I get these sent to me?
Hi #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Two people lightly injured and extensive damage in residential building fire
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated six-figure euro damage has been caused, according to police on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police have taken over the further investigations.
But that will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now, the businessman has released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him to do so.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine.
There were false rumors circulating on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
"My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because he does not want the communication to be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
His school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, often stoked by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet has Uğur Şahin saying he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Legally, I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccine distribution in Germany.
Now the prioritization has been lifted - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday night, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no electricity and in many cases, no heating.
A fire had knocked out a power substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday night, 41,000 residents in several towns were left in the dark due to the fire.
Utility provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators had been in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damage would take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally put some of the lines back into operation.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt power line has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday at 6pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
As of 11:15 PM, those who were still affected by the outage have had their electricity restored.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings.
"It is now important that citizens look after elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after an emergency meeting.
The focus of setting up and running emergency generators was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the tickets for Germany are sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
This is the #PRS_ORG# blue-green day blanket.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay safe ♡
But I can't mount the bracket on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't collapse and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Let's do it then!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
But before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insulting.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to concede defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both updated and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems before.
I just bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# e-book file.
Can you help me?
What now that the chat connection is gone?
I have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you put brush to model with a new color for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts where it won't be seen later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component
Brush the paint evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later creates a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates areas that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks may occur when they mix with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before assembling them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models, decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is having time, patience, and a steady hand when it comes to sticking things.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also known as water-slide decals because you moisten the back of them with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the image a little bit off the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
As you hold the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Warning: Always check that the picture is properly aligned before you slide it off the paper completely, so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Wipe up excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only open a book for a short time, and if I look away then I can't read it anymore and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp arrived in three separate packages.
Thanks anyway!
Then I will shop elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Private Health Insurance for Fertility Treatment / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone!
We had been undergoing fertility treatments for some time, but now that it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance company, they are suddenly refusing to pay.
In order:
We had applied for fertility treatment coverage with our private health insurance in advance and were granted approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not in any way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth, and was billed to the health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the health insurance.
We applied again for reimbursement from the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more than promised, of course, billing the most expensive to the health insurance company), we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the health insurance company only wanted to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance will expire with the pregnancy/birth.
The second wish is for a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the room are:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have warned us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Having the first child does not cure infertility caused by blocked fallopian tubes.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
Okay.
We will not be ordering from them anymore.
If you add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), it's obvious you have lost good customers.
Feel free to pass that on to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you're telling me I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely broken.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two loyal customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I am not able to procure a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them here.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a low-budget film, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say on the matter:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, having already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Looking to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, no chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'm about to give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half-victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' borders with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The researcher from the Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) declared that the EU had not resolved the confrontation sustainably.
This limbo - Belarus not quite giving in, but the EU feeling like the victor - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole fails to take a stand against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion of the Union at the same time.
"She apparently can't prevail when a member state decides to go its own way," as is currently the case with Poland, which won't even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to its border.
Moreover, Bossong said, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the Belarus border: reaching a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt at Crossing Borders
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border overnight.
Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them with the promise of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the migrants to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response has been the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has flexed its market power and demonstrated its willingness to operate with hard-hitting, extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not used to the security apparatus regularly shuttling thousands of people around the country.
Mercedes Protests Controversial Formula 1 Finish
Mercedes believes Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has lodged an appeal after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest has been lodged against Max Verstappen in the Red Bull for allegedly overtaking illegally during the last safety car phase.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver came shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I'm checking on it.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day.
Europa-Park, namesake of the SC Freiburg Stadium, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Plus, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars glowed red and white that day through the jerseys.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park has once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing happy guests having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yes, wow, then you are just as not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a god set it all in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is only 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain the best field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free even in the edge zone.
Magnification ratings are often used to label magnifying lenses.
But these figures only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely match the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your magnifying glass, please refer to the Technical Data table (see the user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When used under optimal conditions - the magnifying glass held close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz community select the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
It is even said that one man drove home alone because he and his partner could not agree.
He plants around 2,000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has experienced his fair share of bizarre situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit more fun.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective shipment and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to debate which dish is better here, but there is certainly some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names for it.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbps without any issues, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590, and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox receives them as well.
However, at the other DLan module which transmits the wifi, I no longer get the full 500, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less I get (so using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This has resulted in the internet being even slower with the new fiber connection on the first floor (\~45 Mbit) than before.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the D-Lan, but there were still similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to run LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more grateful for a response.
When It's Time to Switch Bank Accounts
Those who thought that the checking accounts would now be at peace have been proven wrong.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to drop.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with its limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for savings accounts.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
But now these lower thresholds apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual arrangements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still stands, as does the limit at ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered its free allowance in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
At least, according to the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now offer a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also set its limit at 25,000 euros, though there is still a legal dispute with consumer protection agencies, who won the first round in the Berlin District Court against this rule.
Now, banks are already discussing whether they should set aside reserves in case higher courts declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal.
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one chip from the bag).
That they have managed to capture the hearts of both male and female fans alike is nothing short of a miracle.
Perhaps because she's just unlucky in love and still searching for her great romance.
And crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
She had been constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who ask that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen forced to retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the barriers, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, as the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport's premier class.
His wife Minttu and two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's record of 94 wins is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he tweaked the material settings and on Sunday pulled out a 0.30 second lead.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat out the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner of Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after having placed second previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it too," Lochner said.
Nolte Wins Home Race - Podium for Jamanka
On the women's side, Laura Nolte clinched her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After settling for fourth place the day before in the monobob, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple victory.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She notched her first podium finish of the winter, in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
I was so cool to get my first podium in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am really happy with the progress.
"There's still a lot of potential to be tapped, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just pushing off, there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not quite perfect runs, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it, so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I'm finally asking about it.
Last year, with the pandemic, I had other problems and never had the time for it.
And now they said it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I'd like to return it and then reorder it since it's on sale :)
Why is the shipment being launched on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
It was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only one more day, only one more week, only until XY...
Hello wonderful girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write down, and maybe some others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's pretty much my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs too and I wanted to see and feel him; we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand was bandaged due to a burn).
He is also under the weather and we are seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having tummy troubles, so I cooked him something and now he's lying in his blanket, having relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and some petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to divide up the housework too.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently well-managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm doing okay.
Not great, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot of me right now; I have a written test tomorrow at 3pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and I should at least prepare a bit for my anatomy class the day after tomorrow.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So this is how my week goes: only two more days until the weekend.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on and on.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental anchors, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Does this resonate with you too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams without it.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry, so I thought I'd find some kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first shipment was the exact color as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
Twice, in fact.
But it was not confirmed.
Completely off-topic: I noticed back in school that many religious studies teachers don't actually believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always felt strange to me, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
What is your opinion on this?
Maybe you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What motivates someone to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something?
Hope this question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, so I would advise against it.
All good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie.
Hello everyone!
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman, whom I cannot describe in more detail in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action is set in motion.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to gain life for himself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's tomb.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this rings a bell, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often but don't be overbearing.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from its stomach?
Or is it face down directly into the mattress?
You can tell from that whether everything is alright.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to put babies to sleep on their stomachs.
We are also already "regular customers" of yours and have purchased many items already.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not heard back yet.
This is regarding my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I urge you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held on to.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it's just that the politics of this station are now lower than low.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno said, "We don't want to be a billboard."
What are we now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel trying to peddle its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit off of the exploding rented rooms.
How can anyone find this acceptable?
Great if you like it, I find it awful.
I am requesting a call back as the wooden table I received was delivered defective.
Corpus breach due to damaged shipment from #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling, My Little Warm Friend is versatile and can be used for many purposes.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft fabric makes the application especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they don't feel well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable for use as a heat pad only for the following applications:
Before warming the pillow, check for any unusual odors, stains, or scorch marks, and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, shake the pillow to evenly distribute the warmth!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On initial warming, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating a pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores have come out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please refer to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt Second After First Half - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt after a late win in the top game, joy in Hannover for interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after a failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to run it.
Nothing doing, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start even with the power cord plugged in.
So I took out the battery, but still nothing happened.
Do you guys have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on AC power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour but still need to bring a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity easily swallows larger photo gear, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, stay organized and separate from your photography gear thanks to convenient access in the customizable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design packs a punch - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works in two ways: first, conventionally, via the lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an ingeniously designed solution for effective protection that has already proven itself on messenger bags.
There is a metal clasp hook in the flap closure, with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If your backpack is heavily loaded, take the top bar, if it is lighter, take a lower one.
The clasp and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second feature that sets the Everyday Backpack apart from other camera backpacks is the dual zipper access on both sides of the bag in addition to the top lid opening.
This eliminates the biggest downside of traditional top-loading backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: if you want to take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
The Everyday Backpack allows you to customize the interior (more on that below) so you can easily store and access both items separately through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while keeping your everyday items safely in the left half of the backpack and out of the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with this.
And with the backpack's outer shell made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're headed to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company has announced contact to arrange for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any news yet.
I request immediate settlement.
I am now on my third customer service representative, and none of them have been able to do more than promise me an email confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly shipped Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help.
Wishing you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on January 12th, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture instead of returning it.
And that last year didn't turn out as expected, I couldn't have foreseen and wasn't able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one who suffers the damage, and I won't accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly, sparking the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - it seems the other pioneers have had the same idea!
You must outshine your pioneering peers or else go down with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn the rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can take actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock-out!
This deactivates one half of the site, reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the auctioneer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the caller has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games in foil) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
All other items usually shipped with DPD, insured and with tracking (games shrink-wrapped, wrapped in bubble wrap and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional fee of 2 euros, ensuring that there will be no pressure marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, and power abuse in intimate relationships.
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, so I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
His book "Why Our Kids Are Turning Into Tyrants" (2008) sparked a fierce debate about parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever seek power over the child.
Our goal should always be to give the child space to grow and to make the frame for the child as large as possible in the given situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries Discussing Removal of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated People
The health ministers of the states are set to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been fully vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of the 2G+ requirement for those who have been fully vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday. - afp
So I want to return the lamp.
How should I go about doing that?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair looks great, but I can't tell how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website is possible on a computer.
I have updated the account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as "awareness," or sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this involves hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, while this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, u/Nitemarex had none by definition.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The least they could do is take back the broken chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce, in addition to legal requirements.
Please check again if they will at least take back the broken chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We're losing money on that too.
I have already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
One more time, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the doorstep due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why haven't I been called?
I had posed a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle passes away at 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle up until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has passed away.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby give thanks for my life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardized wooden pallet used primarily in Europe as a cargo carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not recorded.
New York Wins First MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regulation time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
It was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I'm hooked and I want to try cooking rouladen for the first time this New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens now?
What about the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I can manage that.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
But to this day, the money has not come to me.
Please check that.
Where to find Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten the poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of a guitar amp sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust both the desired level and the amount of distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers feature a unique POWER LEVEL control, allowing you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a reserve of power when things get too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This incoming signal is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an extremely "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who invest in an additional VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their feet, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had others seen it that way?
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hi, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If that's not possible, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on something I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Deal Negotiations
Iranian officials have reported progress in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," as there was initially not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is meant to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, talks in Vienna to revive the agreement resumed after a near one-week hiatus.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, though only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence in Germany.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but was still above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
Two hundred people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
Delays in reporting may occur on weekends.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the influx of new cases.
I understand.
Perhaps it will be possible by then, since the delivery is not due until early March.
I just need to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/fill out/enter anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It is time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If one looks at the activity in the German Bundestag over the past months, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have fallen into a winter stupor and extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely just a reflection of the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we are generally perceived.
In recent days, there has been a growing sense that many people here still have a real desire for the Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
Here, it is up to the community around the Bundestag to decide if they want to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who had recently become aware of this project and found, to put it simply, a mess.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have come together who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to take this opportunity to urge everyone to participate, as only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Erhöhung der Investitionen in die öffentliche Infrastruktur
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed, adjusted, or removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord for that at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, come join us on Discord and help us democratically decide our future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for this and not to my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the #PRS_ORG# quilt come in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to do that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you will need to work with #PRS_ORG# to figure out how that will work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pickup date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to get these or decide to return them?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I myself had been a vegetarian for several years prior.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I used to think that by being a vegetarian, I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
That is why I have decided to go vegan.
At that moment, I sensed a hint of resentment from her side, as she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my response was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me even trying to create them.
Greetings from a peace-loving vegan!
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, since I cannot be there due to a funeral, there is nothing I can do to change that.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
Starting February 1st, I will be available again on a continuous basis.
Lahnsteiner Water Rescue Prepared: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, mayor of Lahnstein.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are expecting a permanent increase in activity: the boom in hotel river cruises on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued rise in the use of the Lahn as a recreational river, are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of before the problems started.
I can't open the book.
But following their recommendations, I have tried syncing, deleting, and re-downloading the app and nothing has worked.
I'm getting frustrated because this whole process has taken up so much of my time and I'm hoping for some help now.
Alright, that's settled then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing, I too spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed agents of the executive, but I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, however, it should be noted that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people are naturally drawn to those in uniform and carrying weapons, and it is also clear that these people may have difficulty dealing with the reality of the situation, since in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and I'm not talking about the overly feminine stereotypical gay, because there are very few of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't know unless they told you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in the end they can save your life or put theirs on the line for you.
But even these fringe groups, strange as it may sound, tend to have a conservative outlook in my experience, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less represented by overly left-wing politics, even if those policies are supposedly meant to benefit them or make them feel heard. They just want to be treated like everyone else.
Going back to the right, since police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme right-wingers there, but it is completely exaggerated by the media that they are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly hatch any plans that threaten the state, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have been deployed abroad often start to generalize and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things can be fought well in my opinion, and political education and enlightenment can be used to counter it!
Germany is so internationally intertwined, and rightly so in my opinion, that we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered it back in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
I'm still waiting for my order that is no longer available.
I had been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could we have the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black shipped to Germany, or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Neater through child?
Hi, I (w32) have been thinking about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed with very little free time), but I have never been able to keep my household clean and organized on a permanent basis.
There are always times when everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "as if someone could just drop by spontaneously".
My husband is no better (unfortunately), it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
So, to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
For me, there's no incentive to keep it tidy, as long as there are no visitors and there's always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive to stay organized or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your replies.

A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a software development training and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have low self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (though I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything about it online.
The code review process is already causing me problems (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really dumb" etc.).
I'm probably going to have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you gotten the sofa back already?
There was no confirmation of that.
I am waiting for a pickup date.
What do you mean by "give back" please?
When I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, I get the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book."
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein it has ingested in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and then uses these to build its own proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the moulting of feathers in adult birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this curative dose of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level scoop (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but this chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and I attached pictures.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a petition was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, and thus walnuts, is not part of the regulations.
But the charter explicitly lists the walnut tree as one to be protected.
Can I trust the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I need to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?

Oh, I see.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and Ideas for Further Career Paths
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... In short, I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - so from you guys.
I'm doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'm googling other job postings" run.
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to keep going and at least finish the draft, and then I can always switch direction afterwards.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referendum, I thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekends were my weekends and my evenings were my evenings.
I had the day off.
And the stress of work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now even family gatherings are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that really get on my nerves.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the ref is doing well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and I worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now, feeling just as dissatisfied.
You can see that it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely overwhelmed by and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to at least see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continually evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely cutting-edge in terms of sound.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET) which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation can.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system that produces natural resonances in abundance.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even tweak and twist historical facts in the virtual realm until your amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined multiple times since then to meet the ever-evolving demands of sound, which in 2010 led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and a plethora of significantly improved amp models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed to meet the needs of all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
After an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp section is the key to the tube-like character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop dividers, it can be tailored to fit your photography gear and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup could be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an attachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Plus, you can store lots of accessories.
And those with a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for both their photography equipment and other non-photography items.
Drone pilots will also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
At 85 days and counting, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was thought to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Activity from the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists still cannot predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damages
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree Celsius lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other structures, according to RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed from cooled lava, with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is immensely important to the island and which directly or indirectly supports about half of its 85,000 inhabitants, was particularly hard hit, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas Became Santa Claus
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas season closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts of some kind were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, threw gold secretly into the windows of three women in one night, to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of gift-giving emerged the popular German tradition of filling the boots of children, in particular, with presents.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such matters so seriously, it only bothers a few that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin tradition of caroling and processions, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots by the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources attest to a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
But in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a jolly jumble of confusion over who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas to whom some characteristics have been attributed over time.
These include his white flowing beard, which bears little resemblance to the more austere Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for entering houses through the chimney.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have guided them to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who gained some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police Shoot Suspected Bank Robber Near Royal Palace
A man armed with a knife was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man seen entering a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist motive.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored to the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone is responsible for this solar light's fascinating glow, either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The smooth, amorphous design is intentional: like a naturally-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
It also does well in the company of larger pebbles and rocks, where its size allows it to hold its own.
You can save yourself a lot of work: "Smart Stone" solar lights don't require wiring or batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide secure anchoring if needed.
The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging when sunlight hits the casing.
As dusk falls, Smart Stone automatically lights up, and you can choose from six attractive colors, in addition to daylight white.
The system will also automatically shut off once the battery level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
As soon as the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if my coupon isn't applied, then I won't be ordering anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Please send me the number for the sideboard.
No hardware store was open during the lockdown anyway.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved again in a fundamental way.
An adjustable PWM frequency ranging from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super quiet operation, especially for bell-armature motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adjusted to even difficult cases up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough to power even older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies!
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
As for my problem: I reluctantly started taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and awful PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that behind, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem was not the pain but my skin.
On my last break, which lasted about two years, I suddenly got an explosion of acne all over my body.
So far so superficial, but it weighed heavily on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year hiatus, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and I still have to wait for my dermatologist appointment.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have tried all sorts of diets due to my chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy, and low meat diet because nothing else seemed to work properly.
It may well be that hormones are simply to blame, but when you have so many other things going wrong, like I do, you don't really want to go looking for more things that could be wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague Semina, etc.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my inquiry.
I had to keep working and answering the phone and then suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
but is it generally available in large quantities?
since it is widely available in black

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgement.
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothing.
But much hangs on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: jurors, along with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them spoke to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hi, unfortunately I can't log into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice for order #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping them for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
I had already ordered and received the same chair in blue in November, and so I would now like to order one in grey because they are so nice.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pick-up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110 kV underground cables will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is now legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel with the shipment number #NUMBER# sent by #PRS_ORG# has been returned with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget it, I already explained that multiple times yesterday!!
This is a glass dresser and the entire sides have burst open, leaving glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the same with all books, which is why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I've been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I'm still having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not very technologically advanced, so I basically only have access to the chalkboard, textbooks, and an overhead projector as teaching mediums.
At school, I can only make black and white copies for free (which is annoying for geography).
I'm currently just taking a really long time to plan out my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, I'm repeating the same methods, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need that time for other activities, etc.).
I usually start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to structure it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with the book Terra and most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have indeed decided to go for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G rule for the Christmas business.
Most stores are now only allowing entry to those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and laments the loss of revenue.
He also has a possible solution at the ready.
The 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE).
Stefan Genth, head of the HDE, criticized that there have been declines in sales of non-essential items.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of businesses had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had written off the Christmas season.
"What should have been the high point of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only the grocery and online retail sectors that are doing well.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
Shopping with masks, social distancing, and hygiene protocols is a safe affair, said the chief executive.
"Using 2G when shopping won't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations were deterring customers and requiring a lot of manpower.
He called for the bracelet system to be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would be granted access to all stores with the bracelet they received that day.
Furthermore, in retail, as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
Even the shopping center-focused real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas season.
The frequencies were last at around 75% of pre-corona levels without 2G, and the revenues at around 90%.
"These figures will certainly drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions and approvals are being sought for the centers.
This includes the so-called "bracelet solution", where "visitors can present their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that has been attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
What do I need to do next to return this?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is its ease of use and intuitive operation.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely free of flicker.
The 120-degree beam angle that allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
Even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for NP-F batteries (not included)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign it.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with battery power using inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - with a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight with the supplied power supply.
The assembly of the spotlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm sleeve for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your camera tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using the stops on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of the highest quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is included in the delivery.
This way, you can easily transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Were Planning to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Thrilling Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won in their last two games, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned it on, scoring five goals in the space of an hour to vent their frustration at a patchy start to the season and winning 5-2 in style. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, issuing a "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who remain in ninth place and still below expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
"And then the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, also highlighted the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is huge," the 27-year-old said, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the tasks ahead, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is remarkable that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players are living a highly professional lifestyle as well.
Now they want to "go step by step and stay humble" and "carry out the tasks at this level" by the end of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6:30 PM, Sky).
I just received an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women trudged off the court with their heads hung low and vacant looks after their humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the German national team suffered a heavy 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After their first loss in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points, behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't keep the momentum going.
"That was a bad game all around that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
To make it to the semi-finals, a marked improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runners-up on Tuesday, in order to keep alive the faint dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits, and urged, "We have to look forward now quickly."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in their previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark from the start of the match.
Errant passes and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some great saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
But this was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women were unable to make much of an impression - and when they did, they were often thwarted by the strong play of goalkeeper Althea Reinhardt of the Scandinavians.
So the game was effectively over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke was shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent shortly afterwards.
She will be allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game better and at least got within five goals of the opposition by half-time.
Any faint hope of a comeback after the changeover was extinguished after just seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster any further improvement and left the court as clear losers.

As a vaccinator, I am part of mobile vaccination teams that are currently administering the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine primarily in nursing homes.
With these nearly complete, I will then move on to some of the vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions as long as they are not related to a specific individual (e.g. "I take medication X, will that be compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include providing information about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Order and has no reasons against it), medical documentation, and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
However, in our vaccination teams we often don't have a doctor present, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not allowed to carry out vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger Knows the Answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused a stir in the Bavarian television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unguessed by the callers in the "Host mi?" series.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
Nor anyone who "needs everything to happen quickly".
The people heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
To the amazement of many in the Upper Palatinate, the man from Amberg then revealed the solution.
The audience learned that "the huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
Noting that this was a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
Thus, a gap in education was closed - even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message appears: "Oops - something went wrong - try again later."
I have rebooted, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has worked.
Tire selection for road racing - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm, wanting to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Saying that, I set off on my new racing bike, which I had bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in any inner city (this time: thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, there was a loud hiss and my back tire was no longer willing to go the rest of the way.
With no real way to get a replacement coat and hose on a weekday, I had to turn around with a somewhat sour mood and take the first train home.
Even though it wasn't too bad in terms of the weather, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch over several days ahead of me, I would really rather not have this problem recurring.
It wasn't so bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike!) were already deemed suboptimal, as he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires, which are supposedly puncture-proof.
Now, of course, this all sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I'm not keen on spending 40€ per tire only to be disappointed in the end.
I'm still wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that are apparently narrower, but most are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tires for a road bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to be recommending the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually resembles its big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a specially designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
By design, the SOLO 15 is well-suited for those who prioritize sound quality over maximum volume, but still want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker simply cannot generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That doesn't mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she behaves remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-end boost in tone.
This is common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing concentration of high frequencies.
Precisely aimed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Tilting slightly outward can reduce the high-frequency range and make the sound warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of each component of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the cutout for the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8mm hole in the bottom board at the corresponding spot, in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be beveled at a 45° angle to make the opening of the speaker chassis as large as possible on the inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, you start to build the box itself, placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back panel, lid, front, and bottom will now be glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16mm MDF.
The second side is then attached in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to install the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
Next, mark and pre-drill (2.5mm drill bit) the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suctioned/blown out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is most easily achieved through the 35mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
The entire, uncut cable is then pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of cable protruding.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
The crossover is then prepared and installed.
The design of the crossover and the corresponding wiring diagram can be found in the following document: Solo 15 Crossover Assembly Instructions.
Once the crossover is installed and the terminal is screwed in, the 8mm cable opening inside the box needs to be sealed, but not completely closed.
With a 35 mm bass reflex opening and a bit of skill, one can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now comes the dampening, as described.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a sheet of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone!
Finally, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for reasons we are all aware of, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – yet we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 12:30.
Get the drinks chilled, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
