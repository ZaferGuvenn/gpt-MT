Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a décor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to mention.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an air hose or similar... And you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards if the water from the basin ran through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we give the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.

It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,... They have it damn hard
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.

NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting process and plumage regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
GDR handicraft model old E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railroader ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The Class E 95 is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network,  possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are refurbished
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this line.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with axle bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau the reconditioning of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, with the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining engines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were preferably built.
Only when it became apparent that the number of refurbishments could not be further increased in the case of the E 94 did the E 95 come into the focus of the refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren locomotive depot.
They came in 1960 to the locomotive depot Halle P.
They were used in their own circulating plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geisel valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it often happened that shooters got stuck during switching operations.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the shooters again with hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of failures of the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most splinter classes, so that the E 95s were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the engines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, they were followed by E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the exterior refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after by a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of storage.
In order for the paint application to be uniform and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Drag the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick brush swipes.
This results in unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve true to the original appearance through the decals or decals.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touches.
Attach the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or easier before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you moisten their back briefly with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you push the image just a small piece of the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper sideways.
Attention: Always check whether the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick, wrinkle or even tear on your finger.
Suction excess water with a household towel.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers hi-fi quality on your system.
There is practically no difference to the original audible.
A Class-D audio power amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which may have between 4 ohms and 32 ohms impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual sounds can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the prototypical simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually without indexing and color errors up to the edge zone.
Loupes are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, mildew or burn marks and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand for warming!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the specifications of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight build-up of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensation.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incident involving the device shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday objects you need remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal locking hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This allows the backpack to be closed reliably without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with top-down access – you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable risers help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you want to go to Scotland in autumn.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is drawn up, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car through their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers so as not to go bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playstyle with the help of subtle adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates one half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving chariots, pitching tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available promotions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that you can even make a power reserve afloat with the POWER LEVEL controller when it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!

The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its body's own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise disturbances in the breeding process may occur.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be switched back to.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of plumage regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry away from sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble out.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photo things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burn time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« requires neither supply line nor batteries.
Place the »Leuchtstein« in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes ensure a firm grip if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At dusk, »Smart Stone« begins to light up automatically; in which colour, you decide for yourself: In addition to daylight white, you can choose from six attractive light colours.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
The engine control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A variably adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation, especially with bell armature motors – the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder with up to 1.5A motor current provides enough juice even for older motors.

The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work on film sets or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory spaces, simply press one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switched on again - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester installed - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and tough use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitably designed foot is included in this building proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but sonically an exceptionally high level should be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice for broadband bands in order to optimize the bundling that is too high.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then you use a rotary milling cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it hang out there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions turnout Solo 15.
Once the crossover has been installed and the connection terminal is screwed together, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASS reflex opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed in place with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
