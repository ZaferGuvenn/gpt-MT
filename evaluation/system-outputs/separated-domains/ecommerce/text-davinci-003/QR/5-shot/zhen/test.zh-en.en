A certificate that makes sense - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
FYI: First aid is actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency aid.
If I were to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes, the golden four minutes, to save my life!
So it's important to know first aid around you!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
"In China, we have official data that three million people die from accidents every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
Nationally in the US, 15% on average can be saved.
In the casino hotels of Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founding fathers of the First Reaction said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to have any chance of saving someone.
I find that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it's too late when something happens, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
It might even save a life!
First aid certificates can be obtained at your local Red Cross training centre; I got mine at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai, with a student discount.
PS: The last picture is of goals to be achieved before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, I plan to take a diving certificate, before I saw on Little Red Book there is also a diving first aid certificate, to take this certificate seems to have to have a first aid certificate, so in fact the first aid certificate is still very useful!

Inspection of Well Concrete Module Production and Processing Equipment Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment Features and Advantages:
Yixin Check Well Brick Machine Equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. of drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooves on all four sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of a well wall is far superior to that of a flat masonry construction.
The modules are hollow structures, and when combined, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are connected. After the core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which serves as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are provided with grooves for transverse and longitudinal reinforcement, and the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
Additionally, inspection wells and drainage wells constructed with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage, etc., and the mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-button touch-type LCD display, monitoring the entire mechanical operation process, realizing the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic transmission and double cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box advances the model box demoulding and rises, the storage box door closes, the automatic conveying pallet, all completes independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieves the reduction of the mechanical wear and tear and the maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, sealing parts, hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table line cutting and molding are weldless, so that the filler box can be freely guided to reduce mechanical wear to the fullest.
Reduce the mold load, fillers and two-in-one encryption amplitude, adopt integration, full synchronization, table vibration, mold vibration, to ensure the vibration solid effect.
The mechanical vibrator of the well wall module is mechanically vibrated, and the amplitude is automatically controlled by the computer according to the cost performance of the raw material, and the wear-free braking is adopted to prolong the service life and reduce the cost.
The well wall module has both mechanical automatic control and manual control functions.

After considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, I finally made the tough decision and it works well, the dust in the house is obviously much less, but it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; wet mopping needs to be improved, there will be dust marks when taking off; overall I am still very satisfied.

No more fear of being burned by hot oil, no more fear of overcooking or undercooking food due to poor temperature control.
The stir-fried dish tasted much better than what I made; the tomato and egg stir-fry was especially flavourful, and the eggs had a great texture.
This pot was a good buy.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering of fresh olives to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
With a delightful taste and a delicate floral aroma, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavour, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and colour, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden yellow colour.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from pomace by solvent extraction.
Having seen the grading classification, you should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
It should be noted that olives, like grapes for winemaking, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best places for olive tree growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive growth, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others with similar climates, as well as far-south countries such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Months for harvesting olives:
From March to June each year is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for harvesting the fruit (freshness is key for olive oil).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.

Actually, there are many considerations for dressing for girls who are slightly overweight.
A girl with a fuller figure should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be just above the knee, covering the fuller part of the thigh.
Skirts that are too short will reveal fat on the legs.
Being too tall gives the impression of being short and stout.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - top, skirt and long socks - in different colours, it will create a slimming effect and make you look taller.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and a noble and elegant black skirt is the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are very full, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more mainstream the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid drawing attention to your legs and feet, give the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or fishnet tights (the kind with small holes) should be worn. Choose a soft, printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the flaws of a chubby girl.
Of course, there is a certain finesse to dressing a petite girl in a short skirt.
For a plus-size girl wearing a skirt, choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will give the effect of increasing your height with your plus-size figure.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the hottest look of the summer!
If you are an MM with a top-heavy body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your assets.
A-line skirts are slimming and are better suited for plus-size girls; tops should be more fitted to create a layered look that is more slimming.
A simple white t-shirt paired with a skirt is something that even plus-sized women can try.
Petite girls can also dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls can be the focus of everyone's attention.
In addition to changes in clothing combinations, exercise more in life and strive to get out of the label of "slightly fat girl" earlier😄

The new machine is very good.
Good performance stability, four exhaust outlets for cooling with no problems, highly recommended.
This Acer Shadow Knight laptop is great, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The Acer Predator Dragon is still not too expensive in terms of price.
I personally think the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and I can play most games with a high frame rate.

I'm really happy with the laptop I bought; it's mainly for design and has great value for money. It's lighter than I expected and looks better too.

I've been using the Macro Night Knight for two years now and it's been great value for money and of good quality!
I have recommended this product to all my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
It looks good and has good configuration.
I bought something for my nephew and was planning to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit of a shame.
However, the cost performance is quite high and the logistics is quite fast, so let's come back and review it after a while.

He said it was great, the one I bought for my son.
The computer is great, especially with the good customer service attitude. Ask questions if you don't understand and I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.

With the right photographer, you can have wedding photos that rival those of celebrities.
It is important for wedding photography that both the photographer and the makeup artist have an aesthetic sense, and luckily I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I realised that I had been "photo-shopped" too.
Nichang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Quickly served My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Tang". The Mala Tang is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 Those who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
Delicious food, good meat, and friendly service.
It's been a while since I've been to Rishang, and the fruit lao is still so good & the ingredients are plentiful. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time, and it was just the soft floury southern taste I love!
The porridge was cooked to just the right degree of dryness, with a generous portion. The signature tin-foil chicken wings were as good as ever, and the soup was also good. The kale was also well-prepared...
The taste was excellent, the service was friendly, and the meat was good.
The old shop of Ritchang has been a popular spot for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden flooring.
We always had to wait a long time at the entrance for the claypot rice, and the claypot was cracked...
It's been years since I last went to eat at Richeng; the rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
Rarely do you find a restaurant with seating available right away, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The meat is good, the main dishes are great, and the taste is excellent.
Nichiyo Delivery.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three Cup Chicken: The side dishes are a bit too much, and the chicken is a bit too little.
The main seasoning of this dish is a bit off, the salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness, you can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label whisky drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and Red Label Whisky has won a gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you're wasting its smoothness.
So how do you drink Redbreast Whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from around 35 Scotch whiskies, with the full-bodied aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the full-bodied aroma.
The entry is smooth and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky entered the domestic market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Schweppes became a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acidity, can bring pleasure to the eyes, and when added to drinks, they can dilute the taste and change the flavor.
Red Label whisky + slices of lemon + cube sugar (or granulated sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly tart taste, sugar can be added to neutralize the acidity, and lemon will give the drink a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky; everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully this introduction can help everyone.
Mrs. Kim's Bridal Photography (Nam-ro Store) does not currently have any branches.
Before taking the photos, we had to change the time twice because we hadn't arranged it properly, and our consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, a weekend with good weather was chosen for shooting.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I had ever done my makeup properly - wow, I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally check our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt happy after a day of taking photos.
When selecting photos, because I had seen many cases online, I was reluctant to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, just the 24 in the package, not one more (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked and there were two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me to retouch them.
Flipping through the photos my sister took before, I really felt satisfied with our photos; they were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I highly recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady to take wedding photos!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim thanks you sincerely for your wishes and wishes you all happiness and a bright future!

Does a foot bath tub tingle when it is electrically charged?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide range of products have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up, to his surprise he had discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
He later contacted the merchant, who was quite accommodating, but Mr. Li still felt disgruntled despite the return of the footbath.
Because he discovered that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the already popular foot bath in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it was suitable for, and what materials were safe to use.
Generally, footbaths do not have an electrical issue, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been released without proper inspection.
Therefore, choose a freestanding footbath when purchasing.
Hydrogen electrolysis is completely safe.
You can also take a random electric pen test.
Chè, whose real name is Jiang Bo, was born in the year of the sheep and on the grass of the sheep path, so he was called "Sheep Uncle" or "Sheep Shù".
Known in the industry as the "mystery genius" for publishing the "Oriental Code" series of works such as "Thai Strange Tales," "Indian Strange Tales," "Japanese Strange Tales," and "Korean Strange Tales," he self-proclaims to be "good at talking nonsense seriously."
Under the Lamp, also known as Chinese Strange Tales, "Mystery Genius" Yang Xian brings you a brand new work Under the Lamp to deeply appreciate the essence of Chinese folk customs. What kind of sad and moving love-hate songs are behind those legends that have been passed down to this day?
"Wayfarers" Nan Xiaolou and Yue Wu Hua embark on another death-defying exploration, and their origins are about to be revealed.

Thank you for choosing our product. Please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following before using our chip:
Please check that all items are present and correct upon opening the box.
Please contact customer service if there are any missing items.
The cover plate on the microfluidic chip is made of PC material; do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a hand-pushed syringe to directly inject into the chip, as leakage may occur.
Standard base microfluidic chips are tested with pure water at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure prior to shipment.
Chips on glass substrates are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) inlet pressure before shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using chips on glass substrates, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution when using and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage will occur.
For microfluidic chips with a common base, we suggest a flow rate setting of below 150ul/min when using a syringe pump with pure water for sample injection, and a flow rate setting of below 50ul/min for the oil phase.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid and increase your flow rate parameters from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels of the universal chip in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for long periods of time.
No refunds or exchanges will be given if the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation.
If you need microfluidic chips that can withstand higher pressures or flow rates, contact customer service for customization.
The normal delivery period for chips is within one week, and some in-stock items can be shipped within 24 hours after ordering. Please consult with customer service before ordering.
If you have any questions about how to connect our chip to the sample loading system, you can refer to the link https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/60474873, or search for the "Jieguan Shengke" public account for more help.

Member Reviews
Photo effect: Took two sets of clothes overall not bad, like this set of pictures ~
[Service] Service Details: Because I was feeling a bit uncomfortable while pregnant with makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and kept giving me hot water to drink.
Suite Price: 1000 Yuan
Thank you Rabbit for your review. Originally you said that the ancient style was not suitable for ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great - I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production was impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match a makeup look suitable for your style, using only top-brand cosmetics.
As for Teacher Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio had an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats for company.
We were working in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had taken photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, and this is true for most people; photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-oiled team.
We and everyone around us were all full of praise for the finished product.
I had recommended the place to my friend and she was equally delighted after seeing the negatives.
Hoping that such studios won't be buried, that more people will discover them and shoot in their own style, not in a cookie-cutter way.
Many thanks to Jan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both are very creative newcomers and we are a creative studio. We will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
The sweet and caring assistant, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, thank you all 😘😘
Thank you for the comments from Little Universe. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you all. I'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play again if I have the chance.

Initially it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as they arrived at the store.
When I first went to the store, I just showed them my floor plan and they didn't even measure the house. They were able to give me a quote of 70,000 for my 135 sqm house. They showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that they will drag you into the store and make you pay a deposit (which you will never get back unless you have enough experience to fight them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This was a big scam and I was a living example of being duped, paying a deposit of more than ten thousand in a moment of impulse.
His quote to me had a lot of issues - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to get my money back they were very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
The customers are in no way to blame for the problem of biting down no matter what.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and a lot of details, don't want to say all are tears, in short don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees afterwards.
Damn, they were the original scamming head decorations, now they changed to Da Mei, it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decorating company.
In the future, everyone should do more research and consult more when choosing, because decorating is not a small expense.
To ask a merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Posting of any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited; please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.

Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Select Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding her on WeChat to book a date, the lady sent me a list of available times and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the shop's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling~ The photographer would arrange some props, guide the actions, and be very meticulous about the details before taking the photos.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should look nice 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the post-production style, and feel very attentive.
It will take about half a month to fix the film, so wait and see the results~
I won the second photography-themed grand prize event~ most of the clothes in the venue could be chosen for a photo shoot.
She finally chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer was my younger brother from the post-95s generation, who felt a bit inexperienced. I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
The Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores for reply.
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too!
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose the clothes, including wedding dresses. They were very patient when I tried on three or four sets. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, when taking photos, they taught me how to pose. The only problem was that the photos made my face look too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received them in three or four days and there was no difference from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are about three makeup positions inside the photography studio.
The service was very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also teach you poses very seriously.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
Experience: The shaping may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
Eyebrows were also shaved off, which was a bit awkward for daily life without eyebrows.
The photos were given ten days later, but the effect of the double eyelid stickers was not very satisfactory, it still felt very obvious.
Not sure what style to go for, I tried two sets, but in the end I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and the editor said he would have the finished product within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfying~

The surroundings weren't great, there were few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food at the restaurants was just okay.
