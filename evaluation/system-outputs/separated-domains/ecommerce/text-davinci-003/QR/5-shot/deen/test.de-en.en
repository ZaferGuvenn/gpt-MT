The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a single circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the scales H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker with sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He is proficient in the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register at a suitable digital control center.
He masters all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read on the main track with suitable central units.
For central controllers that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow for the triggering of 16 functions.
An integrated programming mode makes reprogramming possible even with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration to mfx®-compatible hubs.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with direct current is also possible.
Furthermore, he also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum automatic system allows for automatic shuttling between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railway systems.

Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, providing low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you're ready to go.
The water pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the water pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, so that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the package services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really tough time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone will keep one light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp is proven to be suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In a snowy environment, its light looks even better - only with a shorter lighting duration should be expected when the days are shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the functioning of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the standard Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery through our online shop and extend the life of your decorative light even further.

NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the feather loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Modelleisenbahner ME Magazine 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 about the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment potential of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 which were available in larger quantities were preferred for assembly.
Only when it became apparent that the reprocessing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, did the E 95 come into focus for reprocessing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As age increased, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the fireman who was constantly on board this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors was frequent and led to months of outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed internally in 1986.
The locomotive is being preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, with the transformers checked and five drive motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their efficient drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive needs to be done by the buyer, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inner side of the components which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back and forth swiping with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark colors could show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks if it mixes with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models: Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is taking your time, being patient, and having a steady hand when applying stickers.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal onto the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Warning: Always check that the picture is properly aligned before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or tear.
Wipe away excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
The LokSound 5 Decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.

To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-error free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
These specifications only apply to exact conditions that rarely match the conditions of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, please refer to the "Technical Data" table (See user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated use.
Make sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion is placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.

If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be machine washed at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, remain well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
The closure flap has a metal clasp with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior space (more on that below) and easily store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics which are specific to certain windows and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that is aligned with the balancing of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The windows produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car through attractive and striking looks.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneering colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the auctioneer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped in foil) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.

If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are no pressure marks.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier plays a major role in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even provide a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when making direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally get yourself a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live performance.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!

Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the dive computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
The bird breaks down the protein taken in with the feed in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and then builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the renewal of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this course of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the start of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely up to date with the latest sound technology.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp, of course.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp is primarily responsible for the tube-like character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
The decorative light harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Glowstone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you decide the color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start again the next day.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved significantly.
A variable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation especially for bell-type armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power even for older motors.

The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances, is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Operating with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The assembly of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking levers on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a matching designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight high-frequency boost.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an unparalleled dynamic range.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front, and bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
The following steps are marking and pre-drilling (2.5-mm drill bit) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leave it sticking out about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
By using the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
