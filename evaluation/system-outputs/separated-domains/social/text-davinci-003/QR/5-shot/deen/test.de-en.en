I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a look, just help out, just bring the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it's OK with him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately forces the patients to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the general plot and I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
I received an invitation to a meeting via email today.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
He changed to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Help with First Campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the further action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the option to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Negotiating, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears will stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing over the season, so I'm making this post to vent a bit.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start crash put the schedule far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!)
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
In addition, there are constant antics that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Surprisingly, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So, in any case, the fantastic F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I of course had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study until my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear about great career opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of college in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Weekend Breaks
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax and unwind.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems like it's also available before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... why because?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been too long and that can't be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed hostage situation due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know this in the north too?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing to pay.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet claim them with the private health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the room here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly constitutes a low-budget film.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
God has set all this in motion, as far as I'm concerned.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
We don't need to have a discussion here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan which received and sent 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module that broadcasts the wifi does not receive the full 500 anymore, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less it receives (so using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe some other people feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also suffering from a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having a tummy ache right now, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do homework, which we obviously have to divide up.
But even cooking is just too much work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm doing okay.
Not great, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently asking a lot of me; I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and I should at least prepare a bit for the anatomy class the day after tomorrow.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on and on.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams without it.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I'd find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening anyway, the week is almost done!
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious studies teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always seemed strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed it.
What do you think about it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope my question is not too personal.
Help with Movie Search Please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If this rings a bell to you, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take a lot more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A generic advertising channel trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up again despite the power adapter being plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible, as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
What you are describing is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however u/Nitemarex had none by definition.**
I misread your comment.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got lots of great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I'm getting the taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
It's time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the German Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I used to think that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was becoming disgruntled, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan you get quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
Thanks for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into any more detail than that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, however, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people on the right are naturally attracted to uniforms and weapons, and that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality. Of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them and tries to do right by them, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there. However, it is completely exaggerated by the media that these people are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain like-minded people meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that's a good thing in my opinion that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Neater through child?
Hi, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and then and then I get motivated and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case "that someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because I don't have much motivation for it, it doesn't bother me too much as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your replies.
Career in Social Work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The code review process is already causing problems for me (emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Also submitted a petition to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
The by-laws explicitly list the walnut tree as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately just okay, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and I was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'm googling other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and finish at least the sketch, after that I can always switch direction.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the PhD I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even a family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally it's fun and from the outside it looks like the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can tell that everything is kind of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least somewhat clear.
Pill Problem
Hello ladies!
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
As for my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne all over my body when I took my last two-year break from 0 to 100.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to wait for the dermatologist appointment.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to a chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy, and low meat diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It could also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have problems everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else could be wrong.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for tutorials, etc.).
When I'm planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am mostly dissatisfied with the most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions During the Christmas Season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have secured the day of St. Nicholas and are taking this opportunity to focus on family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at your home back then?
How about with your partner?
Do you want to pass your traditions on to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
Shoe-shining?
Baking cookies?
Decorating a tree?
Is music being played?
Is the Christmas present from Santa, the Christ Child, or from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone puts in effort and makes an effort to have it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas.
Whether it's traditional or something different every year: tell us how it works in your family!
The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely finished, it will then continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a specific person (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does this go with the vaccination..").
My responsibilities include educating people about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor present, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Tire selection for road racing - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire was not willing to continue the rest of the journey at all.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
The weather wasn't too bad, so maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really rather not have this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of driving, then I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€/tire just to be disappointed in the end.
I'm also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that have this feature (apparently?), but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD based on my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
