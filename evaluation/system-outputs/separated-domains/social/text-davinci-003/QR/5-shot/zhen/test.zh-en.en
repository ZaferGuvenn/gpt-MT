To conclude, I personally believe that Four Seas is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say the movie isn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, from the kind that make you fall asleep in the theater to the kind that make you angry after watching. For the audience, Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei, able to ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting his audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like the windbreaker on Little Horse's back.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find it's just a pile of crap.
To start off, I'm having a hard time understanding some of the plot points.
The male protagonist lives on a small island somewhere in the south with his grandmother, depending on her for his livelihood.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighbourhood to take her in a small van to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people taking a bus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were very relieved about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
How were the Island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road and the drivers of the trucks around could not be found.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a delinquent and criminally-suspected biker become a police officer?
In the movie, why didn't the person facing the usury report it to the police, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key, and then forces themselves to sleep outside the room door when they can't find the hotel manager?
This nonsensical plot was pervasive throughout the film, and I find myself in pain when I recall it due to its absurdity.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, was the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which was an ugly patchwork of nothingness.
At the beginning of the film you think it's going to be a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it could be a story about how hard it is to survive as a small-town youth, and after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep suspicion of yourself for why you went to the cinema to watch crap over the holidays.
For most people, the tropes of various types of movies are also very familiar. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romance movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(Like the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character got burned and then still managed to sing), you can't go opening some Kennedy-unbearable brain holes.
As for the female lead clearly not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I'm also quite curious as to why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file meant to give the audience a headache?
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out!

I want to try tennis but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something similar at a similar price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices often correlate with friendliness, and if you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones; these "entry-level" ones are actually industrial junk.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't take it, and it's difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext behind them is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy something expensive, so let's give you a cheap one to fool you, you'll play it twice and then never play again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have progressed; then come back to me and buy the expensive stuff, and I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200. Isn't it great to enjoy a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is a letdown after the beginner stage, but most people, especially women, cannot get past the beginner stage.

What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Also Win Gold Medals in the Olympics" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can be absolutely first-class in many projects, and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
A seemingly jokey article also speaks to the daily struggles of project managers, representing a sense of frustration with the current state of project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging by the increasing number of applicants for the PMP (Project Management Professional certification) each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing year by year in the past decade, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
But does passing the PMP guarantee smooth sailing for project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project dragging on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor cross-departmental assistance and communication, making it difficult for the project to move forward...
Therefore, having focused on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D personnel such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It has brought the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
The R&D Project Manager Bootcamp Online Course is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods from R&D-type enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the path of advanced project management.
It is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, resulting in efficient operational outcomes for the business.
To get an idea of what other students think of the course, here is what they say: The course is not only taught by the experts from Zhongtianhua-Xia (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many real business scenarios from well-known enterprises to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.
Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust in New Town!
The car we have brought to you as a team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Priced at nearly two million ringgit, with road tax of tens of thousands of ringgit per year and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while it takes my Myvi to reach 30km/h, it takes them to reach 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Not much needs to be said about the model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, so uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool).
A kilometer of petrol costs around RM1 (drivers don't really care).
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise was so loud that you would be temporarily deafened when you got off (but it was still awesome).
The car is too big and it will be too narrow to park in a regular parking spot, I'm afraid it will get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one else on the road. (This is something I said, not the driver, haha!)
Don't be mistaken, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Involving a car crash worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be familiar to car enthusiasts; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, foreign cars crashed a million dollar 911 and a million dollar Chiron in just a few minutes!
As it turns out, you were right!
As NFTs were quickly leaving the scene, the crypto community was coming up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-raising game with a variety of playstyles, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with over $3 billion in transactions to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue is over 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The success of Axie Infinity has spread the new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts allowing players to not only gain enjoyment and economic rewards from the game, but also to participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This agency is not granted by the game makers, but is instead secured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing a news article about my friend's stock was the choice of track for the enterprise, i.e. the choice of investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics is about "doing the things right," or doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and most tactical thinking has space for strategic thinking.
Thinking beyond how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to deepen in the current field or expand into other fields (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking), one can consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; thinking beyond how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin welcomed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, the first time Bitcoin has been a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From a blockchain technology development perspective, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In the same month, after negotiating the details of the factory purchase with the family of the property owner, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer double; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the house sale contract being delayed in signing.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, putting down a deposit, and preparing the payment, Mr. Lu was left frustrated and angry when the seller refused to sign the contract at the last minute.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court for this.
The court found, after hearing the case, that the parties had ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the fault could not be attributed solely to the defendant; it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, and thus the case should not be subject to the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract.
After the first judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
[Legal Notice] Necessary due diligence must be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the ownership information of the house and whether the house is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
You are Zheng Mian, and this is your second week in Japan.
You were walking down the street when you suddenly noticed someone following you, and you started to walk faster and faster out of fear until you began to run.
The person behind you shouted, "Miss! Please wait!" You stopped in your tracks at the entrance of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director, I think you're very beautiful, would you be interested in taking part in a reality show?"
You are suspicious and afraid that this is a scam.
He gave you a business card and you realised he was really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If you have time, Miss, we can talk at the company and of course there will be a fee."
You stumbled into the company with him, and he said he saw you on the street and was very eager for you to join.
You thought there was no harm and you could make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large dating reality show, divided into two parts.
The early stages involve having celebrities and ordinary people interact in real life to foster rapport.
Later they will enter the game together to complete the levels.
With official recording starting next week, you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen?
Upon seeing the following article, why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning from a business and preservation perspective, although canning is deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder factories and interacted with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So you might be wondering: why is the shelf life of a bagged product one year, while the shelf life of a canned product is two years or longer?
Or ask: why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, out of this mentality, eat and then react saying that the taste or flavor of the canned product is different!
Now I will tell everyone why the hearing aid is expensive, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then how can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a large increase in their pricing of hearing aids to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to promote tin packaging rather than bag packaging.
And you think so many manufacturers spend hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this money come from?
As one can imagine.
As society develops, so too do the costs of marketing, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product giveaways, and advertising costs.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening devices, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose was to gain higher profits, even though their raw material costs would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to unscrupulous means and link up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, taking a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such operations, and in fact this practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any effect on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food; if the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
I just read an article about menstruation and it was too long.
A little bit of male education for the uninitiated.
Most girls experience their first period suddenly one day between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards it will come regularly every month, provided the body is healthy.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately; there's a margin of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to come earlier (sometimes several days earlier).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with 24 hours of bleeding over a few days from start to finish; the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and furniture.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but taking it after the cramps start won't be of much use.
Due to excessive uterine engorgement and prostaglandin release before labor, diarrhea is common.
If it's around the time of your period and you have sudden stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Cotton swabs do not need to be changed frequently; they should be changed every five to six hours, at most every eight hours.
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation can also make one's mood unstable, making it a bit of a bummer when the body trips itself up.
But official crime statistics show that women have a high ability to control their emotions and are not likely to use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, but also shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is at its thinnest, then gradually thickens; it can be understood as the uterus being a house, building it (the endometrium thickening) each month to prepare for a guest, if the guest doesn't come, it is all taken down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, bleeding for several days and 24 hours a month, plus abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But a person is able to be born because his mother has menstruated, which is to prepare the house for you to stay in for 10 months when you first come to this world, so everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things for women were previously suppressed, society brainwashed women to think it was dirty, shameful, and that it was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting, finds the preparation of a female body for the creation of life disgusting, and says so in public, girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and never will, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton strips, they're really good.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental branch of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji era.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of which terms represent real existing entities and which terms represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by naturalistic concepts, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism is a research method that does not make any assumptions about the existence of God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and thinking about human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behaviour accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong actions).
It studies what kind of moral behaviour people should follow) , applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theory, but from the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, all the moral factors that prompt these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have provided over the past 30 years since the death of our family members, especially since I first issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families of their own.
It was your kindness that helped our families in distress get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have been brought to a perfect conclusion long ago.
I will always remember your love and I am sure your deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in their 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds, called "Tiananmen Mothers".
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which ran for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund," which has been running ever since.
The funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations from the year of the Tiananmen Square incident, from generous individual donations, and with the support of the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Square incident.
During this time, China Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donations was out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired and not as well-off as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
Thanks and respect are due to those brave and generous comrades who have risked their lives for years to deliver humanitarian aid with open hearts.
A programming novice who wants to share their experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you're planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a great option, especially for those with weak self-discipline; training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if it is not strong enough, then the training institution is not of much use, of course some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm actually not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation, and learning this subject has a lot to do with the individual's own circumstances.
Things like profession, age, language to be learnt, and even which city, all have a bearing on what you are learning or want to pursue as a career.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer professional who has graduated, then I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time; this is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays there are many offline and online training institutions which are also very good, but they have a high cost of learning and require a lot of time to invest, usually requiring 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-learning is very convenient. There are many learning resources on the Internet now, which are free, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some classic books that can be used in conjunction with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions now sign employment agreements with internal referral quotas, recommending students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
These are my thoughts; as I don't know your situation, I can only give a general introduction and not a detailed one. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I undertake all kinds of installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall-mounted stove water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional beauty stitching, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me likes, life is hard but we must continue to strive for it. Life is tiring but we must keep going.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, so follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going, the road can be looked back on but not walked back on...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
As cleaners, we do the dirtiest work, but we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My Daily Work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services helps you do "clean" what I can, serve the family.
Keep the family clean, set up a family governance monument, serve in place, clean to the family.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time they will become dull and lose their light; only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance, just like life.
Success comes from doing with heart, and refinement comes from doing with detail; we take our sewing seriously.
Give me a chance and I will make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is to be trusted, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough out there in all industries right now!
But I always believed that as long as I had the right attitude, was persistent and worked hard, I would be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day well begun is half done; all good things start in the morning. May you start the new day with joy, luck, health, and good fortune. Have a good day and keep a good mood all day. Good morning!
As a child, happiness was something to have; as an adult, happiness was a goal to reach; as a mature person, happiness was found to be a state of mind to be understood.
Be the truest and best version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life to the fullest!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Although the right-wing has had successful periods in history, they have not lasted long; they are like flowers that bloom in the sun and sweat when given a sip of water; they are easily elated when successful and quickly discouraged when faced with defeat.
But realistically, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of government and protecting human rights should not be denied.
For me, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I take his words seriously and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I opposed his anti-communist theories, as I believed that anti-necessity revolutions would inevitably lead to social unrest, harm the people's livelihood, and a mix of political groups, followed by foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people; those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists are actually a bunch of outcasts from the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyse their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with anti-rebels and refuting Leftists, and they were quite emotional. I think there's no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics; they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the anti-revolutionaries and the left-wingers to admit it - why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent piece and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them so obsessively that they become distorted.
As ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth may become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom; China's innate historical and cultural genes lead to the overall tendency of leaning left in China.
The right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness and security.
Now society as a whole is looking for more fairness, and the Sino-US rivalry is definitely leaning left, likely to continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up and be done with it.
Without saying a word, Flower-Flower was so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US's suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries to impose a blockade on our chip industry, has directly resulted in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and phone prices rising, with almost all industries using chips suffering the consequences.
In order to gain control of the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to form a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US technology giants, such as Intel, an old American technology giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Investing $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opening up chip contract manufacturing business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to snatch away TSMC's "rice bowl".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is sure to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Intel's decision was met with disdain by TSMC founder Morris Chang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was so dismissive of Intel's foray into the semiconductor field because he still harbored resentment from the feud between TSMC and Intel over 30 years ago.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of American manufacturing, occupying the pinnacle of the global market and dominating the world semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chips designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model put a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs had to back away from the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to see division of labour and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specialising in chip design, he thought that since there were companies specialising in design, then it would be possible to set up a factory specialising in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
TSMC targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing," providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time, newly-founded TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognised that Intel had a disdain for semiconductor fabrication services at the time.
Surprisingly, the giants that once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel was entering the semiconductor foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Let's take a look at some weird trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Good Friends Price Increase, Huolala Incident, public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [index decreases] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look identical to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China had previously displayed.
What is abnormal sentiment?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, a [solitary peak], [sawtooth], and [cliff] shape is presented.
"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to get into the hot search list and attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in a single glance: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuned operations, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Public relations is a science, and without taking into account any subjective factors such as position or emotion, it is impossible to hide from the objective data.
Everyone leaves a trace, and we will dig out these traces together.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television the OP mentioned should refer to LCD TVs, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or rather, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting user demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales for 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, the sales of laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The success of laser TVs in the big-screen market is mainly due to their excellent performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The CECST Standardization Research Institute's SaeXi Laboratory and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In an increasingly vision-conscious world, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye-protection advantages, but have also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
That makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, laser TVs have a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection equipment, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with minimal space needed and a small, compact host that takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, top-brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less wear and tear on the equipment, and longer life of the television.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, in terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, microstructured FEP screens are used, at a high cost; an 80-inch one is basically the price of a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing I really hate is when projector manufacturers use "good for the eyes" as a selling point for diffusion. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling lit up too?
Furthermore, the projection screen fabric would not be able to form an image if it were not diffusely reflective.
It was precisely the hot-spot (glare) effect of the high-gain screen that was overlooked, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that was really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violation records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent; in summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) for insurance companies and banks, and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Rain Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Rain Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it is still good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel salaries, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
It is worth considering.
In terms of professionalism of the salesperson: this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims issues and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Weibao" (like Little Umbrella, an internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsibly telling everyone.
Insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners in the internet channel, and there is a lot of sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
The insurance company paid out 6 million (a world of free money) for a one-dollar bet.
Free mobile phones were only given to policy numbers with special endings such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message was sent out, no one would remind you to redeem it if you didn't.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term, if only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if a serious illness really occurs, 60,000 can do what, can not solve the problem, the future life begins to be naked.
Misleading internet insurance sales are currently being cracked down on by the government.
So, overall, the platform is fine, the product is fine, it's the professionalism and professional conduct of the salespeople that is the issue.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully, as many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for customers. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Growing with each customer for life.
I hope my answer was helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although taking out insurance online may lack the "ceremony" of it, and may not even involve a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal force of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat akin to a "telephone sales" assembly line approach, can have a fatal flaw when it comes to buying insurance: follow-up service may not keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, so when we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider if the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate anything, but this kind of villainy must be stopped.
If we set aside party and faction, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to the posts with sarcastic comments, to your attempts to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me in a subtle and humiliating way on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether to plant strawberries in bed or not. I... just forget it.
Later I received messages from several friends about your Facebook account with a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment content.
Sorry, as a woman I can no longer stay silent.
After my news report was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your making of the picture or continue to post all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, and do not have the power to stop you.
I neither know nor want to know you, and my looks and figure do not need your criticism.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those without basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I have cut some of the comments for everyone to review.
No one should be able to impersonate you on posts you make yourself.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Break into a smile.
US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Strongest Weapon Rarely Visits Guam - Multi-dimensional Chinese Communist Media Multi-dimensional Report: Latest news on US-China relations: Latest satellite images show three US carriers gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visits Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform," a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9th.
The Balabac Strait, connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic stronghold in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea aboard the USS Carl Vinson.
This was the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
The US Navy carrier currently cruising the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried the first F-35C carrier squadron, belonging to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser USS Shoup, the missile destroyer USS Stockdale, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing three US aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Rare Visit to Guam with Most Powerful Weapons On January 17, 2022, US Navy carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception).
The USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base at Guam last Saturday (January 15th).

This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US Three-Carrier Strike Group Makes Rare Visit to Guam Near China, With Most Powerful Weapons - China has been building up a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the "Boomers" the "most important survivable leg of the nuclear triad," which also included launch silos for ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that could carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, with a market cap evaporating of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that they are "facing unprecedented competition," what could be the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue primarily coming from advertising. It is a money-making advertising company today, with its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, whatever the functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustments to its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow an app to access their information; most people's normal reaction would be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it is there).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta receives at least 10% of its revenue annually from China, mainly from companies doing business in the country.
Meta has around a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets often find that Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, burning most of their money on Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte just two years ago.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale is now over.
Third, the expansion of new channels of traffic was not successful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets look not only at current income but also at future expectations.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were not met.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "metaverse".
The metaverse should certainly be a direction of the future, but the realization of the metaverse is a longer-term story that is unlikely to support Meta's valuation over the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success and annual revenues of $10-20 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at the company, with no real safe harbour compared to other internet and tech companies.
Although his several social media apps now have high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand unified universe was so far out of reach that success in the short term was completely out of the question, making Facebook a very risky venture. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues was wrong and was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
