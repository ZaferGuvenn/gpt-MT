In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy on his own for a short time and he's OK with it, that's good.
You can judge for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
Legally speaking, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is of course up to you;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't think of the title anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going to his big cats' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets into his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats fearful patients.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is hired anonymously before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients end up facing their fears in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to her death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Child, 4 y., splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outside) along the entire length.
Tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she is from a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to trample an official's feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we cannot help them.
I'm well aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help with that in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
He switched to a company he slandered about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Apparently he didn't sew himself into his old place and looked for something else.
You can too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Help with your first own campaign
Greetings Boron!
I'm currently leading the adventure Across the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly take my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further plot should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be luring the heroes into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If you don't notice, the goblins lurk in a hollow path for the heroes and flank the carriage, armed with bows to each left and right, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If there is a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village shoulder, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think the deus ex machina of solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much as a start to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm guaranteed to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, however, F1 takes precedence for legal reasons and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was again ignorance of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I believe that you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay TV station.
It's also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or required by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like RTL's Heiko Wasser better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out lap Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two broadcasters also do less advertising in training than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of reruns.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Apart from the advertising, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and standing in the laboratory doesn't bother me either (I've already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also found out about career prospects before I started my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely like to and will study until I finish my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, and I am particularly depressed about the job prospects.
On the one hand (study check, etc.) you keep hearing about great job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) What do you currently work as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking of dropping out of my studies and training to be an IT specialist in 2022.
If you have any experiences, please let me know:)
Extra stress before holidays & bank holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that there is also one before public holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was Assumption Day, which is called "Ascension Day" in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses have a bridging day on Friday, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend coming up last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to be sent out before Ascension, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-indulgence about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can't really treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.
My question is simple: is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured case"?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing with PKV, it suddenly gets in the way.
In turn:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the PKV in advance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically we bill the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the group here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for exactly what a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films on the Internet, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what maybe you don't like at all?
Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will admit their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set it all in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just spouting nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
We don't need to have discussions about the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat grilled on a rotating spit.
And that's why both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately I now have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrive on the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, but the further away I go in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That's why I would be all the more happy to get an answer.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one or the other feels the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 in 1 my child.
My friend (together since 6 years) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged wg burns).
On top of that, he is cold and we see each other less (1-2x a week) at the moment, which bothers me a lot with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and mother and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which of course we split up.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently being adjusted quite well, I have been treated reasonably well and am coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, does the whole thing continue?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I won't get it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that partly has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would definitely find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Something completely different: I discovered at school back then that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that for them it was just another subject like math or geography.
It was always a bit strange for me, maybe also because I was brought up as a Christian and I always somehow believed that way.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
Is there a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Maintaining culture or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a plot emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live myself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end both soldiers fight each other I think.
If that tells you something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive:D
Relax yourself.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around you is right, no stuffed animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the stomach?
Or is it face first right in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was commonplace to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the politics of this station are now worse than anything else.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running advertising pillar."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising station trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that exploded.
How are you supposed to find all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
Nothing, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD media library
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared on my Twitter timeline today and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a heated debate about education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never! be about power over the child for us parents and other responsible persons.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common, seeing images is less common and perception of pain is the least common.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthetic is avoided to protect the child up to the umbilical cord.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthetic preliminary interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **didn't have any by definition.
I misread your comment.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that:)
Now I've got a taste for it and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will prepare a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
It's time for change
###MBundestag Greetings, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We got into a hibernation and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are still really interested in the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and, to put it simply, found a heap of rubble.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that's not a bad thing, we end up with the Discord.
If you have the time and inclination, join the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself used to live vegetarian for a while, and currently probably rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking too much.
Namely, that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without relying on them.
Greetings from a harmony loving vegan (;
First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar job, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Basically, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, people to the right of conservatives are magically attracted to people in particular in uniforms and weapons carriers, and that these people then naturally find it difficult to deal with the lived reality. Of course it is also clear, because in addition to the average white person, you now have many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine clichéd gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive branch, but completely normal men and women who you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also on these people I can and have to rely on them, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But these fringe groups also represent a conservative attitude, even if it sounds strange at first in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less taken up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks they are right to do, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since the police and armed forces are of course also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wing people there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Tidyer by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed, very little free time), but throughout my life I've had a hard time keeping my household clean and tidy permanently.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never really like "someone could come visit spontaneously."
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it does bother me somewhere, but mostly household simply loses out against work and disinclination.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more tidy with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as there is no visitor and z. b. fresh clothes are always there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have now studied for about a year.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this job is not the right one for me, which is why I've been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxiety-avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a matter-of-fact level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family support, for example.
But I don't know if the specific everyday work is really what I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("still screwed up the simplest things") and I find it difficult for more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really poor" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it at the time.
Statement of a community employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm doing the ref right now as a career changer.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more precise here).
But then the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up becoming a teacher and I was sure that was it - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
The times before that I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can still switch.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time over the past month that I'm completely drained.
It's vacation time now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my end of work was my end of work.
I was free then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the ref is also doing well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it shuts down completely - if it's not already doing so.
I'm wondering if I want it to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I'm reading some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, take my free time when I needed it, and although I found the work kind of boring, I was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if in a year I won't have come back to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You notice that everything is kind of confused, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year of reddit.
About my problem: About five years ago I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shit PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that alone because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I got explosive pimples from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it burdened me a lot and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me that seriously and a dermatologist's appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had bad atopic dermatitis in advance, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodule lichen and the acne issue.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and got stuck on a mixed diet of sugar, milk and low meat because nothing else worked really well.
It may also be that hormonally the worm is in it, but if, like me, you have construction sites everywhere, you'd rather not go looking for anything else that goes wrong.
Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been at the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every hour actually stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
Would be really happy.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we got hold of St. Nicholas Day and are taking this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was that at your house back then?
As with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The boot cleaning?
Baking cookies?
Decorate the tree?
Is there music?
Is Santa Claus coming, the Christ Child or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort at and around Christmas to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are fixed traditions or even something different every year: tell us how it worked or works in your family!
The title says it all, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, I will then continue in some cases in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I'm taking medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes providing information about the vaccination, the indication (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of an allergic reaction (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any with us, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who cannot (may?) carry out vaccinations, so I carry out most of the vaccinations there myself.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
No sooner said than done and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then something happened that lurks in every downtown area (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to go along with the rest of the route.
Since I didn't have a real opportunity to get a spare jacket and spare hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't all that bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route ahead of me over several days, I would extremely hate to get this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't that bad, because the previous owner also had the old tires (very nice old man, ripped off 120 km on the day I came to pick up the bike by 2 p.m.!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he rode with them for many years.
But when I think about having to change tires after 80-90kms driving, I think I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) those on the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Lay people rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are organizing the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per button, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we will do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
