Basically, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes take a quick look, sometimes help briefly, sometimes bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this suits your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours as he falls asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, at your discretion;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but I don't want to think of the title anymore maybe someone here knows about it...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his big cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, comes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
This confrontation with fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Child, 4 y., splinter under thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
Tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent off an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by e-mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick any official's feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something a bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
I (21) come into frequent contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can not be helped or think we could not help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
He has moved to a company about which he has blasphemed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Help with your first own campaign
Greetings to Boron!
I'm currently leading the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought up and now I'm about to write the entry adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further plot should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabres
If not noticed, the goblins lurk the heroes in a hollow path and flank the cart armed with three bows on the left and right, while two with spears stop the cart.
Should it come to battle and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village schoolboy, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this same half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely heed many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives again.
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, F1 takes precedence for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again ignorance of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork, what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that make both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over Sky, in the run-out lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the terrific F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject itself quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely like to and will study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought-after, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and may be considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and training as an IT specialist.
If you have experience, feel free to write them :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems that it also exists before holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was Assumption Day, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies make a bridging day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *necessarily* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be?
Or because people in all seriousness want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What's the point of this self-hostage because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't treat ourselves properly?!
Mind you, the stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent on it.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Fertility treatment for private health insurance / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone
We were for some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, this suddenly stands in the way.
In order:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and got the commitment for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the assumption of costs at the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has this to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are just as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God got the whole thing going.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just tapping nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the Fritz Box 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrives (ie use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, with the new fiber optic connection, the Internet is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one - or the other feels the same way...
I am 24, have kPTSD, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
On top of that, he is cold and we currently see each other less (1-2x week) which makes me very difficult with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework to us, which of course we divide.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently quite well adjusted, I am reasonably well treated and cope.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll grab it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
What do you think about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can withstand much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the stomach?
Or is it face first Directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
To be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station is now under all the sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a running advertising column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is enough for operation.
Wrong, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in the power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when plugged in?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images and least often to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the cord is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the preliminary anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
Have misread her comment.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
This was available for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender as butter!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I got a taste for it and would like to cook roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set a beef fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I'm at u/StratorDE in the hemicycle in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Wozu the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can see one thing: It is not extistent.
We have entered a winter paralysis and have extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Wo is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we are doing in general.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here are still really up for the MBundestag.
#Was we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found themselves who would like to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not bad, we end up with the Discord.
If you have the time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide about the future.
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself once lived vegetarian for a while, currently eats very rarely meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and vegetarians reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise, without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, so we were also weapon carriers in the executive, I do not want to go any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in particular uniform and weapon carrier people to the right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course hardly deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course you have in addition to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migration background, women and homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gays,  because these are in the executive rather less or not at all but normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely on, because in case of doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even these fringe groups, even if it sounds strange at first, represent a conservative attitude in my experience, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to please them, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing co-thinkers meet who have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally involved and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with one thing for some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything breaks down, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never really the case "that someone could spontaneously come to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been occupying me for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, fresh clothes are always there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Career in social work – as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been training for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxious avoidance) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in the open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("the simplest things messed up again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he really has to think I'm under-resourced" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at this point.
Statement of a church employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hi r/LegaladviceEnglish,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So felling application submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is thinking up everything that can be thought of.
Before I get out here now .. In short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I will not mention anything more detailed here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up teaching and was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
On the times before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still pivot.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely drained.
It's holidays now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I ask myself whether I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, where I could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter like now. but most of the time is the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't be back in the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You notice, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you, as outsiders, have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had explosive pimples during my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed on me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something someone can recommend to me.
Gynecologist has unfortunately not taken me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had previously bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive psoriasis and the acne topic.
Nutrition I also have in the course of chr. I tried all sorts of things and got stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed foods, because nothing else worked really well.
It may well be that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you have construction site everywhere like me, you don't want to go looking for what else is wrong.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have big problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
It just takes me a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be really happy.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we got hold of St. Nicholas' Day and take this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at home?
As with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is most beautiful for the children?
Cleaning your boots?
Baking cookies?
Decorating the tree?
Is music being made?
Is Santa Claus, the Christ Child coming, or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are fixed traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or is going on in your family!
The title prescribes, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, it will continue partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but who cannot (are allowed??) to carry out vaccinations there, so that I carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Tyre choice for road bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour in the coming week.
No sooner said than done and I rode off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would very reluctantly get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, tore off the day I came to pick up the bike until 2 pm 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on wheels.
But when I think that I have to change tires after 80-90kms when driving, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; These are supposed to be unflattenable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 € / tire now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
These are also (apparently?) available on the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tires for a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolute! Layman's knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people via switch, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Prepare yourself for drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
