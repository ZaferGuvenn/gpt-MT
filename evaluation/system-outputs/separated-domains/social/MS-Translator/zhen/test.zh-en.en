First of all, the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say whether this movie is a bright spot, then it's not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema is counted as one, and the one that makes you indignant after watching it is also counted, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a grammatic novel, indescribable, and has many loopholes like a trench coat on Pony.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, you find that it is actually a piece of.
Let's start with some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he and his grandmother depend on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow ??
He and his dad were still very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and her brother get a business license?
Why can the island speeding party gangsters easily close a section of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the steel bar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
Why would a gangster speeding party with bad credit and suspected violations become an auxiliary policeman?
In the face of usury, why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the innkeeper and sit outside the room door to sleep overnight?
This inexplicable plot pervades the entire film, and because the plot is so outrageous that it pains me when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the movie, or the theme of the movie at all, which is an abomination stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, when you watch half of it you think it may be a feature film that wants to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in a small town, after watching it, you don't know what you watched, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why run to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is successful step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you can honestly talk about the grudge between small-town youth and waiter girls who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot must not appear in something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role that the new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand watching it.
As for the heroine, she is obviously not mentally handicapped, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting skills or the director's requirements.
Another point I can't understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen to add crash plots to his own movies?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap racket, this kind of "entry shoot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult ———, I know if you can't learn it, and I know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so that this racket is cheap, and you are not distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have improved, and when the time comes, come to me again to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not be sold at a price, the new auction 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan to enjoy the enjoyment is not fragrant?
It's friendly to newbies, but once it's past the novice stage, it's a chicken rib, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "The Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal" article is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and firefighting, backing, and apologizing are not a word.
An article that seems to be a joke and ridicule, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, and behind it represents the inability to do the current project management work.
People engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) registrations that climb every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "Twenty Years of Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, about 420,000 people passed PMP certification, and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP®®® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing work environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does taking the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not be implemented, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; The division of labor among the members is not clear, the "old fried sticks" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-department assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to move forward ...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", came with the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
If you can't say anything, you can first see what other students say about this course: This course is not only composed of Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei's R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, but also provides in-depth and professional explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the content they learn into specific work after class.
Known as the loudest exhaust of supercars in Xinshan District!
This car brought to you by our team this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's successor – the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM2 million, a year's roadtax RM10,000, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, which is probably the editor's myvi to 30km/h when people reach 100km/h, well.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes that surround the body and the 6.5 V12 engine with an unobstructed view under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google yourself, the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's so high-profile that everyone is watching everywhere you go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit cool)
1km fuel money is around RM1 (car owner does not care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud, and when you get out of the car, you will suddenly become deaf. (It's still cool, though)
The body is too large, parking in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!
It's a little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your car, welcome to contact us!
More information about cars you didn't know can be found in The Car Guide
Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that car fans know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also million-class!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed off a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the result, it makes sense that expensive is expensive!
When NFT was quickly out of the loop, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of gameplay including NFT, and is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, close to Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will pass a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the company on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first of all, we must choose the industry with large growth space, at least a market size of more than 100 billion; Secondly, we should choose industries with good future growth and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, it is necessary to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which means do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); For example, in addition to improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); In addition to improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; On top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years old, Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market and expand cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory building and remitted 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt of Deposit for Factory Sale", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agree to sign the factory sale contract within one week." ”
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
The house that was hard to fancy, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready, so he signed the contract "at the door", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not only be attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer's Reminder】 In the transaction process, the necessary duty of care should be exercised.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is the second week since you moved to Japan.
You are walking down the street and suddenly you find someone following you, you walk faster and faster in fear, and finally run.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait! (Full Japanese conversation) You stop in front of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director, I see you're beautiful and interested in participating in reality shows? ”
You are confused and afraid that this is a scam.
He stuffs you with a business card and you find out that he is really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If Miss has time, we can go to the company to talk, and the salary must be indispensable."
You came to the company with him in confusion, and he said that he saw you on the street and very much wanted you to come.
You thought that you would have nothing to lose and still make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale love reality show divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and amateurs will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.
In the later stage, they will enter the game to break through together.
With the official recording going to start next week, you don't know who your partner will be, what's going on?
I accidentally saw the next article, from a commercial perspective and shelf life point of view to talk about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to help make canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, not the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain Why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and listening are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of listening packages is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers reacted after eating out of this mentality, and said that the taste or taste of the pretending is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why is the price difference so large when they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening equipment to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly recommend listening packaging, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotion personnel of the mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the cost of product gifts, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it is a listening device, and its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulously, linked with hospital doctors, who assist in the promotion of products, from a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder into the tank under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the listening package and the bag is the same after opening the bag, just that the bag is not easy to store after opening, easy to get wet and deteriorate.
Just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
Give science popularization to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual period someday between the ages of 13 and 15, with amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will also overturn (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some for three days, some for one week; Some people shed little, some people bleed; Some people don't react, some people are so painful that the ambulance is taken away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and no pain before does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours from the beginning to the end of the day, and all that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, and eating ibuprofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat after the start of dysmenorrhea.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically menstruation will occur within two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if you add the portion prepared in advance may have 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify it here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body makes a trip to itself.
But official crime data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and they do not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, every month to build a house (the lining thickens) to prepare to welcome guests, guests do not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month and build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, 24 hours a day a month bleeding, there will be abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants?
But people can be born because his mother has menstruated, menstruation is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come to this world, and everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women as dirty and shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels disgusting menstruation, feels that the preparation behavior of the female body for giving birth to life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think so, have never experienced it, will not experience it in this life, and men who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful, how can this attitude be embarrassed to face their mother, how can they be embarrassed to want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy that aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is the way, and the metaphysical is the instrument" in the I Ching • Zhizhi Upload, which is translated from metaphysic by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended questions.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities of existence and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is the notion that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to the study of God without saying a word.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between mind and body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating different moral views and suggesting moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what forms of moral conduct people should follow), applied ethics (scholarship that applies ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the theory of preconception, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by the social community).

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have given during the more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, most of the victims' old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families.
It is your acts of righteousness that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
The pandemic is raging around the world, and most of our donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our bereaved Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is long overdue.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of IFCSS and the China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in Minnesota.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-American Self-Federation and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Relief money often did not reach the June Fourth victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund, and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the June Fourth Orphaned Elderly Special Hardship Household Relief Fund, which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came primarily from campus and social donations in June Fourth, from generous donations from individuals, and with support from the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, after 31 years, that the families finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Chinese Right was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call to stop the June Fourth donation is for the consideration of donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people, whose income is not as abundant as before retirement, and we would like to thank Mr. Ding for his "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those fellow believers who have insisted on generously donating and risking humanitarian relief for many years.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry in this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we must look at the teachers of this institution, if the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, inquire about this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how this institution is, and whether the courses explained are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or the computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one learning cost is high, the second investment time is more, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is the situation I said, self-study is very convenient, now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to station B also have a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation can also do.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning does not have to be very difficult, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people specifically answer, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal quotas, and it is recommended to go to the company after learning, so that the interview process of finding a job can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, the aforementioned because I don't understand your situation, so only a general introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I, undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional sewing, housekeeping services
Thank you to those who silently give me likes, work hard for life Life is tiring but go on
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, if you like it, follow me, and thank those who silently give me likes
Life is like this, others only look at the result, they support the process alone, in the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, that is, to continue, the road can look back but can not go back ...
Cleaning is a job, but also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of intention.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude, see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will eventually pay off!
My daily work
- Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and retain beauty.
The details you care about, Feng Gui Housekeeping helps you to do "clean" what I can, serve the family.
Keep the house clean, tree housekeeping monument, service in place, clean to home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull if it is not cleaned for a long time, and only after cleaning can it shine, and the same is true in life
To succeed by doing it with heart, to shape delicate with meticulousness, we are serious about sewing beauty.
Give me the opportunity, it will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is trustworthy, and your recognition is what I encourage the most!
All walks of life are difficult to do at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent enough, and hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining"!
The plan of the day lies in the morning, all the good starts in the morning I hope you set off with happiness, luck, health and good luck Start the day and maintain a good mood throughout the day Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and if you had it, you were happy; When you grow up, happiness is a goal, and when you achieve it, you will be happy; After maturity, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and comprehension was happiness.
Be the truest and kindest self, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is one way, go your own way; Two treasures in life: good health, good mood, beautiful and bright to live to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Many times, what binds you is not ability, but courage to face positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you rise to the challenge, the problem will be solved.
Second, although the rightists have an era of ambition in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat; A little Zhizhi will get Longwang Shu, and if he is hit, he will be attached.
But realistically speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the criterion of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that against the necessary revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, mixed political groups, and foreign countries.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country and the people, those who try to take advantage of political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right's speech and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left will not be created, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends refuting the left madness while scaring against thieves, and they were still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the left madness, they are all tendons, and there is nothing to talk about.
Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't think about getting anti-thieves and leftists to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the anti-thief scolds you Wumao, when the left madness scolds you and the right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
Drifting away from ideals, even the dragon slayer boy eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture have led to the fact that China as a whole should be left.
While the right in the country is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, the left is more concerned about fairness and security.
Now the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time China and the United States are contending, the leftist is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by US imperialism has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The US imperialist suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises in allied countries to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains around the world.
Now the "lack of cores" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies stopping production, mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old United States has recently made frequent moves and presided over the "chip summit"; For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the old technology giant Intel spent $20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as an old technology giant of the US imperialism, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, and will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly, for Intel's move to invest in the construction of fabs, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still worried about a grudge between Frontend Semiconductor and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the sixties and seventies of last century, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the US imperialism, occupying the top position in the world, and is the hegemon in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 80s of last century, the world's semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip from design, manufacturing to packaging and testing was completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model overwhelms some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by huge production line construction costs.
In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a special design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was a small minions in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously a little self-esteemed, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February Erlong raised its head, Holliyou price increase, cargo pull incident, public opinion diffusion to form a crest, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [Lone Peak], [Jagged], and [Cliff-like].
[Lone peak] is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the hot search, attracting public attention; [Jagged] that is, periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [Cliff-like] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has completed its "function", received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad, and it must be a unified batch of water troops receiving the task and starting a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead the war to create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which envelop decisions, black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements of public opinion spread and diffusion.
Communication is a science, aside from all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks through will leave traces, and we will dig up such traces together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the current price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually risen.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, weigh up and judge yourself, I am afraid to listen to one side of the word.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle close-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to stay close to the curtain, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which do not meet the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate the projection manufacturers to use diffuse reflection for the eyes as a selling point, please, the light on the curtain that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can't see, have to be more real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be like an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain curtain that is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Provisions on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three keywords must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, the minimum amount is RMB 50 million to be established, and the consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission must be obtained.
These three are actually very harsh, summed up is to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders must have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the policyholder does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not any insurance company can meet.
At this point, not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Marie No. 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business employees, so Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: this point is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional requirements of the industry, many Internet product customers can apply for their own insurance, this will have a lot of misunderstandings, in the health notice and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their own subjective awareness, feel that they are healthy or in line, so easy to have a lot of claims hidden dangers, may be denied the risk of compensation.
I myself have done insurance telesales in "Tencent Microinsurance" (like Xiao Umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I tell everyone very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, unreliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important and light, will not tell the policyholder, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to charge according to the normal, tens to 200, many customers deduct a year or two to buy what they buy is not clear.
Thought that it could cost 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (pie in the world).
Free mobile phone delivery, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such as special policy number segment to send, and if the winning SMS is sent, they will not redeem, and no one will remind them.
(This is another pit for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject consider comprehensively and carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is better than that of Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, has 3 years of business management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor insurance products for customers, insured, shop around for customers, try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, do policy sorting for customers, policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow for life with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the application of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial", and there may not even be a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but buying insurance in this way also has a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
I have always opposed any form of slander and name-calling, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can be all-inclusive, but we must eliminate such villains.
If you do not look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that must be resisted first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, then making mocking posts, to your attempts to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you intensified not only to continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to brazenly discuss some cryptic and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, and what kind of strawberries are planted in bed, whether to insert messages such as this, I... Forget it.
Later, I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news of my police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, no matter what your status is, in our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make this ridiculous, subtle, humiliating, abusive remark, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is a girl who would want to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think there will be a girl who can say that she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who do not have even basic moral qualities would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in people's hearts.
I have cut off some of the comments for everyone to comment
There should be no one who can impersonate you in your own posts
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization
Smile heartily
Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media multi-dimensional report: The latest news on Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
On January 9, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabac Strait, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Barabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is the U.S. aircraft carrier.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as the USS Ronald Reagan, which docks in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdal".
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam last Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysis said that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 80s of the 20th century.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Visit Guam Rarely China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Fiery Cross Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 Thundering submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, and nuclear-tipped bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, the market value lost $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded to "facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue mainly comes from advertising, and today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", and many apps that add to Meta's ads are monetized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to access their own information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it exists).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Chinese companies that do maritime business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its office in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from Byte.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked at it lately, but it's certainly not going to be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just declining revenues, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not only looking at revenue, but more importantly, on future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current very beautiful scenery, there is also an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high in daily activity, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, and subversion is the blink of an eye.
And the unattainable concept of the meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and the fundamental reason why he is constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
