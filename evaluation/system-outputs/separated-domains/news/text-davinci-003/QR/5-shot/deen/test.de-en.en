Due to Omikron: Johnson to push for booster vaccinations
New Omikron cases are constantly causing concern for politics and science in the UK.
By New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned, in view of rapidly increasing Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But that didn't settle after the game - it increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the result itself was the manner of the performance.
To illustrate the dilemma, here is a statistic: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were just not focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't execute what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like performing in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
Always looking sharp: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up their dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020. dpa
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new housing will be created through expropriation.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to decide how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the USA.
More than 100 deaths could be mourned in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing their slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just flew along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He said he would love to go back to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
She still has a lot to do before the festive days: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I really have to get started now".
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the statement, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over the further investigations.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend motivated him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information circulating on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia went dark: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several communities were left without power due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is back on.
The fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back up.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
As of 11:15 PM, those still affected by the power outage would have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.

"Half Victory" against Belarus comes with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt at Crossing the Border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is apparently not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made regarding a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is alleged to have illegally overtaken.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.

When it's time to switch checking accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the savings account.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements made with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to the female and male fans equally.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And crossed the baby wish off the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Here's hoping that success and fame bring happiness.

Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.

Holetschek: Countries Discussing Removal of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated People
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already next Tuesday". − afp

Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations for the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.

The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day rate at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive medical treatment in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
Lahnstein Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle for water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein at the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a continuous increase in activity: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.

Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas of a combined size of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, more areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus Became the Christmas Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom, they are sitting in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them talk to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The plan approval decision of the Lower Bavarian government clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only open to those who are vaccinated or recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there have been revenue losses at stores with non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the CEO.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation must be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet they received.
Furthermore, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the Centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it up, scored within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and won spectacularly 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead 2:0.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
Setback for Women's Handball Team Before Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged German national team coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team was scored after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game a bit better and at least came within five goals of the opposition by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster up an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.
Tough "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also not for those "who want everything to go quickly".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that "the Huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, an educational gap was closed - even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
