Students Singing the Lead Role at Zhejiang University Academic Conference - Research Results Open Up People's Minds - Xinhua News
Hand-washing with air, diagnosing diseases by sniffing, and accurately searching for sources of smog were all honoured at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, they created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor the size of half a smartphone that can be connected to a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe lightly and this instrument can detect the initial health condition of your body from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands available on the market that can detect health conditions generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-Energy Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new line of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, inventing the intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are detected too late and not cut out properly, and this has to do with the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs that enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate according to the needs of the operation and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air Handwashing: Water-Saving and Cool
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
As soon as we step onto the apparatus, our weight compresses the air out of it.
"It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
"And now we can get our hands clean!"
Colorimetric and bacterial residue tests showed that handwashing by this method was as effective as conventional handwashing.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring both a high level of cleanliness and a saving of 90% of water, with no energy consumption throughout the process, making it energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the sole gold medal.
Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship Program - Students Enter as Prospective Employees of Enterprises - Xinhua News
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, that the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees be clarified, and that a three-party agreement be signed by the apprentices, the school, and the enterprise according to the principle of mutual selection. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection of the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools are to reform the model of talent cultivation.
School-enterprise joint design of talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training cycle as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. On-the-job training is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated cultivation of school-enterprise cooperation according to the principle of piloting first and then promoting from point to surface, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, increase the rate of employment and the quality of employment.
The China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children have a "high-tech" Children's Day - Xinhua News
The China Children's Center announced on May 20th that it plans to hold a series of activities such as children's maker experience, children's visual art festival, and parent-child book carnival around the Children's Day from May 28th to June 1st, so that children can spend the Children's Day in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
It is reported that activities held by the China Children's Center during this year's "June 1st" Children's Day include the "Love Home Create Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival, the First Children's Visual Art Festival, the "Book Fragrance Carnival" activity, and the "Family Love Reading" Picture Book Series activities.
Li Zhongming, Deputy Director of the China Children's Center, introduced at the 2016 "June 1st" Children's Day media briefing on the 20th that "Love Home Create Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival is the key activity of the China Children's Center to celebrate "June 1st" this year.
Focusing on the organic combination of social innovation and family personal creativity, through children and family participation in various innovative education activities, making innovation practice become the cultural gene of the public family, and making "hands-on" become the new learning and life style of the majority of families.

South African doctors: Omecamtiv mecarbil spreads easily but mostly causes mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omecron, is milder than that caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-strong group of doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms they are currently treating in new coronavirus patients are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but none of them require hospitalisation.
Pilley said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill if they contract the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he was treating had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported outbreak of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in the last few weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "It is still early days and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delata still being the major coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omikron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the first week of December saw a 400% increase in new cases in the Hauden province, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for over 90% of cases.
Education Times Review: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we take the famous public service advertisement "No buying, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", collective prevention and public anti-kidnapping can make kidnapping activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app, "Reunion," I feel a warmth.
The new technical means are not only named "literary" and full of feelings, but also properly used in informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of kidnapping enforcement is to locate and recover the abducted child and protect their safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But before a trafficking case is broken, the safety of the victims should be the priority.
We should set aside for careful discussion the many and varied topics of great controversy, such as "Should child trafficking be punishable by death?", and prioritize urgent matters such as rescuing trafficked children.
According to experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are known to leave the scene of the crime quickly after they have succeeded.
Every minute of delay in an abduction case increases the distance between the child and the parents and makes it harder to solve the case.
In this case, taking practical steps such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be in operation.
In order to combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Additionally, prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can still be improved.
A common example is a family of three resting at a train station, with the parents falling asleep and waking up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a reasonable level of protective awareness.
Taking turns to rest or leaving children in safe and secure environments are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of law enforcement's fight against trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years; for particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
With a high starting point and a maximum penalty, trafficking in children is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the trend of "leniency".
To this day, there are still a significant number of cases of human trafficking occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot be done solely through strict enforcement by the authorities.
If a "market" for trafficking exists, traffickers will be driven by greed and constantly innovate their methods, creating a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcement, making anti-trafficking efforts inevitably bogged down in inefficiency.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong gave speeches on the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress at Mount Malan.
Drawing strength from the Party's century-long struggle
On the morning of December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Malanshan Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, combining his own insights and personal experiences, systematically and comprehensively explained the core essence and practical requirements of the plenary session from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leaders and party theories.
He pointed out that in order to learn and integrate the spirit of the National Congress and the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping in Hunan, to enhance the ideological, political and action consciousness of defending the "two establishements" and achieving the "two maintenances", and to unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the party's hundred-year history. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the party's hundred-year struggle history, to unite closely around the party's central committee, to stay with the party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and responsibility with youth dedication.
It is estimated that in 2022, the number of college graduates in the Beijing area will reach 268,000 - Xinhua News
At a video conference on the employment and entrepreneurship of 2022 college graduates in Beijing recently jointly held by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission and the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, it was learned that the number of college graduates in the Beijing area in 2022 is expected to reach 268,000, an increase of 16,000 from last year.

The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representatives Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I have said before, the democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincided with "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening remarks that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to monitor the human rights situation of minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our primary task."
Rogan also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not recognised the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a video address of the "National Statement," emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interest, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down to defeat fake news.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were deemed to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions against a Chinese company deemed to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Girl Used as Target for Sister's Fundraising: "It's Better Than Flesh Wounds" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but that such behavior was not to be encouraged. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl Street "Archery Target" Fundraising Warned
In the circulated photo, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "human target, ten yuan per arrow". On another board in front of her are written her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens thought this was a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers."
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and attractive clothing.
The girl who was the "human target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game, while the other girl was standing by and shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for an operation, asking for help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But since treatment still required more than 300,000 in expenses, they resorted to this behavior as a way to raise funds in the short term.
He said that throughout the whole process, two girls were present, one as the target and one as the shooter, but neither was involved; no one was seen shooting an arrow, only people watching and taking pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After police assessment by the security department, the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The spokesperson stated, "We do not advocate taking this approach to fundraising."
After being warned by the police station officers, she has left the police station.
Before the "Double Twelve" of Sino-US Express, consumers were encouraged to consume rationally - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live streaming of goods once again made consumers shout out their benefits. On the one hand, this consumer boom made people marvel at the increasing national consumption power, on the other hand, it also had to make people calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve" festival, CreditEase Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "CreditEase") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
Elderly and young people have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to set up a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls, to promote consumers, especially young people's rational consumption awareness.
Over the years, CITIC has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, one must plan ahead and act within one's means to repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as car purchase and house purchase.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Credit China will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified financial products with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.
Vietnam People's Network - GCC Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the Saudi-led embargo on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely impacted the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative effect on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the US and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in the country from both countries.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of differences to restore relations with Qatar was driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is inadequate to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its aim was to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures for its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Resonating the University Spirit with the Times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated over time in the development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been of paramount importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and global educational, technological, and talent competitions are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side," is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines," which demonstrated China's confidence and determination to move from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, it also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a shorter time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to goal confidence, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic personnel, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to realise that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its own individual strengths and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
School characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowment of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our school-running: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise cooperation, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment and Diligence" and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit of "Including rivers and seas, Opening up truth and virtue, Opening up the world and the people, and Building our country" constitute the core.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hainan Rivers and Rivers" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mentality of "using the world's talents for me"; "Qi Zhenhou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth, but also to receive moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, scientific research innovation, and also shows reform and development, and innovation; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in the same glory and disgrace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise hear without listening, the enlightened see without looking."
Chinese universities should further take root in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission shouldered by higher education in the current era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit stimulate each other, so as to realize the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and provide inexhaustible power for the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua News
On May 23, Xinhua News Agency Washington reported that more than 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to protest the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu-Kong said that in the past decade, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria for US top universities had doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top US universities had remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have a "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yu-Kong explained that research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that, relative to the number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate of all ethnicities in these three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans after determining the facts.
They also hoped that the complained-of universities would take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian applicants.
The three universities that have been complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the appeal was joined by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational organizations.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of false democracy, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long been a 'mass-destructive weapon' of US interference in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US over its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There were also voices of criticism internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organising the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Schulz, also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the gap between the rich and the poor becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and bulwark against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasised that democracy is not a given, "we must renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces persistent and worrying challenges".
The US side promised to launch a year-long initiative following the summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The US hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical Democracy Summit in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Educational Thinking: How College Exams Make Both "Geeks" and "Dummies" Happy - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and requesting that the difficulty of the exams be increased, the types of questions be changed, and that the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all walks of life with varying abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation very diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass by cramming before the exam, but if they try other methods they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there was a "strange situation" where "slackers" could pass and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "scholars" who never missed classes, had good homework and notes, and only got slightly higher scores on tests.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in their reflections on the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, kudos to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, anyone who has been to university knows that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try to get exam questions from teachers, bargain for the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets and ask teachers for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, measuring the pass or fail of an exam in a university is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
As one enters the undergraduate stage of university, specialisations begin to be broken down, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
Undoubtedly, mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic subject theory and common sense, and in terms of knowledge points, there is not much variation, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university study 20 years ago is still being studied, and is still the focus."
But the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
At many universities, examination questions are usually composed by a question-setting team, and then coordinated by senior subject teachers to form the test paper. The marking of the examination is also carried out by all the teachers who teach the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level are also needed, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of the types of questions.
Exams are the driving force of university education; whatever type of exams there are, students will have corresponding study plans, and in the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The RLU School highly values the student's suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan across the school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations for self-examination, formulate examination paper topics and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper topics and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Mechanically solving the problem of single question types and repeated questions is an issue that university examiners need to face, and of course corresponding systems need to be established. However, the effort lies in daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. Not only must they master the teaching content, but they must also understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both "academic elites" and "academic underachievers" to get what they need.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(KOTA KINABALU, 11th Dec) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of stock of special anti-fraud paper, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since early October, with a cumulative total of 3200 affected.
However, the agency's director, Keralamunus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and would receive their certificates when the anti-counterfeit paper arrived next week.
At the press conference, he explained in response to a report by a web media that Sabah newspaper had been printed on recycled paper for a period of 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it could not be borrowed from other states.
Keralamunus revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and bring them back to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be ready for delivery to the applicants in two working days (20 December)."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities with 48-hour nucleic acid negative and "buffer" set-up - Xinhua News.
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities recently, requiring people who have recently left port cities on the mainland border (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to port cities on the mainland border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, the notice proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
By implementing differentiated management policies in different regions, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, it is expected to achieve the goal of early containment and reduce the risk of epidemic spread, with the least social impact and the lowest social cost, to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic monitoring and warning not being timely, high-risk personnel not implementing closed-loop management, regular nucleic acid testing being merely formal, cold chain items not being disinfected in all links, centralized isolation sites not being managed properly, and epidemic emergency disposal not being scientific and accurate.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasised that port cities should synchronise their research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicise and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and proactively respond to the outstanding issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water and air ports are open, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a YouTube documentary titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years of bloodshed and slaughter of the innocent.
The abuse of drone strikes on civilian locations such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and the formation of death squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Pile upon pile of crimes against humanity stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" has become "the more we fight, the more terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't Scare People at the Starting Line - Xinhua News
When visiting book fairs, one often senses the popularity of success-related books.
Many of the successful self-help books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, skipping over the actually most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
As such, these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely right" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, rigid and resistant to change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word "transformation," unwilling to take the first step; or they make a sudden decision to "transform" and take the first step bravely, but often the good times don't last long and they give up soon, making it difficult to see any lasting change.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "From Tomorrow On" is a classic representation of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" approach is that it often goes beyond the capabilities of the average person, leaving most people "looking on with admiration".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to find relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it became possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes an increased chance of success.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In sum, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, but it ultimately only motivates a few; the "second-best principle" is what effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.
Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 7,100 Tons This Year - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources has increased by 7,100 tons this year to 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu," is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the Qinghai Lake watershed's "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive human hunting, the degradation of the spawning water environment of the naked carp, and other factors, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of China's Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the stock of Qinghai Lake naked carp has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, and the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea expo on the spot, there are many highlights.
New-style red tea, with its infusion of tea culture connotations, is popular and in high demand, ushering in a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.
Chinese curators join hands to hold the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News
The Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is co-curated by the Saudi Art Council and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with UCCA Director Fei Tienyu serving as Artistic Director.

The biennial covers nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones Across the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Peripheral Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Of these, works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, encompassing a variety of forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; works by 12 Chinese artists were also highly acclaimed, with some artists creating works in a novel way using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's The Endless Landscape Series Behind the Story (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Barakat, CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, expressed the hope that this Biennial would establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's burgeoning cultural industries and creative communities, and to strengthen interactions.
Fei Yu said: "The biennial's aim is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to enable Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period, with artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industries discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Sky About | Gemini Meteor Shower 14th to Welcome Maximum - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not to be "nurtured" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularisation expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of activity, and is one of the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantids and the Perseids.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, colourful, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Geminids meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th this year, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Chart.
"Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression with its 'falling petals', but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be hampered by moonlight, so the spectacle won't be as impressive.
On the 14th, the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight after the moon sets, but be sure to dress warmly.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but rather to choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a clear view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets to observe visually."
It should be noted that the Twin Meteor Shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to keep looking at the radiant point of the Twin Meteor Shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter release cables are also essential for stability and continuity considerations.
Xu Li-peng reminded.
