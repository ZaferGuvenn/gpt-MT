Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
More and more new Omyron cases are worrying politics and science in Great Britain.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on corona booster vaccinations than previously targeted in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One stands in view of the Omyron variant facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get a booster now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Okron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. Dpa

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
However, this did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result, the manner of the appearance disappointed.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "We just weren't focused enough after the win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the corona virus.
Other of his appearances planned for the Advent season also have to be cancelled for the time being, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe loved to sing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly combed back and observant of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. Dpa
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have passed through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had rushed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans for vaccination calls - based on the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometres
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-outing of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy head Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking cookies and making handicrafts with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents, I finally have to get started".
Residential house fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has arisen, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused to do so because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He did not ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted – and the BioNTech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely eliminated late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire, which broke out on Friday at 7:15 p.m., severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored again.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 clock.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage would also have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire equipment houses if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary childcare places have been set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.

"Half victory" against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in the long term, said the researcher from the Berlin-based Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a member state sets its mind on doing its thing," as Poland currently does, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: an agreement in principle on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been thrown in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza by the migrants with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take domestic political costs into account.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus regularly smuggling thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day

Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman wins his first world title in the Red Bull in his seventh year in Formula 1.
His way to the top of the premier class:

When it's time to change the current account
Anyone who would have thought that now there would be peace at the current accounts is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the call money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But their lives are like ups and downs.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she is simply unlucky with luck - and is still looking for love.
And has removed the desire to have a baby from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame will also make you happy.

Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated that, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.

There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".

Holetschek: Countries discuss the elimination of mandatory testing for triple-vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple-vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when for three times vaccinated the test obligation can be waived," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) had promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday." − afp

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a break of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.

In Saxony, which had recently always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
Lahnsteiner weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the stakes are expected to increase permanently: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women in one night in order to spare them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave gave rise to the custom popular in Germany of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants were offended by this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they are protesting against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it annoys only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the St. Martin's custom with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful muddle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought it to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled, according to the authorities in a vehicle, which could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
In the name of the people: lay people make judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothes.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they do not wear robes: lay judges determine with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
110 kV underground cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed in most shops.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about slumps in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of shops with articles of non-daily use, slumps in sales were to be lamented, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
Things are only going well in food retailing and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping is not getting us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the wristband received on that day.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the revenues at about 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center, for example, and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". Dpa
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row winless Hesse were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration over a mixed start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and expressed a "blanket praise, to every single one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like another damper for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, who was particularly pleased with the result for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top shape.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on the program.
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run in the quarterfinals against host Spain.
"We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round Group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly".
Not at height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed with the kick-off.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-kick.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also saw red.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The already only faint hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer bring itself to an increase in performance and left the floor as a clear loser.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" (We in Bavaria) has caused intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also no one "for whom everything has to go fast".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
Car skidding against tree: driver fatally injured
