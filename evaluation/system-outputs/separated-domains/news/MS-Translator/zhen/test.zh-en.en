At the annual academic meeting of Zhejiang University, students sing the leading role, and the research results are brain-opening-Xinhuanet
Use air to wash hands, breathe to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students started from a curious idea, created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Diming Zhang, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone end, half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale lightly, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of the body from the composition of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling a breath, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, which targets chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: high-energy eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lights.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases is not in place, which is related to the lamps used in the doctor's operating room. ”
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early detection of cancer, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light plates that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of surgery and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water efficient and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air handwashing devices".
Just by standing on the device's handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and binds with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! ”
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System Admission is the prospective employee of the enterprise-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment and entry, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprise employment be standardized, and the dual identity of secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified, and that in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by the four parties of the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests of the apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship systems and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees of enterprises with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
The school and enterprise jointly design the talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top internship is generally 6 months.
According to the characteristics of different majors, 1 master can bring 2~5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot projects of the municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship system in three batches, each with a pilot number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.
The China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children "high-tech" live "June 1st" - Xinhuanet
Beijing, 20 May (Xinhua) -- This reporter learned from the China Children's Center on 20 May that around the "June 1" Children's Day from 28 May to June 1, the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as children's maker experience, children's visual art festival, and parent-child book carnival, so that children can spend "June 1" in the charm of cutting-edge science and technology.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly transmissible, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a physician organization of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none yet need to be hospitalized.
"They were able to manage the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said. ”
This includes older patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he treated COVID patients "had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized within days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID patients have died, compared with 20% of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports that said: "At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease . ”
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we entered this wave for only two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter.
Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases, according to health officials.
Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan "no sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", mass prevention and mass management, and the whole people countering trafficking, making trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the platform for the emergency release of missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I suddenly felt warm.
The new technological means are not only called "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also properly used by informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against trafficking is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, before a trafficking case is solved, priority attention should be paid to the victim's personal safety.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help", controversial topics such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed cautiously; However, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the place of crime as soon as possible after success.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with such an effective method as the "reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and recover the child.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and the parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should be at least reasonably protective conscious.
Taking turns for both parents to rest, or placing the child under secure protection, is the least a measure of preventing a child from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys the abducted child should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point and a maximum penalty, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the general trend of "light sentences".
However, there are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, traffickers are motivated by profit, and they continue to innovate trafficking methods, forming a situation of "fighting the law" with law enforcers, the anti-trafficking operation is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help eradicate the crime of abducting and buying children.

The democracy summit ended, and Biden said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how hard the work ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the common good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority. ”
Law also called on the free world to unite against the CCP threat.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [to the CCP] to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change . ”
Tang Feng, political councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, issued a "National Statement" via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values", emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the pandemic through transparency and mutual trust.
"At a time when democracy in Taiwan is in its ascendant, we have always been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
Global democracy has shown signs of regression during the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the shelves to defeat disinformation. ”
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights abuses, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist human rights abuses.

Girl as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think that it is a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" flooded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, with the words "human target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board, signaling passers-by to use a bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
This behavior caused heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an aggressive move to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating, and after being admonished, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls street "arrow target" fundraisers were admonished
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a "one", with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens have expressed sympathy for this.
"We found out when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers at that time. ”
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui Police Station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who made the "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl was on the side to help shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, and she raised funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so he made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was used as a target and the other was responsible for shooting, but he did not participate in it, and no one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police determined that the bows and arrows used were not subject to control.
The person in charge said that "this kind of eyeball fundraising method is not advocated".
After being warned by the police station, she left the police station.
Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" Carnival national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
On the one hand, people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but they show great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Status of China's Young People" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the young generation overall presents a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the label of "excessive squandering" on the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have occurred, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially young people.
Over the past years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has cooperated with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double 12, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan ahead and repay on time according to your means.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect the economic life such as buying a car and a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and become a reliable consumer financial partner for life.
The Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 GCC summit, when Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of differences by the Gulf Arab states in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the demand that they must unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the mobility of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion to work together.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by Gulf Arab states for finding it impossible to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to act to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first for GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the results of its diplomacy that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development for a long time, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's universities, it arose in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "enlightening the world, repairing the peace and governing the peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent competition is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's top popular in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; The second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance image; The third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal drive, pooling consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and school-enterprise integration, and forms a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligent Study, Moral Cultivation, Discernment, and Sincerity" and "Haina River, Qizhen and Virtue, Enlightening the People and Cultivating Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concept of education of world-famous schools; "Enlightenment and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that while pursuing the truth, universities should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of personality; "Pioneering the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the search for innovation in knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself in reform and development, and revolutionizes the old and the new; "Tree My Country" emphasizes patriotic dedication and says that universities should always share the same glory and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of schooling.
"The wise hear the silent, the wise see the formless".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit stir with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian American groups complain about admissions discrimination at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools-Xinhuanet
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on 23 May to protest discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth, in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of elite American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three elite American schools has remained basically at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants in their so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
U.S. Department of Education data also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian students admitted to all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained colleges to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to complain about Harvard admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the petition also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups.
Chinese After the "democracy summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "leaders' democracy summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and act anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatism and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' resulting in disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting, which was conducted virtually and was attended by leaders of 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but not by China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices in the world and in the United States, such as criticizing the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspecting that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
China's Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is fully pathological, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party antagonism, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the gap between the rich and the poor."
In his speech, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my opinion it is the defining challenge of our time." "
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "need fighters to defend it in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges."
The United States pledged a year-long campaign following the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let's all live up to our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
Educational Thinking: How to Let "Top Students" and "Student Scum" Get Their Own Places in College Examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the question type so that the exam truly reflects the students' actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, plus different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not need to work may be able to pass by concentrated assault before the exam, and if they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, there are "scumbags" who can pass the test without investment, and even get high scores; "Xueba" usually never misses class, homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, it is not for nothing that Lanzhou Jiaotong University students report problems in university examinations, and I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to give a thumbs up to these three students who wrote straight to the letter.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam unexpectedly, think of various ways to "set" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and seek "key guidance" before the exam, and even the situation of carrying a small copy in the exam and asking the teacher to raise his noble hand after the exam is not unusual.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, the measurement of whether a university exam passes or not, lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in the university exam.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and from the point of view of knowledge, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago, and I am still learning it, which is still the focus." ”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally formed into a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the composition of the examination paper, and the examination paper is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, and the questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the exam propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question type.
Examinations are the baton of university education, and what kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the students' suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of end-of-course examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is a topic that university examination affairs need to face, of course, it is necessary to introduce a corresponding system, but the effort is expensive in daily life, requiring teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, both ends thoroughly, teaching and learning will be better docked, forming a benign interaction, the exam will also be more realistic, so that the "top students" and "scumbags" have their own place.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth paper Due to special security paper, it is out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special security paper has run out, it has not been able to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director, Kerouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers are already recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained an online media report that the printing problem of Sabah's newspaper paper had been going on for 10 months.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special security paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China. ”
He explained that Sabah newspaper paper uses different security paper than other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of security paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in 2 working days (December 20). ”
"We will inform applicants to go to the local branch to collect the birth paper. ”
He added that Sabah has distributed 24,801 newsagents so far this year.

Beijing, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that personnel who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel going to land border port cities must take at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region and municipality determines the scope of the port city and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of differentiated management policies by district, from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward the threshold, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing in form, inadequate sanitize of all links of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The circular requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxing, scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight external defense line against importation.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to prominent problems reported by the masses.
According to the circular, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) where the open land, waterways and air ports are located, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.
YouTube video bottoms up the truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the US military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan war in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Excessive use of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature and setting up killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, U.S. forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black jails" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
Crime after crime against humanity has provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terror" war is "more and more fearful."
The war has not brought the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to suddenly crossing the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do the best at all or do nothing; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Tarzan, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" is "incomparably correct" for anyone who looks at it, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For people who conform to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you want to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back, and find it difficult to make up their minds; Or with a momentary impulse, they make a determination to "transform" and bravely take the first step, but often the good times do not last long, and they cannot hold out for a while before they are defeated, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most expressive expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "sub-best principle" is a path that has the potential to put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "suboptimal principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "small victory for a big victory" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
Since the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as everything persists, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "sub-best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle", despite its ostensible banner of making everyone successful, is actually a minority; The "sub-optimal principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xining, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- This reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake this year increased by 7,100 tons over the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake nudibranch, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a decisive role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment of naked carp breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake nudibranchs were listed as endangered in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main rivers and rivers in Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carps in Qinghai Lake have been artificially multiplied and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of nudibranchs resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices prohibiting fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

The starry sky has about 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great - Xinhuanet on the 14th
Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night after that day.
Beijing astronomer Anjiu photographs the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have their parent bodies as periodic comets, but the Geminids are home to asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminids are also the second known meteor shower that was not "conceived" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that meteoroids are slower, colorful, and have many bolides, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Tianjin's Jixian on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach a maximum at about 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum of 150 ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'colorful falling' Geminid meteor shower made a big impression, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be a little reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the 11th lunar month, the moon phase is a convex moon, bright moonlight will interfere with observation, fortunately in the second half of the night the moon will set, at this time the radiant of the Geminids meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to cold and warmth. ”
How can you observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light damage, and a wide view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon sets and observe visually."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and there is no need to keep staring at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and durability, a tripod, battery backup and shutter cable are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
