Because of omicron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
Politics and science in Great Britain are getting more and more new omicron cases.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London - In view of the rapidly increasing number of omicrons, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on the corona booster vaccinations than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the omicron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccination dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series good for "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, looking back on the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
But that didn't subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, the way the performance was performed disappointed.
A statistic should be mentioned as a substitute, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't do what we trained for."
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points after being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
Always as if peeled from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be canceled for the time being, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their dates that were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and liked it even as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and with an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
Incidentally, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Tornadoes kill at least 100 in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have passed through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
Several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA on Saturday night and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a path of devastation about 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado went through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are increasing every hour.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash premiums for the vaccination.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket system "New Shepard".
The flight, which lasted around ten minutes, took off and landed in the western state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, clad in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He worked hard on his assignments and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space flight: the first, in July, saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, included 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy boss Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but hasn't got any presents yet.
"The nice thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get started."
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume that the fire was intentionally set.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the LinkedIn social network
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly unvaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has refused because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling severe Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, so sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany when vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to the Biontech boss, he has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
The lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless work," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those most recently affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood help.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of the elderly or single people in their neighborhood and notify the local fire department if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need medical devices that depend on electricity or who are dependent on medical care.
Nordic Combined: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher from the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in very little, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently, it can't assert itself when a member state gets it in its head to do its thing," as is currently the case in Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have tried again to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border.
The Polish officials were thrown stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU threw its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen broke two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two breaches of the rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was filed against the score at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman overtook cars in front of him.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, which gave its name to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it was shown again how well the partnership fits.
To see beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations when selling fir trees.
On one occasion, a man is said to have gone home without his partner because the two could not agree.

The 56-year-old has already experienced many strange situations.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a bit fun, he says.
When it's time to change checking accounts
Anyone who would have thought that the current accounts would be calm for the time being is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division - to EUR 50,000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 for daily money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of EUR 50,000, which still applies, just like with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to EUR 50,000 and now to EUR 25,000.
After all: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which even got right against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like an ascent and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the sequel to her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
It's actually a miracle that she won the hearts of female and male fans alike.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and is still looking for great love.
And removed the wish to have a baby from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.

Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated that, I would have to win nine and a half times a season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who had two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, going from third to first place.
Then he changed something about the material setting and pulled out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who drives for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after fourth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.

In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden-based Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed at the not-quite-flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."

Holetschek: Countries are advising on the elimination of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
At their next meeting, the state health ministers want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the obligation to test can be dropped for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the conference of health ministers, of the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday." − afp

Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian information, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement continued after an interruption of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
The value is the only federal state above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state with a corona incidence above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia fell slightly, but was also above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated for intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind in recording new cases.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented Lord Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment truck from the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing use is expected in the long term: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.

Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new promontories with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly badly affected, about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and the children in particular will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling excitement, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How Santa Claus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days to giving presents.
Before that, gifts of one kind or another were presented to each other on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women's windows in one night in order to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving presents gave rise to the custom, which is popular in Germany, of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected mediators between God and men as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they are keeping themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only very few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like the Martin custom with Martinssingen and Martin parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving presents shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy Kuddelmuddel about the question of who is now bringing the children the presents.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the three kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's store with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
In the name of the people: Lay people help make judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear a robe: lay judges work with professional judges to determine whether and for how long someone will go behind bars.
Two of them report in an interview with the "public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John-F.-Kennedy-Strasse.
110 kV ground cable will be newly built in 2022
The permit for laying the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, which is around seven kilometers long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
The trade fears for the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Most shops are only allowed to those who have been vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized the drop in sales when dealing with items that are not needed every day.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the rest of the year negatively.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G when shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, every customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the ribbon they received that day.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Recently, without 2G, frequencies were a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will surely fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who had not won twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned up the heat, shot the frustration of a mixed start to the season from the soul within a good hour and triumphed furiously with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and expressed a "blank praise to everyone who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like another damper for Frankfurt, which is now in ninth place and still falls short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is unbelievably great," said the 27-year-old and was particularly happy for the spectators with a look at the result.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players are also highly professional.
Now they want to "go further step by step and remain modest" and "perform the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
Damper for women's handball before quarterfinals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women sneaked off the floor with their heads hanging and their eyes blank.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for our opponents," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to put out," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," conceded backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par with the kick-off.
Missing throws and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse things from happening with a few saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
The German women could hardly stage themselves against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game had gone early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and at least five goals by the break.
The only slight hope of catching up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the good-humoured opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer summon up an increase in performance and left the floor as the clear loser.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer" please?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberg, caused a lot of thought on the BR television program "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed by callers in the "Host mi?" series.
No, it wasn't "a person who is nervous."
And no one "for whom everything has to go quickly."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate people.
"The Huidlerer," the spectators learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern."
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for a number of people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
Car throws against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unknown reason against a central island and then got into the oncoming lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
