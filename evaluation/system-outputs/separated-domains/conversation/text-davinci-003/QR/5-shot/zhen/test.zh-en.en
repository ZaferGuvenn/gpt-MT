Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent this from happening again.
How much longer will the restaurant be before it's ready? Can you help me ask?
Please arrange for a replacement to be sent to me as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, not points, and I will never use #PRS_ORG# again!
Bones and spicy kimchi are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
No, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I'm not waiting, cancel the order.
I bought it from #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Cancel order
Alright, thanks.
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Thirteen dollars for one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried.
Why isn't #NAME# written clearly?
Thirteen dollars?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# sent me a meal with only one shrimp dumpling?!
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
What does it mean if we just give you an order deduction?
Is that okay?
Received, but all 3 of my drinks spilled.
My app says it has been delivered, but I haven't received it yet.
I just ordered takeout and I don't know if it's been hung up at the door.
Then it was called resend.
Why is my order being delivered to Hoi Fai Garden if I live in Sheung Shui?
Did you get the address wrong?
Bulgogi Rice Bowl to Kimchi Bulgogi Rice Bowl
Do I have to buy enough for $100 or $200 to use it?
It is worrying how long it will take to finish.
OK, sorry to trouble you.
Is it the same rider delivering to me?
Could you help follow up on this?
The restaurant stated that the food had been cooked for over half an hour.
But no rider came to the store to pick up the food.
This food has gone cold, and the food may spoil.
Order #NUMBER#, originally estimated to arrive at 18:40, has been changed once and is now estimated to arrive at 19:15!
Hurry up with dinner, time is limited!
I didn't receive it.
How could it be completed in just 5 minutes after placing the order?
Where can I find the details of the actual discount code?
Actually, it's not clear if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No thank you.
Yes, there has been a change of rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time kept getting delayed.
Originally it was to be #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I'm out of here.
No more eating.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
A diner waited for one and a half hours.
#PRS_ORG# has not been sent.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the salivating chicken that the restaurant sent is raw.
The order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salted chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# arbitrarily asked me to take it, please cancel it.
My order was for delivery, there was no option for pick-up.
Because waiting another 20 minutes would have been an hour and #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want food that was made an hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous wrong order.
But my car wheel cake is gone.
Hello, how long will it take for the order to be delivered?
Everyone has gone home.
Your rider's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Please provide a reasonable explanation.
Yes, but your rider has an issue, please take care of it.
Can we check if it's still on the way? If so, it would be best to have it delivered.
OK, if there really isn't any, then refund the money for the order.
Why so long?
Starving to death.
From expected 7:30 to now
Don't take it if you can't get it.
I can go out and buy food myself, there's no need to wait here.
Is an order of shrimp dumplings only one?
Why are there six sides to a chopstick?
I won't go.
I am sending the order.
No one has contacted me in this hour, this is clearly an online scam.
You think this is my first time ordering takeout?
That's what you said after the survey! I checked the address several times before I placed the order.
Great, thank you! How many days is that?
Since it has not been delivered by 9:30, the deposit must be refunded and the order cancelled.
Good.
The package was ordered, but two items were sent incorrectly.
Order
Paying a service fee to the rider
How can I pay now?
The takeout hasn't arrived yet.
Please contact the rider.
Yes, the order is accepted.
But the restaurant called to say that due to the rider not delivering bones, the restaurant had to cut the meat and bones apart and discard the bones.
Do you understand my question?
Not an order delay.
Or you can just call me.
Are you following up?
Does he have the correct address?
Not yet seen.
The rider went to the wrong place earlier, so I didn't receive it.
However, I have received [from PRS ORG].
The app was unable to contact the rider temporarily.
My family doesn't think so.
But it has been an hour.
McChicken, no McChicken sauce.
That McChicken would be so hard to eat if it was just dry.
Is your $32 discount code only valid when you spend a certain amount?
Can the appointment be cancelled if it's less than 15 minutes?
I'm entering code, why is it changing to confirm order?
Good.
So I don't get the discount?
Hello.
The order was not delivered.
The rider has been dispatched.
I want you to be on time, not for your coupons!!
Please arrange for delivery.
My order has not arrived.
The delivery person left without handing over the goods.
Please notify the delivery person immediately that we are still waiting.
The restaurant had given the food to the rider 30 minutes ago.
Cutlery required.
Just cancelled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you help me check if it has been cancelled?
But I had already placed my order at 5:09 in the morning.
That's the order line, they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
Alright, I'm afraid he sent the address wrong.
If you are unable to change my store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?
Do I not need to give any more money then?
The colleague's order has been shipped.
I can't pull it off.
What about GPS? Is it there or not?
What conditions must be met to use the $32?
That's alright, no need for a refund.
Your rider said they couldn't find it.
Not found.
But I don't understand the English he is speaking.
Should I return the curry soup base to you?
I only received half.
There were six boxes that weren't sent.
We were working overtime and had missed lunch, so we tried to order takeout, only to have our order cancelled.
So, can the system see new orders?
So what will happen to the rider?
I don't think I can accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to arrive.
From around 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they're ready.
I'll reorder with points, thank you.
Where is the self-pickup address?
I can't see the address.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
Not receiving food
The key is that I haven't had dinner tonight.
If it can't be delivered, please let us know sooner.
Disappointment
Will a refund be arranged?
No way! The shipping fee is 20 yuan.
No way! Ask that restaurant for me.
Thanks for following up, of course some of the riders did an outstanding job.
Hi, I've been waiting for this order for a long time.
Constant delays.
Thank you.
Please help me cancel each order and place them again.
Do I need to order for him to get credit?
Did we miss this order?
What time can I send it?
Not possible.
This code includes 4 $20 discount deductions.
#NAME# said to help me reorder.
Reordered and charged me so much money.
But I placed the order at 1:30.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the stuff #PRS_ORG# sent over must be cold by now.
I didn't take it!
#NAME# said that none of you went to get it.
We called over.
I will call the police if you don't give me a refund.
I have used #PRS_ORG# multiple times, but today was the worst experience.
Unacceptable
OK, that works.
But also to remind restaurants and riders
Avoiding a recurrence
I would like to know the exact delivery time.
The time kept getting delayed.
I don't know when it will be.
Can I get a refund if I cancel my order?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
A rider has been confirmed an hour ago.
No more waiting.
Do I need to place a new order now?
No one is answering the phone.
Constant delays.
Not yet sent.
When will it be delivered?
How can we connect?
Cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed two meals but one order was completed.
I was wondering how to contact the rider.
The first rider just told me that there should be another rider coming to deliver.
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to order food for over $180.
But the order was not deducted $20.
The restaurant only gave me one bag to put it in, it was cold outside.
Is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Wondering if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't arrived.
Today is the Winter Solstice, so sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
To order an extra meal for the children.
The store hopes to check the output even in the midst of its busyness.
So if these foods aren't hot, can they be cancelled?
He was unable to deliver it as there was no parking below.
#NUMBER# yuan has been received, which is the missing food.
That's ridiculous, you're charging money for a McChicken sauce.
Have the restaurant deliver it.
I only spent so much money on takeout because I didn't want to go downstairs to buy something.
I'm across from #PRS_ORG#.
Hello.
Is the order time continually being extended?
How long will it take to be delivered?
Originally scheduled for 16:10-16:30.
I'll wait until 7:30 to see if I can get it delivered.
Where does the Holy Road lead?
What street in Hong Kong leads to Saint Street?
What is the status of the order now?
I inputted it in December.
So this month you can enjoy a $20 discount four times with your #PRS_ORG# RED Credit Card.
I haven't received my order, could you please check if the delivery is still on its way?
Hi, can you help me contact the rider to ask if they are still on the road?
I did not receive the order, checked and there were no items, and no one contacted me to say it was cancelled.
Usually there is takeout, and the management office downstairs will call and ask. They will let people in first, but the management office has never contacted me.
There is #PRS_ORG# as evidence, no one took it, #PRS_ORG# wronged me and I take it upon myself.
I reiterate that I am placing an order.
After they were done, you had no one to deliver the meal and then blamed me for it.
I demand that you cancel immediately, or I will call the police.
How do I pay?
The re-ordered meal has been delivered.
No rider accepted.
The restaurant staff is calling me now.
I said I'd be there by 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.
What is meant by
I wasn't finished yet, what are you doing?
I ordered an axe shovel.
The restaurant told me that the delivery driver cannot deliver bones.
To ask for clarification of the reason.
Bones can be packed up and sent out by the restaurant separately.
However, the system was not very convenient, all using another.
I'm at the branch in Meinan, #ADDRESS#.
I am far away from there.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I reorder.
Has it been cancelled?
No more waiting.
I placed the order two hours ago at 19:06.
Takeout never arrived.
The jockey's phone number is fake.
I have reordered.
Will the last invoice be refunded?
If not, please cancel the order and get a refund.
Thinking of ordering early so I could eat earlier, but now it's 7 o'clock and I still haven't eaten.
I don't understand what you're saying...
Is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
That was sent to
Should I call him to tell him?
I don't think this will help at all!
Received with money belly.
The order is for a phoenix claw.
Alright, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff to explain.
Your rider told me the address was too far.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then, if you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The salivary chicken should have been cooked, but the one received was raw and inedible.
No response for 3 days...I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan as your system is unable to recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver the goods.
But the rider left it at the door, and then the person left.
That's wrong too.
Your rider has picked up my takeout order at #NUMBER# but is still telling me it is pending.
The delivery rider had received my takeout at 19:25 but still refused to leave.
Did you want anything else for takeout after I buy this?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'm calling the police.
But my food could have safety and hygiene issues.
Redeeming the promo code is all that is needed.
No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have reported it and attached pictures, but there has been no response.
What cow, no cow.
It is salivary chicken, raw meat.
Cannot eat.
Are you sure the food is freshly cooked and not old?
Unacceptable.
Already ordered in the morning.
Said to be delivered around 7 o'clock.
Why remake it?
That's outrageous.
Hello.
Just placed an order, shows the rider is waiting at the restaurant, but the restaurant says the order is ready and they haven't seen the rider.
Could you please follow up on this as I am in a hurry, thank you.
It is possible to be late for no reason by up to half an hour.
Have you actually solved the problem?
The guests I have sent to #PRS_ORG# cannot be pulled through to completion.
It's done, it's done!
If it can be delivered within 20 minutes, it won't be cancelled.
I canceled ~ after waiting a long time.
You keep postponing.
But the whole box of saliva chicken is raw, can't be eaten, can I get a refund?
Since there was no pineapple, tamagoyaki, or steamed bun, #PRS_ORG# refunded #NUMBER# yuan.
But is the saliva chicken refundable?
Because born without the ability to eat.
Can I cancel if I want to?
