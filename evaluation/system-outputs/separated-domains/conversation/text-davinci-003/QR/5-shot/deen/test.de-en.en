The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Frankly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder the order for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
When did the deadline expire?
According to the Distance Selling Law, I have a right of withdrawal of 1 month.
After my voucher is no longer extended courteously due to a complaint that did not arrive to me, I will cancel my order worth approximately.
Remove #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and order elsewhere where customer service is prioritized and I don't have to type my fingers to the bone to achieve nothing!!
What am I supposed to do with this number then??
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Tried first on #PRS_ORG#.
But that's been working for about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
They are now available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted with legal counsel and have written to them again as a result.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Hi #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
Hi, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it when I place the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it shipped to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Please process the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I'm taking a screenshot.
Hello - I am interested in the Boone Dining Table, White.
Is it also available in size 230cm?
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the returns sent over so I can package up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?
We didn't do anything with the chair.
suddenly the crack was there
I was just sitting on it.
Here, the lower part, i.e. the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
This one: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Perfect that matches :) do I need to attach anything else?
Do you just need the tracking number from my email?
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will you be sent off?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hi #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
That will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return it, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me.
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Can you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
OK.
We will not be ordering anything from you anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
Feel free to forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you're telling me I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see the screenshot for what the colleague wrote.
It is clearly stated that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Looking to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
I'm checking on that.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?
I had a huge problem with you back then when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers #NUMBER#.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, fix it and not all from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a €60 voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package needs to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
Best regards
OK everyone authorized, how can I check more precisely?
Yes, both the email address.
#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, it took a while to get to a person, they were great.
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# Team,
I have already contacted you through the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called before.
You cannot ship from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer?!
I have received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The table is for 6 people.
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked about it.
Last year due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said it had expired which made me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting only on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
I received my order today but unfortunately the color is different and the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
By the way, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, then I would advise against it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
We are also already a "regular customer" with you and have bought many items already.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
This is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of
Contact from the shipping company announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any message yet.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will get an email as confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
Wishing you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.
So I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce in addition to legal obligations.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
One more question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I need to cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had posed a question.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I can manage this.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check that.
I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to return them.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself.
I think an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to get this or decide to return it?
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot change this as I cannot be present due to a funeral.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
Starting from February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed, and re-downloaded the app and NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because this whole process has taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
We are still discussing my order which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, the message appears "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book".
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
Sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, I still have a sofa without any use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Oh, okay, I understand.
Great, then thank you again for making it so easy!
I have been getting this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting, as I
Otherwise buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Please send me the number for the sideboard.
No hardware store was open anyway during the lockdown....
I had already sent everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
but is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in black in large quantities
It doesn't help much since I've been waiting for it since September.
Nothing is working now.
My account is apparently locked and the language is English.
What coupons???
I didn't get my coupon credited for my last order!
Hello, unfortunately I can't log into my customer account.
Could you please resend me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Sure, I already ordered the same chair in blue in November and got it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pick-up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
I just got the email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Please send me any transaction number.. or anything else that could help.
Payment Confirmation... etc
I would like to give a gift voucher code.
like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that possible for you?
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Yes, we have. We have deleted all books, authorized everything anew, and loaded new books.
Will I get a confirmation email for this?
I have already been assured of this by your colleagues 3 times...how reliable is your information?
When will the shipping company contact me?
I already wrote, didn't you get my text message?
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
