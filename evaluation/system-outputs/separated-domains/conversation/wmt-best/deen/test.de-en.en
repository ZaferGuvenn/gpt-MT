The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that you can track it as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
Oh my, I don't have the wifi password available.
First I have to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
When did the deadline expire?
According to the Distance Selling Act, I have a right of withdrawal of 1 month.
After my voucher is no longer extended due to a complaint that I did not receive, I will place my order worth approx.
Remove #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and order somewhere else where customer friendliness is more important and I don't have to type my fingers sore to achieve anything!!
What should I do with this number then??
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently the chair had a defect that was not apparent when it was sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Tried only on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are back in stock and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
we used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We informed ourselves legally again and therefore wrote to you again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the color
It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover page but not leaf through it.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step of the payment.
Unfortunately the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever happen again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I redeem it myself for the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp ships in March, how long does it take to ship in itself?
I've already cut my finger
That's an absolute cheek
Hello, I just saw that showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been taken out of the range altogether?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you register?
If delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item or submitted a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.
Hello - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also available in large 230cm?
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
Can you then send me the return receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.
We didn't do anything with the chair.
suddenly the crack was there
I just sat on it
Here the lower part, i.e. the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
Here's to them: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still won't be delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Perfect that agrees:) do I need to enclose anything else?
All you need is the tracking number for my email?
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still does not work
Yes, the F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't set up the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
no no flat.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
Good day!
Unfortunately the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted the ones with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't put them together and shorten them.
Can you help me there?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
yes that's really easier!
Then we do it like this!
can you send me the return slip by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with that
Return order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made new s and are using version 4.5...
it could be that you have heard of problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, I get the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupt, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I stop reading the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for where I've read.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages
ok thanks anyway!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
In order.
We won't order anything from them again.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address) they obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment has been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help but feel completely disturbed by the chest of drawers
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund has been issued and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Irrespective of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with stools that can be purchased in addition, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price on the Odelle grey leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also reliable now?
Thank you
Kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
I'll check it.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
why is this €#NUMBER# and not like originally €1699?
Back then, #NUMBER# was already in a lot of trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not everyone from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Kind regards
ok everyone says uthorized, how can I check more precisely?
yes both the email address
#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, it took a while to get through to a person, you were great
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you under the customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
yes, but it was said before.
You cannot ship from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
And with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The base is the one for 6 people.
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it says it's expired, which annoys me a lot.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is currently on sale:)
Why does shipping only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered ware.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the whole order.
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole color is different plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Otherwise twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Can't it be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well
That's a very long time, then I would refrain from it
It's good, thanks.
I expect a response as soon as possible, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet cannot be used like this at the moment.
I would like to call you back because my wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivered to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is.....
Unfortunately I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming that they had hired the
Contacted by the forwarding agent to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I haven't received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, I didn't get any further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Have a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on January 12th, 2011.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I couldn't have guessed that the past year had gone differently than expected and couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do it?
Hello, I really like the #PRS_ORG# chair, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase using my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can be the reason?
However, the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ don't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check again whether you can at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money there.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to my doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
won't I be called?
I formulated a question
What's next?
What about the books or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can do it
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made.
But to date I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
But I saw it that way with others.
Is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hooks.
That's not a satisfactory answer and the wait wasn't worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
I understand that.
Since delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, isn't it?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipment at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a cheek.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, i.e. in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I'm asking you to do it now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection appointment.
Are there instructions for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to send them back?
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be there on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, unfortunately that can't be changed either.
Can I please be assigned an alternative collection date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of the time and then the problems started.
I can not open the book.
Followed their recommendations, but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole campaign has already cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?
yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return please !
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Ah okay I see.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Receive this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account details and contact details are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting as I
otherwise buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told one would be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
which one?
No matter where I click, I will be redirected to your page immediately.
I've done that several times and it doesn't work.
It's a pity, I would have liked to have continued to order from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order again as a matter of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
No hardware store is open in lockdown anyway.....
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
Wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large sizes
since it is available in large black
It doesn't help much as I've been waiting for it since September.
Now nothing works.
My account appears to be locked and the language is English
What coupons???
I didn't get my voucher credited on the last order!
Hello, unfortunately I can't access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the email address given above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping them for that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours
gladly, had already ordered the same seat in blue in nov.den and also got it. would have because they are so beautiful now one in gray
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
and when would be the pickup?
Good morning,
my order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible."
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next process is?
Have a nice start into the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why the request for #PRS_ORG#, since it's probably a general problem
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That doesn't look nice.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back in the package and glued it back in.
How do I proceed for the return now?
Too bad I got it as a gift and it's too small: (
I'm just getting the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and had it redirected, no chance.
Can it be reshipped directly to me or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
For me, unfortunately, that would not mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
please send me any transaction number.. or anything else that could help
transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give you a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
does that work for them?
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
yes, we have deleted all books, everything has been re-authorized and new books have been loaded
Do I get a confirmation for this by email?
I have already been assured of this 3 times by your colleagues... how reliable is your information?
When will the forwarding company contact me?
I already wrote, didn't you get my sms?
Can I place an order now and only have it delivered at the beginning of June?
