From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
Of the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac's age.
The psychology and suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different side stiffness: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - by a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area.
Also, the mattress is covered by an extended warranty period.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but the mattress's service life is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover, supplied as standard.
Purchase a orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress – it is recommended to maintain an optimal position of the spine while sleeping.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

And the guests?
They feel good, and the cake is sure to come with them.
Ever since then I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook delicacies for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Vaccination Against Coronavirus is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11th by Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against influenza."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 Lure, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with its use in mind for ice fishing, and not just for cast fishing.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is a simple monotonous one, that is, a movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for walleye and large bass in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait feed is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib trolling can provoke a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait.
When fishing backcast, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or roach by casting, besides a uniform retrieve, a "step" retrieve is sometimes used, with a "tickling" of the bottom.
If you fish in anchored areas, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from Wagner PMC in Libya."
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
"They have 30 fighter jets at the airbase in Gürdabı (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - the CENTRAL African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy assets.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not registered in any military or legal registries, and its fighters are not listed in personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "Protected and restored peace in Syria", "Decision on the "Nord Stream-2"", "Frightened the whole world with tough weapons", "We took away Crimea".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - the study of the Public Opinion Foundation says.
The Dubai Government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have also become digital only.
The Government of Dubai announced a complete abandonment of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation touched all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the lira's depreciation.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive dynamic compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium business, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On Approving the Procedure for Granting Deferred Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting a deferral of payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferral of payments on loans issued until April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
The borrower's statement may have indicated a different deferment period for payments.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and enforcement activities, notification of overdue debt repayment, and collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferred payments on loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received a deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs submitted applications for deferral to MFIs, of which the deferral was granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily transmit the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" strain of coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation it encountered no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, it became very rapid.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than usual, their antibodies weren't cut back during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when the young people of 30 years old die, while the old people of 60 years old pass it off as a sneeze.
The immune response is rabid in a young man, it is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he hits sparrows like a cannon, " concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of an emerging problem.
Meanwhile in Russia, by the end of the year they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genome Engineering, noted that this category is very actively affected by COVID.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum amount of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as pupils of kindergartens," Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genome Engineering, told Moscow 24.

Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people fall victim to COVID
The authors of the study examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died of COVID and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this as well.
The biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
The department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector reported that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4th, where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
Tutankhamun's head, depicted as the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to access employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The Bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse officially does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is outside of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is a loner, yet is well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
The main success was that at the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern-day poet has been honored with such distinction as Sergei Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and had to set up a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly painted in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind whistling?
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September
Alcohol is brain-numbing.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had deteriorated, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
Increasingly frequent bouts of depression and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Aleksandrovich, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed briefly with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing neither in Moscow nor in St. Petersburg, he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase ...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After regaining a little consciousness, he incessantly began to cough, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
Even Esenin himself after his travels around Europe and the USA (at the time there was a prohibition law in the States, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except taverns and streets ...
I'm already at the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because sorrow gnawed at me.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

The social events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was tried on by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Ballon d'Or in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analytics service reported to "Gazeta.Ru", their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, in which ambassador of the brand Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin from Lamoda warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should have the right advanced company with enough money," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel". - Owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday items will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who organize this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If the rank of the employee is lower and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so tortured pulls.
And it is not associated at all with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy sources are also not in surplus - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And then who's in the flyby?
As usual - a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about Native American issues?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They have done their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they won't sit next to them, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not recognize his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life, is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires a good and good master is a slave, a boor."
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicrone".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, urging in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two doses and a booster, or they have had the disease and been vaccinated, or been vaccinated and then had the disease, then they have a 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
"Group of Seven" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement reads.
The ministers further call on Russia to "ease escalation, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities," as U.S. President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on Dec. 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the countries of the Group of Seven, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant,” Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of viral circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky declared that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

But besides hatred, gossip, and scandals there is nothing special to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she lived a life in bitterness.

The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties said in the final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the buildup of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement published on the UK government website reads.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed strengthening and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
The UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it invades Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were in a "Norman format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke out for dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"Under the rules established by the payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Furthermore, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to identity theft.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU law
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be urging Schulz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court has fined Poland for establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about shutting down the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, look more closely.

And I know these apartments very well and can perfectly see how it was redesigned.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when they write about the means to clean the sink, toilet, windowsills, taps.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something, that you have to literally wash off.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Figures wants to give writers residences
The state will transfer to the future Foundation for the Support of Russian Writers the federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writers' residences will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital, which will become the founder of the fund, told the Parliamentary Gazette.

The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be entrusted to take care of, among other things, the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Litfond.
"A significant number of real estate objects previously owned by the Literary Fund of the USSR, including objects located in the town of writers Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region and others, have become the property of the Russian Federation," the press service of the Ministry of Statistics told the Parliamentary Gazette.
The draft decree prescribes to reflect in the charter of the Foundation that it is "created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"Creating conditions for creative activity" implies creating writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," explained to our publication in the Ministry of Culture.

Doctors have warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before coronavirus vaccination.
Therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinning medications are not for everyone, only if the patient has been hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications identified.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs that prevent excessive formation of blood clots) according to indications.
She reported that there is a current epidemic of people taking anticoagulants for long periods of time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific supervisor of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev in an interview with URA.RU said that Russians now often use anticoagulants randomly before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the internet and beginning to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that wealth and prosperity await devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was renovating one of the church's restrooms and found thousands of bags of money and checks under insulation.
He donated the find to the church and, according to him, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.'
We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It appears that the discovery is linked to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount as the award's validity period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.

In Brazil, it has been mandated to require a COVID-19 passport from those entering the country's territory, a decision made by Judge Luis Roberto Barroso of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are those who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists unvaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and applying a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
After vaccination, we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies) inside.
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
The chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help with the fact that in this case, the body's protection, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture that is seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who has been gone for a long time now) like this - if you're willing to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But the sparrow was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
On video, a method that works 90% of the time.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I had to stop many owners from running after their dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand were running away (in Pomsk), I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against COVID mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's policies in healthcare, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a false pandemic" and "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of several regions of the country was taken against the backdrop of an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, Doctor of Medicine", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans only bring death and plunder to any country they appear in.

WHO has already detected the "omicron" in sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus "omicrone" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was told in the message of the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of transmission of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicrone" in the coming months will displace the "delta".
The number of those infected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people in the Kingdom currently suffering from the "micronom", and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is further complicated by recent studies showing that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why do we need to see stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE more detailed performance of your exercises.

Curious Bunny, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, it is easy and relaxed to communicate, but when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
And to see the person live, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't catch - hence the attitude.
When he meets his man, then the views will change.
Again, the Soviet era is referred to as "the time of the beasts".
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up almost according to God's laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Talkers like Globa have little faith (and there is none at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s ...
Our St. Petersburg, or more precisely Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relations of the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, rooms were not rented, and no one canceled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angel, throw it away!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, fussy, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's a pity that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches are common, and not a boomerang!
And for what?
Did Brother push too hard without calculating the strength?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

$135 billion went into apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps worldwide grew by 25%, while downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most time on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly, user spending in apps grew by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to physical' slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the report's authors said.
India has become the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
Following it are two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are included in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most in applications for live broadcasts and online streaming," the authors of the report note.
The leader here is YouTube, the top 5 in terms of user spending also includes the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese subscription service for manga Piccoma.
The top spots for monthly active users are Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office rounding out the top 5.

Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi ordering service DiDi, YouTube client Pure Tuber, retailer app "Dixy" and online store "Samokat".
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be called one of the main takeaways.
"The industries that helped people stay connected virtually and personally have seen the most success," commented Lexi Sydow, head of marketing insights at App Annie, on the report's results.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have no or almost no plot and minimal video presentation.
The top 3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company's analysts called the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of financial applications among Generation Z, such as the Robinhood application for investors, as well as a further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, product director of Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious hacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Varonis’s leading system engineer, Alexander Vetkol, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It's a province but THERE WAS such a product in the store.

Five actions are listed that will help to prevent diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
Not only an improper diet but also habits can contribute to the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine", said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, this is especially common among hard-working people who experience headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over a week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change dramatically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a slight breakdown begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation".
An additional role is played by a late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then a reaction will occur, which is called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level of) effectiveness of the vaccine of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, because of which ... the vaccine's ability to protect against infection is being questioned, according to the text of the study, published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type II diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may present several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates which belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonised economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked Twitter of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It has been reported that India has allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister stated that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia residents voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, in total, more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists have stated, they do not recognize the results of the last election and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, President of France Emmanuel Macron is set to address the results of the referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has been a major focus of the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeatedly repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be a choice of France".
Sveta, oh, hello!
I have embarrassed you a little... a lot, still awkward, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.
On the topic: I'm not an artist, I love to draw, but it turns out to be an inspired mess.
But as an artist - not an artist at all: what can be changed here?
Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity wasn't as common as it is now.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the US.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite in a front against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted one reader as saying.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land."
"The US and its NATO allies will never go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," noted another.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant they will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11th by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," he is quoted by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions have escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranqulizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Experts have warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure upwards or downwards.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, found in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years of age eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people could die because of the omicron strain
Forecasts from British scientists show that up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months due to the spread of the mutant strain of coronavirus if restrictive measures are not tightened over the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the peak of the illness, hospitals will be receiving more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain proves to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines fail to rule out infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been identified over the past day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.

Demand for superyachts increased in the world by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the global ship registry was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars and more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a rush in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas before all these people would go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and hold negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling to space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement this.
Meanwhile, not only the number of super-yachts ordered impresses, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads have become commonplace, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the McGregor fighter's yacht, a platform for martial arts. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of an average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trace was attributed to his 162.5 meter long yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't elicit other people's sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no mooring space for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her exhortation to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol consumption per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize how four-legged pets are actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence develops.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, have no understanding of politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade between the US and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue talks in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate but just send away the one offering it.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are done secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and deploy counteraction forces," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the UNITED STATES, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe, came off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will follow the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Promotion Committee (ICSRMT).
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaojiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and the logic of thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the council of doctors established under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
"Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and variability of character," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychonervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after prison officers subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports took place in Spain.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports are also required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
Restrictions for unvaccinated people are also planned to be introduced in Russia.
The government submitted a bill on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a history of the disease, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, allowing the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday at Chinese resorts, so that all beginners become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizing Adviser, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downes said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, eateries serving national cuisine are opening.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said the WHO
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
On the occasion of International Universal Health Coverage Day on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and more than four billion people have virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister Cut Off From Broadcast at 'Summit for Democracy' at White House Request
Taiwan's digital technology minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was switched to a non-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked on it green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red, as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
They give you information like they are cooking food, and there is stale meat everywhere, actually the butcher keeps the last piece of meat.
The classic of journalism is to create news out of nothing.
They boil not meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance such as glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip with almost no smell and is hard like plastic, used as a natural gelatin.
Generally, there are more harmful substances from recycling waste than from its decomposition.
But it saves companies huge amounts of money.
Therefore, a fairy tale about ecology was invented for fools who would also work on garbage collection for free for the idea.
My personal contribution to the environment is to refrain from buying unnecessary items and to use things for a long time.
If I go beyond the limits, I do not throw it away, but give it to charity.

Don't lump them all together - bad people exist, you may have specific grievances against them...
but what does the number of children, age, pension fund and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are "scoundrels, did not return the money."
It's none of your business how many and when they have children, until they come to hang them around your neck.
And since that's out of the question, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education like that...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this also applies to other spheres of life, judicial proceedings, etc.?
For them, the laws are not written.
What if Dad does implement his own method of upbringing and education?
It's creepy and the example for others is very bad.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to cities where land checkpoints are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in force from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that a long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with both the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is being made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist Warns of Dangers of Covid Nasal Drug Vaccination Outside Hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
Setting up points for administering the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would only do this initially in medical facilities.
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is there, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

It is said that true believers make up the church.
Whether these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would like to be such a true believer, and everyone tries to be one.
But no one should say to themselves or to those who believe as they do, that they are the only true believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then so can others.

Alexander M., Could you please remind me of the style of the marathon at the 2021 World Cup?
Do you see the ski track which the race participants must finish in the classic style?
Attention, the question is - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get to the track if he was walking behind on the turn in front of the alignment?

First, as king, he took the axial!
A column lined up behind me.
Missed.
Then the belt on the GUR broke.
Then we were stopped by the police.
There was a convoy organized, and their car broke down.
Need to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with flashing lights and forward!
In my opinion, it does not come out of the advertisement whether he should grieve.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omikron-strain of the coronavirus have been recorded in a day - RT in Russian.
During the day in the UK, 1239 cases of infection with a new omicron strain of coronavirus were identified.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicrone" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April, due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the omicron strain, 75 thousand people could die.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the official representative of the Kremlin said on the TV channel "Russia 1".
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world."
It has been previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Furthermore, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12th.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to abstain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that "omicrone" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
There is also data suggesting a decrease in vaccine efficacy against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary estimates from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "Delta", - says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
Meanwhile, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They "had previously been immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The Head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky.
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will make compromises on the Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, December 12th, in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <... > internal protests and opposition of the authorities with key FIGs (financial and industrial groups). - Ed.) ", - the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin to "reformat the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
This can be brought about by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11th, data from a survey conducted by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
Among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, the residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions were soaring, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy with the rest of the victories, just as they were rooting for Salnikov, for the players, for all the then Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there they were rolling watermelons onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I'm buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent cloth.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the shoulder strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the breast.
Vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from curling up on larger sizes.

Arrested for the rally at Red Square, the poet said: "For quoting Yevtushenko they give 10 days, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was detained at Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetforrussiaismorethanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up on Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public rally.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his poem.
How were you treated by the police officers during this and previous arrests?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff were more courteous, the detention was maximally polite, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
The OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
They asked about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the four-way ventilated monkey suit, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action under this hashtag people start writing their own poems, at least a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Max, according to the protocol, talk in private even in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more, incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and yet still relies on a translator.
And even at official events, a transcript is kept in the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

Keeps them confident that the U.S. is better than anywhere else.
That's how they're grown.

Researchers have revealed how potatoes can help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of potassium, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or stewed rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are products with carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current product deficit can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, right holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, director general of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Calamari" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is what is called a bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.
Svetlana M., I'm sorry of course, but I couldn't care less if the little boy is offended for his mother or not.
If we have some kind of misunderstanding, it is better not to get involved at all, the estimate is on its way.
The good thing, of course, is that this rarely happens.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan "The outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't really change the point.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream was to have wings grow out of her back, and her dad constantly discourages her.

Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara Wall Lamp.
A wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, remains relevant and allows for advantageous accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
Due to the thin, almost invisible cables, which are adjustable in height, it seems that the chandelier is floating in the air.
Metal gold reinforcement and matte-white miniature lampshades will easily complement any palette, and the pendant chandelier and sconces presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, hallway.
Well, to each their own, as they say.
I really liked Tarragon, not the current one, of course.

Three servings of syrup - too much, in my opinion.
Two were just right.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces that are different in softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product is made up of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage".
This means that the bed has 2000 spirals that work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micro-Package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is laid with latex, then the other is laid with coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic status, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the right support for the back, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Cover: The model comes with a stretchy Aloe Vera fabric cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period – 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has the CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions launched in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as throughout the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
On the third hand, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have the traditional olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but nobody is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
Ahead are indeed ten days off, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, money she needed in training.
And after performing 5 quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
She also understands that she won't make it to the next Olympics in 4 years, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who hasn't just played a sport or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, DON'T GET IN JUDGMENT.
The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the tide.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in prices for goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Furthermore, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the global research department "Otkritie Investments" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is slow but steady.
There is also this problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
Various eco-taxis that collect waste from homes.
Yes, a banal point of reception of recyclables - it is used by marginals.
Rarely does anyone bring glass and metal there.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To put it into perspective - roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in last September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
In the 10 months of this year he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
At Kia's sister brand Hyundai, the increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in terms of increasing the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz were stronger than the dynamics of the rise in price.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to statistics from the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing a good growth in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is leading to a greater financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amidst the supply issues of auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly rewrite the price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will increase further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of car deficit, I think that many car manufacturers even managed to partially shift the costs of previous periods onto the consumer, which they could not include in the car price before.
says VTB Capital's analyst for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that financially, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices which have been observed throughout 2021, with prices for new cars rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in supply, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, manufacturers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
An increase in the volume of production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, an expert notes.
Biden spoke about the redeployment of US military to Ukraine in case of a Russian invasion.
The US government has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There were never such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some strange slop and wash another cup at the interview, it's scary to think what will be like at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an intermediary, where you can talk directly to the manager.

If a scammer is calling from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement structure, then it is not effective to hang up immediately, and it is unlikely to have time to add it to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the power structures he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
Here's some nonsense...
I just can't believe it was like that.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
They reached the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except for the very few...
Wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our cares are for our people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections ...

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?

And I can even smile at you from afar.
But I remember that thought is material!

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, off topic.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the azerbaijani-Russian joint venture KamAZ.
