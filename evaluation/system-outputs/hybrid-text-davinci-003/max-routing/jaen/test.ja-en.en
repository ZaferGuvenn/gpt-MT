When I tried to buy the entry package, two packages came out, one blue and one orange.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What's the difference?
I didn't understand it when I looked it up, so please let me know.
It should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.

Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who would be stronger if two people of the same height and weight fought?
Jiu-Jitsu
Traditional karate only practices sparring with other karate practitioners.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in particular, involves practicing with the added element of dealing with strikes.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation for Durandal's betrayal of Talia?

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the comedians are overworked? Television is all about comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a few scenes where the staff laughs behind me when I'm saying something that isn't particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a selling comedian.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood and make it awkward to work with them.
The industry is like the old black companies, with a sports club atmosphere, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a nasty attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who keep emphasizing the difficulty of their work in a way that seems to be belittling other comedians by saying "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that income is quite low until you become popular, but it's like being told every time that being an entertainer is a difficult job and at the top of the peak.
It sounds like justification for self-promotion and comedians taking up too much space in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel like it's becoming more and more impossible to touch the comedian world.
Sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart ...

Samples are given to purchasers.
The product I ordered at the TSUKUMO Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse and received a wired version of the mouse and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It's more of an online shopping trouble than a custom PC topic, but I can't make sense of it and it's a well-known place, so I'll post it here.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen in the Tsutaya Net Shop's Tsutaya Day Sale, which started last Friday (Linked to Yodobashi).
Since the wired version was the same price in the store, I checked the page for the wired version to make sure there was no pricing mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Tako), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received an order email successfully, and I also received a shipping email the next day.
In these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written on it.
Since there was no notification of mistake or cancellation between order and shipment, I thought at this point that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive.
Here's the problem: I got an email a few hours after shipping saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
They were selling the wireless version at a discounted price, but it was actually the wired version.
* Since we have already shipped a wired mouse,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only the mouse and refund
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response
It seems that the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, but the delivery note, purchase history, and email all stated wireless versions, yet they sent wired versions without permission.
Isn't it unfair to expect a refund without any understanding when you send something different from what you bought and ask us to return it?
Even if I finally accept a refund, I want to fight back with one shot, so please lend me your wisdom.

Twice isolated... Typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their food stockpiles <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara district in Yatsukawa-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 east-Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "At first, I was like, 'Seriously.'
I wondered if it would break so easily, or if it would be washed away." The Takachihara Bridge, the only road leading to the highland area, was washed away by a typhoon Japan east, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents forced to go without water used the JR railway bridge, which was usually off-limits, to transport the necessary supplies every day.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "Normally, cars would come to the garden, but when I got out of the car there, I would walk over the iron bridge with my hand or on my back, so I felt the appreciation of transportation and cars." The emergency bridge, which was completed one month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
"I thought it would be best to secure at least two to three days' worth of food," so they stocked up on canned and cup noodle foods that could be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "I felt that it would be better for everyone to have some supplies, because you never know when a disaster might strike you personally, not someone else." Meanwhile, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" when the bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Chief of the Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have designated it as 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and have announced that October 12 will be a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards.
I think there is a greater awareness of the possibility of unexpected things happening than ever before."

From what I can remember, in Hiro Yuki's video, the bad person said something like if you go to the organization that provides food, clothing, and shelter, they will somehow help you even if they tell you not to come (I'm not sure). So I guess there must be such an organization.
Experience Paramarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympics.
This event was held to let visitors experience the new joy of sports and the charm of tourism in Tokyo through digital.
Running machines and road bikes were provided at the venue, and people visiting the venue were running a virtual marathon course recreated in the virtual space with dedicated equipment.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing for an experience of running a marathon course with participants from both inside and outside the country, while also being able to enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said... "The scenery was really different and really enjoyable."
"It's hard when you're running through the streets of Tokyo like this, but it's really fun to be able to run while having fun, and I'm glad that I was able to compete with everyone until the end." The person in charge of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said, "We want people to be able to enjoy it at sports gyms in the future," and they would like to install it at the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the used housing market is doing well with used housing transactions.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
With the coronavirus pandemic leading to an increase in people wanting to stay at home, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", while relatively cheaper newly built properties have seen a sharp decrease, likely due to the same influence.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act to introduce a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, to promote safe and secure transactions of used homes (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system where a qualified architect familiar with residential properties checks the current condition of the property, including any deterioration, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Commerce explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the transaction, giving the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits.
However, under the current system, the seller mainly has the initiative to investigate the building condition.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system is now mandatory.
In other words, while real estate agents have the obligation to explain whether they can or cannot "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property", the actual implementation of such is not mandatory.
● Risks of concern due to seller-led inspections On the other hand, turning to overseas, similar systems have already been established in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where second-hand markets are booming.
In the pre-sale stage of buying and selling a house, the buyer asks experts called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" to conduct a building survey.
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of all used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in performing inspections, the nature of the Japan-type inspection of the main "seller" is very different.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building as well as possible and sell as high as possible and quickly.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the survey and make appropriate repairs to live with peace of mind.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are highlighted as potential risks concerning Japanese regulations.
● The scope of government-mandated seller-led inspections is minimal.
There is a risk of overlooking really important issues due to lack of detailed investigation ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces them to the project in question can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "speculative" inspections may be carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

I had thought of taking a month off and parting ways with the crappy company for the second time in a year, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't work, so it dragged on for a while.
It is important to go to a psychiatrist and get the proper treatment, as well as to have a record of the visits (very important).
As long as you have a history of hospital visits, even if you leave the office for your own convenience, you can change it to retirement for company convenience at the discretion of the doctor in Hallowa, so the hurdle to receiving unemployment insurance, etc. will be lowered sharply.
Even if you can't find work, or if you just want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

The term "Ginza" originally referred to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year) the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
It was formerly known as "Shinryogawacho", but when it moved to Rikagakucho it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
Interestingly, the area around Ginza used to be a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a bay extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now known as Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city blocks and built a trench to develop boat transportation.
And they dug a moat, cut down the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet to create a harbor.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of the "birthplace of Ginza" indicating the former site of the Ginza government office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?
The "Pilgrimage to the Sacred Site" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
In Ginza, a "pilgrimage to the sacred place" known to those in the know called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" is held every year.
Among the more than 10 sacred sites, the most visible is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theater.
There are often people who visit the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater before and after the performance.
Meanwhile, the "Ryukou Fudouzon" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Dejichizouzon" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are difficult to notice, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and the "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most of the shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
The "Inari Shrine" where a fox greets you at the entrance was built with great enthusiasm in places where there were many farmers, in the hope of bringing the benefit of a good harvest of the five grains.
This in turn led to the belief that it was beneficial for business prosperity in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most bustling shopping district, faith spread.

Body of Man Found in Shonai River in Moriyama District of Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City, dead.
Police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, just before 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidanmi, Moriyama Ward, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but was pronounced dead on the spot.
Police are rushing to confirm the identity and are investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, an elderly man in his 70s was found lying in the river at Sakawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are hurrying to verify the identity and investigate the circumstances at the time.
In mid-February, the benefit is paid for households exempt from inhabitant tax, but if one person in the house is tax-exempt, will it be paid?

South Korea's Posco International Acquires Australia's Senex Energy, Expands Overseas Gas Field Business - Korean Report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International Co., Ltd. announced on May 12 that it has signed a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, there are still procedures such as approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary, and the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International and Hancock Energy decided to invest 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make this acquisition because it believes that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the market in half along with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operational personnel in Australia.

Could that knee pain be osteoarthritis?!
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's Note: I have been having persistent knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does it mean that the joints become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Does rheumatoid arthritis affect joints other than the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
It can also occur in joints other than the knee, such as the fingers of the hand, the base of the thumb, the neck, the waist, the big toe, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, which is called "knee osteoarthritis".
Editor: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by two bones fitting together in a concave and convex manner.
The area where the two bones meet is covered by articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editor: It's a complex structure.
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements."
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone has rheumatoid arthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.
In other words, it acts like a cushion.
However, if it wears out or distorts, it can deform and inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash I sleep in something like a tracksuit!

Yes, there are two types.

He said he was thinking of stopping, but then decided to just go ahead and stop.

Experience the Gambling & Games 3 Selections (Real Sound) from the "Kaiji" Series - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the extreme game where lives are at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tingle... ... Take on the steel beam crossing!
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's games that can actually be played or are practiced in the planning video.
Swamp - The pachinko machine featured in the gambling-themed anime series "Kaiji" is full of traps and is called "Swamp".
In the original story, the high rate of 4000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps of "Nail Forest", "Movable Objects", and "Three-Stage Clune", and it was almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every trick in the book, eventually resorting to the outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and is played by many people.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held as a pastime by the wealthy, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in a "human horse race" called the Iron Girder Crossing.
Debtors compete in speed by devising ways not to fall on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people participate, with the top two able to win a prize, but there are only four beams and inadequate safety measures, making the risk of death quite high.
This steel frame crossing is dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience it very close at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, the home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge extending to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond it are the "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge", which can be reached on foot.
Of course, security measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kōran released a video on his YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming it was an experience that could only be had in Japan, which became a topic of conversation.
E-Card is a two-player card game.
A total of 10 cards, one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and one slave's card, are used to play separately on the emperor's side and the slave side.
The game is very well made, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against citizens, citizens are strong against slaves, and slaves are strong against emperors.
In the movie, Kaiji plays a game of poker against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
Kaiji, who eventually realized that an ear-destroying device attached to his ear, like an earbud, was reading his psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and he confused Tonegawa by shaving his own ears to the limit and making his body an abnormal value, and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from places such as Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Ryuya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which caused a stir.
■Is it possible to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why don't you feel that world view through the game?
A step towards the New Year, a gentle boost Yamagata Shimbun | Tora's grand ema at the prefectural Gokoku Shrine
At the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared.
Students from Tohoku University of Art and Technology, who designed it, visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to paint the votive tablets since the year before last.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was adopted from among the nine students of the Japan painting course of the Department of Fine Arts supervised by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large-scale painting is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Mr. Tsuchiya painted it with "the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The sight of the tiger standing still and admiring the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, one can still have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on the ema that is distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

"Let's Think About Tamano We Want to Keep Living In" - City's Four High School Students Hold Workshop to Propose Ideas: San-Yom Digital | San-Digi
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano that I want to continue living in."
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Future Center, an interim support organization, the real voices of young people will be compiled and proposed to the mayors and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, students answer questions such as "when you have fun with a lot of people" and "when you are beating the drums."
The first event was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Fureai Kaikan.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns with a sense of purpose" while moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the World Cafe method.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them by sticking them on a mock-up paper.
"A town with many young people looks interesting" "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for livability" .
We will discuss further to see if there are any commonalities.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
An 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, he realized not only the issues but also the charm of the area.
At the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the proposals.
We plan to announce it with the mayor and education director in February next year.
Rie Higashi, president of the center, said, "We hope that it will foster a love for the hometown among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to take the initiative in community development."

How to find a new way to wind a stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Scarves are essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
We often hear people say that they don't quite know how to balance the scarf after they have wrapped it around themselves, while looking in the mirror.
I was wishing for a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of stoles have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
At first glance, "Can it be wrapped up so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that the elongated cut cloth is woven into a single piece, and the whole is a mesh.
The mesh of the net has been designed so that the edges of the mesh can be passed through.
So you can wind it up and secure it without having to join the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, gilets (vests) without sleeves are popular even in outerwear, but many people wear them in combination with stoles so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I think it would be convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like a raw, life-size Beatles, with a lot of freshness...
We're on the brink of breaking up so there's tension, but it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
Paul, who is troublesome like "I know I'm annoyed, but come on!" while doing his best, George, who is struggling to say "But...", and John, who calmly says opinions and jokes, but is late and unmotivated... Ringo, who plays the role of Nagose, didn't actively say anything, and he sat behind me with a face saying, "I'm in trouble."
We don't hate each other to the point of fighting like that, but there is a certain atmosphere that says, "Well, we can't work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that. It's kind of like the dismantling of legends.
And when the performance starts in such an atmosphere, everyone is really full of talent.
It's crazy how a simple phrase can turn into an amazing song just by going back and forth with "What do you think of this?"
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing.
The scene where a subtle hum gradually turns into a catchy "Zu-cha♪ Zu-cha♪" and lyrics come in was recorded perfectly.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composition like this.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is sweating profusely, so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
It seems to be only one out of three episodes, but so far I had the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
Even though the four of them would start having fun making music, when it came to the conversation of where to do the live show, the producer and the promoters would start talking in a "The Beatles are the best in the world!" kind of way, and it was easy to see that the four of them had lost control of the situation.
Well, documentaries also have the director's interpretation, so maybe that's what Peter Jackson felt...
Also, it seems that Paul supervises it, so I thought that might be why Paul has many scenes where he looks like a bad guy.

Tornadoes frequently occur in the United States, causing major damage Unseasonably warm and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of Friday the 10th to Saturday the 11th (local time), tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth of the period caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, resulting in the rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest into the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday the 9th and Friday the 10th has risen to nearly 30°C local time.
In this record warmth, a strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward around 5500 m in the sky, and an active front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is historically prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter months, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusty winds on Friday the 10th (local time).
This shows that there are two main concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, which is the third strongest of the six levels, and it is believed that a gust of wind of around 70 m/s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged to be EF4~5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita scale but adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which is equivalent to this tornado in the United States, is quite likely to occur in Japan, and it is at the level of a wooden house collapsing.

US tornado 'largest ever' calls for help in live broadcast from under the rubble (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
On the subject of tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) as "one of the largest tornadoes in US history" with a solemn expression.
CNN TV and others reported.
Biden emphasized that "as a federal government, we will do everything."
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
There is a fear that the death toll could exceed 100.
Pictured: Residents carrying household items from damaged homes in tornado-stricken Kentucky From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
There are records of 219 miles (about 350 km) of tornado damage that damaged Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN weather experts in the United States estimated that this time it was the largest at about 250 miles (about 400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was severely damaged, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
At the time, 110 people were employed there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remains.
In the dark, a woman who was stuck under a 1.5-meter-thick piece of rubble felt the weight of rescuers searching the rubble and called for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which was apparently sung by another woman while crying to dispel her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in her basement with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, like something was erupting," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police Department officer said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, a warehouse belonging to internet retail giant Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least six confirmed deaths.
Trains have derailed from the shock of being uncoupled and highways have been blocked due to the effects of vehicle overturns.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to make more?
Consume high-protein foods and beverages.
Avoid coarsely cut raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying something can be done.
It would be great if there were "live-in work" options like hotel or resort jobs that could provide both an address and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social climate of the coronavirus pandemic.
I did a quick search and found this website↓,

There has been an old saying that different people have different opinions about star rating systems.
It is argued that while other countries deduct points from a base of five stars, Japan takes a neutral stance of three stars and adds or deducts points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a two-star difference, and four stars mean something completely different, from "has flaws" to "not a masterpiece but still good".
If you use 5 stars as a standard, "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest standard in everything" will be equal, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, I would like you not to give it 3 stars (bad reputation).
So trying to argue against people who make these kinds of claims with a binary rating system on Steam won't get you very far.

Is there a USB-powered submersible pump that can accommodate a standard hose size?
The capacity of the power supply that can be taken from USB is 5V up to about 2A, so it is only 10W at most.
Depending on the water pump, it will consume at least 500W, so it is impossible.

Winding of a homemade radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitors and coils, but there was too much noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was a different radio than the one I was tuning into.
It's possible that the tuning was too sweet and didn't sound solid, but it was different from the expected station.
I'm supposed to have made an AM radio, but it looks like I heard FM radio.
Why do you think that? Is that even possible?
Can I delete SMIM or Esp from Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?

I understand the risks and have no plans to actually do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" "Freshly-caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento "Fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a take-out specialty restaurant of colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables.
Last August, Takayuki and Yumi (both 39) opened their restaurant with the goal of providing customers with a restaurant-like experience at home.
One of the popular bento menus is "Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available in the market at the time.
"The fried shrimp is made as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients," says Takayuki, and the plump texture of fried shrimp can be directly understood.
The bento box comes with vegetables to accompany and about four kinds of deli, rice with millet grains, and soup made from Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are purchased home-grown in the soba field or at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that provides a "familiar and comforting taste" (Yumi-san) that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, like rolled omelette.
The popular bento box "Hand-kneaded Domestic Beef Hamburg Steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release the Charcuterie Set, a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to be at Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I decided to try it out.
Ride quality It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not so much that you get drunk)
Speed, naturally slow
I felt safe because it slowed down or even completely stopped when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze around me hurts, it's good to be seen, but it's painful to be seen as if it's in the way.
Overall, it was not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
However, since it is laid-back, I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little fewer people because you can relax while looking at the scenery.
It was a thrilling ride with a futuristic feeling of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings, which is quite difficult for those who are not very patient.
I was so embarrassed.

Man Cut with Knife, Escapes on Motorcycle in Saga City - Attempted Murder Incident on 12th - Saga Shimbun News - Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Department, a passerby called 110 saying that they were "fighting."
The man sustained a wound of approximately 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth on his left cheek, but is conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several acquaintances, and he suspected that there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the man on the motorcycle.

A family's long journey to establish environmental protection efforts in China's frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Find Asia Corporate Consultant in Hong Kong) China, with its vast landmass, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection but also the activities of environmental activists.
Shisapanna in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such region.
Li Wenda, my sister, is currently an actress. Sipsongpanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Dai (Thai) people" who share Thai roots with the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River flows through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people in China covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet with Li Min-guo at the Seesaw Pan National Park, and hear about the environmental protection activities he is carrying out.
■ I started environmental protection activities with my German husband ― ― It has been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the impetus for that?
Ms. Lee: Our environmental protection activity "Tianyan" started its activities in 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China scientific project.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and was renowned for its rich biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of the rainforest has progressed in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was previously in short supply in China.
The husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and study biological resources.
He met and married me, who was a reporter here.
Did Li not have any interest in conservation before then?
Lee: I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Why do you think some people have an aura even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or a tall stature?

It's not detailed, is it?
It's obvious.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I'm not sure what you mean by "praise in detail" since I've never been told that before.
I guess it was a detailed compliment.
What would you do if you were confessed to Sakura Yokomine?
"Sakura-san confessed, my heart is in full bloom, please come here," I replied.
And to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
If I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to?
Opening them simultaneously will expedite the process.

【Omakan/Personal Memorandum】 The mod caused CTD in its own environment and took about one and a half months to identify.
Until March, stable data was not available for much time to play since GW, and CTD due to multiple factors was occurring, and it took a very long time to identify it if it was only a holiday and I investigated it little by little.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dlls and meshes don't leave a crash log.
〇 Main CTD timing
All Papyrus and .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the logging type will leave no trace in the logs.
*When accumulating kills/attacks on some NPCs: Activated even with console kill → Improved with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF *Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
Camera work for activating kill moves against some NPCs → PC kill move setting OFF via .ini for basic improvement: Conflict in settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoor) Field movement + some magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all OFF, 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Is this due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for the body mesh? Also, the default .ini for SPID usage in 2.0 has a formatting mistake, but as a result, it should have applied the prerequisite Perk to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the part attack and OnHit-related motion/combat mods (.dll ones), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German, and French levels.
I thought it might be useful to post this as a reference in case there are any other people in a Japanese environment who are having similar CTD issues.
Everyone is pretty much doing it on the edge of their mental capacity.
People around you don't notice it, not to mention your colleagues, or even your family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that this person is doing a good job even though he seems to be struggling.
But he's probably on the brink of mental exhaustion too.
I haven't officially retired for mental reasons, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Nursing Visits - After Today's Nursing Visit
I have been receiving home care visits for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I have developed a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, it also does the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, today's home visit made me realize how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication.
Today, we talked about gender differences between men and women, or even gender theories lol.
We also talk about things like sexual desire between men and women, or why she got divorced, or is it okay to talk about such things in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances about cases in psychiatric hospitals where visiting nurses, who were unable to work in the ward, came and only provided administrative support, or where an occupational therapist came for a visit but was given orders in a condescending manner, saying "We are providing medical care here".
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who treat Frank on an equal basis with me with mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing, and some of you may be thinking of receiving it.
Visiting nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, please go ahead and take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to break contracts because I could not get them to agree.
I'm sorry for the pun.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There may be several possible causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the creator.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China's ... "Delay in Implementation of Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative) by 2022 and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in fulfilling its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
The National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) announced on the 12th a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (USA), Gore (U.S.A.), and 3M (U.S.) supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020).
However, the All-Japan Council of Trade Unions reported that "in effect, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually lower-ranking among competing countries."
The order of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States in 2017 to become the number one, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, South Korea registered 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to become the fourth largest, but still lagging behind China (4,721 patents) at 22%.
The Zenkeiren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D expenses.

From the Meiji era to the Showa era, were sisters and wives a minority compared to now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so commonplace that the phrase "sister-in-law" is being used.
And in the past, people were told to look for a wife who was one year older than them, even if they wore golden straw shoes, so I think there were many older wives in the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime for a store to sell items at a higher price than the list price?
Today the PS5 sold in stores for 70,000.
It is lawful.
As it is a free market, for example, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and the price to rise.
The reason why the PS5 is being sold at a high price is because of its scarcity value and its value has increased from its original price.

Parliament on Sunday?
, TV program-style leaflet creation Parliamentary reform underway in Takasu, "report book" of lawmakers: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic edition
Takasu: The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as creating unusual leaflets announcing regular meetings and introducing a "report book" in which townspeople evaluate council members.
The town council election was held without a vote for the third consecutive term, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to publicize the Sunday Assembly meeting held on the 12th, about 1,800 new leaflets were distributed in newspaper folds on the 9th.
"Asa Kara Nama Gyokuro", "Tetsuko no Heya", "Sawaguchi Hito Tansaku Series"...
The leaflet, which was distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th, has words reminiscent of the name of a popular TV show.
Representative Katayamabei, 43, who created the event, said, "I want you to smile and go to Congress."

US Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engage in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) - U.S. State Department officials reported on Tuesday that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine under a security aid program approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (approximately ¥6.8 billion), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
Pentagon spokesman Kirby said the aid included lethal weapons, including the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's military buildup around its border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has become increasingly wary of Russian military movements and is in talks with NATO members to plan what to do if Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1 this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, total aid has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, it dispatched the Florida National Guard as part of a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a Pentagon statement, U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational security.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, and there were tense exchanges regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand" is directly targeted at Masaki Amari, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of Diamond Weekly was titled "Talking with Your Family During the New Year Holidays!
It is called "Advance Gift and Pre-Inheritance Technique".
While discussions of the integration of inheritance and gift taxes have been left out of the proposed 2022 tax reform outline, it is highly likely that in the near future, lifetime gifts, a common inheritance tax mitigation measure, will become a "forbidden hand".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Kanemaru, and a Member of the House of Representatives, we will impart everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the year-end rush of advantageous gifts.
(Edited by Keiichiro Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
● Prohibiting pre-mortem gifts used by everyone from wealthy people to office workers in urban areas "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale studies to establish a tax system that is neutral to the choice of timing of asset transfer."
A sentence from the ruling party's fiscal 2021 tax reform outline announced last year caused a great deal of unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what it is saying is that it is trying to increase inheritance tax by changing the rules of inheritance and prohibiting the "king of inheritance tax measures" of lifetime gifts.
The ironclad rule for mitigating the burden of progressive inheritance taxes is to "reduce the taxable assets".
The strongest trump card, pre-mortem gifts, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers who have a home in the three major metropolitan areas and incur a small inheritance tax.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integrating inheritance and gift taxes" emerged.
Although it was postponed in the FY22 Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10, which was a concern that it would be introduced as quickly as possible, "We will review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar-year gift system" and "Since the gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit ... we will constantly review it." The policy for unification was renewed with more in-depth language.
Former Tax System Research Committee Chairman and former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Akinori Amano, said in an interview with this editorial department.
"The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of the transfer of property, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when you do it.
At the moment, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise [through integration]." If the revision is the fastest, there are three remaining chances to give gifts during life.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, there will be a major shift in the direction of invalidating pre-mortem gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will inheritance and gift tax rules change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from midnight on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
"Photo: Kanako Yamaya as the heroine. Based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's BE・LOVE from 2018, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past."
The main character, Kairi, is served by Furukawa, and the heroine, Riyo, is played by Kasumi Yamatani.
Riyo, a college student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly with the help of Riyo for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother, who was separated by her parents' divorce, but at some point, Kairi is a murderer, isn't he?
Yuudai Furukawa Comment Drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
I hope that those who could not see it on FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to learn more about this work if they know the development and see the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Riyo, as well as the state of the two people struggling and changing.
I hope that fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

How did the players feel about winning a game with only three passes? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in this game.
This was the fewest passes in the NFL in the past 50 years since the Bills' two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had an unsurpassed genius RB named O.J. Simpson who surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with Simpson and another RB Braxton run.
The main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border and has the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was 18 meters per hour, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills were local and didn't change their playing choices much.
25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it wasn't a failure.
In 10 offensive series, there were four red zone incursions and scoring opportunities.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, he only managed to score three runs in those three innings, one FG.
Defending in front of goal in the final game of the match.
Trailing by four points, the Bills committed a penalty at 3rd&9 to make it 3rd&14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
In 3rd&14, QB Allen flowed out of pocket and to right, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense.
He then threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
On this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran on a charo-a-cross and broke free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On the 4th&18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran in from the outside left into the end zone, but his pass was unsuccessful when he was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of him.
Bryant was covering Bills WR Cole Beasley one-on-one, but he saw Allen's move midway through the game and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw passes to the end zone on both occasions.
The pass on 4th down may have been a decisive shot, but on 3rd down, there was no need to aim for a TD.
You just have to take a first down in two plays.
It was still 2 minutes ago, so if I made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to run his own would have been alive.

Time to Throw Away and Replace: 3 Items You Tend to Keep in the Kitchen for a Long Time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can still grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in a microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
chopping board
The United States Department of Agriculture has suggested that cutting boards should be replaced when they become scratched or grooved.
This is because once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria multiply.
If all is still well, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry with either air or a clean paper towel, patting lightly to remove excess water.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also cause lips to be cut or drinks to spill due to missing parts.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submersible General Guan Yu Posted by: Builder 于Ban

"Got it!"
"You'll never know when you'll be killed by Cao Cao!"
Saying that, the general left and went back.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water assault, underwater bridge three-quarters practice! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and sink them in a cage.

Community markets and trading are different things
Because the community market uses Steam's payment system
This feature allows for red envelope transactions with strangers, which can lead to scams where people are left with items but no money.
That won't happen.
Trading is a feature that allows items to be exchanged or gifted as presents, but does not have a buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different topic?
In fact, I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees in simple labor, and cases of non-regular employment even for intellectual labor.
Help FlashBIOS Won't Finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced my B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed there without blinking.
Trying to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS in case it is corrupted does not seem to work at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end even in 1 hour.
The possible cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the guy who converts and uses the SD card

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have a branded product.
You can carry items that are not too conspicuous, but you cannot carry items with the Louis Vuitton monogram and the letters "LV" written on them.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits you.
By the way, I think it would be a good idea in Japan.
In Japan, it is ____.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin-esque.
I should have said it earlier, "Why are you talking to me so casually/using informal language?"
And it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner? If that happens, you should simply say that it is uncomfortable.
I don't think I would even dream of having an unpleasant feeling with a somewhat decent probability.
I used to live abroad and when I went out, the Japanese people, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people there and I think they misunderstood that they could say whatever they wanted to the locals.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's done without any malice, more like a kind of coddling or friendly attitude.
If my friends are from the West, I call them by their first names, but sometimes when I talk to them in Japanese, I am a little confused about which one to use.
Well, it's okay if it's a friend.
I guess I'm just doing it purely normally, but if I overlook it, I may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment of Gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Can you please speak according to Japanese rules since we are in Japan?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person, so that I'm not treated strangely by people younger or older than me.
Japanese people, regardless of personality, are so detail-oriented (including me) that it's annoying.

I'm so happy!
Thank you all for subscribing!
Actually, the number of subscribers was 25 as of yesterday, so I thought it would take a little longer until 50 people came, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am very grateful.
If you subscribed to this sub today, it would be great if you could let us know in the comments where you heard about it! (I'm really curious since I don't have any idea!)
Since there is currently only one person making threads, it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could make threads as well.
It would be encouraging if you could comment without having to start a thread.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
If you're using Twitter, please consider starting a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The last subreddit I made didn't get enough people to join, so I gave up quickly, but this time I feel like I can keep going thanks to all of you.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules and make the sable easy to use, so thank you for your continued support!
After all, it had nothing to do with snow.

If we continue to make such exaggerated forecasts, I think viewers will not believe them.
Has it accumulated in Tokyo?
Well, please flush it into the water!
I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text has a bit of a strange feel to it, but it conveys the message and should be fine for playing (I'm just feeling this way, so it might be good to ask others as well).
I often see this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel that if you are a small company, you are translated well.
I think that the reason why people who are not Japanese native speakers understand the difference between the fine nuances of Japanese is whether they can reach it even after studying for a long time.
I'm not sure what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people would not feel uncomfortable with, I would suggest looking for someone else.

How much would it cost to buy the same quantity and item at another store?

Well, when I told my friends that I was living by myself about three kilometers away from my parents' house, they said, "Why don't you just live at home then?"

I think there are many reasons why someone might want to live alone, wherever they are, so it's up to the individual to decide how they feel about it.
What do you want to do first when you come to Kirishima Onsen?
After soaking in the hot springs, eat sashimi while drinking beer, then drink local sake while eating local cuisine.
The consideration is that training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human hymn< > commemorating the start of the anime "Yukaku-hen" (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the recent manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique is the amount of training it involves.
It is a common belief that training arcs, where there is no battle and the characters train day and night, are not popular with readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, there was a two-year training, but they only drew touches and boldly skipped the rest.
Well, one of the attractions of Wangpi is the eccentricity of the land you move to, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
The training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and Giyu said to him, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, only to be forced down by the strong with sheer power...
While saying that, it was Yoshiyu's kindness that introduced Sakonji Kitaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Killing Squad (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Tanjiro's first encounter with Rengoku was when he was asked "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and Rengoku responded with a single punch, "You're too slow to decide."
It's an apparently absurd exchange between fans that has become a talking point.
But taking his sister, who has become a demon, with him carries the possibility that he will be forced to make such a judgment at some point.
It could be said that this is an initiation into practice from a mental attitude.
However, Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, takes him to Sagiriyama and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are thin and full of pitfalls, stone throwers, and traps, and you will die before you can start training.
Still, with his sharp sense of smell, he can barely detect the faint scent of a trap set by a human and somehow manage to avoid it, which is barely enough to be called a "heroic correction".
Still, "That doesn't mean you're suddenly so physically capable that you can avoid it all of a sudden! !" What makes Tanjiro say that is the essence of what makes demon slayer a demon slayer.
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is just being able to use the power and skills that have been honed up to that point to their full potential.
The "Law of Equivalent Exchange" that states that one will be rewarded in proportion to the effort put in and nothing will be rewarded for no effort is a humanistic anthem that differs from the supernatural power of a god and is a difficult rule to break that is consistent throughout the work.
Is this old?
It is still a way of sleeping that is not a bed, but a mat directly at the house, and you sleep on a mattress or comforter.

I think there are a lot of people like that.
Are you frustrated?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fall under what I think is "stubborn".
I think that it is "condemning" to plan to somehow get more profit than effort with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has established a new "DX Division" to integrate home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be seen that the aim is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly launched DX division is comprised of business units from its CE and IM divisions, including Visual Display (VD), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, Mobile eXperience (MX), and Networking.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
It also emphasized the company's intention to make it easier for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflected the strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation of differentiated products and services across organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics is already envisioning a strategy through the Multi-Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through linkage between devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Is 1500BCE the same as before the Common Era?
How would you say that in Japanese?
It was around the year 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for non-Christians, it has become more common in recent years to use BCE instead.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

I recognize it because I supported it on Kickstarter and worked on translating it into Japanese.
Personal preference aside, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be appropriate for a natural science documentary narrated by a low-voiced man.
I would like to see the expression heavier and more formal.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> Larva ambush in the sand to capture prey at any time, showing only the disc-shaped head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The larvae of the mantis lie in wait in the sand, ready to pounce on their prey at any moment, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be.
What I'm worried about is
Have you consulted any other documentation?
* Are you looking at it from the ant's point of view?
Is that so?
If you translate armoured heads as a disk-shaped head, I think the part that says "On the scale of an ant, it is a giant beast wearing a helmet" disappears ...
Aichi 24-Vehicle Collision: Truck Driver Has No Pre-Existing Conditions, Was It Carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no pre-existing condition and that the accident was likely caused by some form of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the prosecution on the morning of the 12th.
The Nomura suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some kind of negligence was the cause.
The police are conducting a thorough investigation by searching the premises and gathering information about the situation at the time.

Oginuma X no Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began with three volumes, concludes with this fourth volume!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted everything from the opening to the semi-finals at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses only on one match!
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● The superhuman wrestling match has already begun before the match even starts!
In short, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, the mutual tug-of-war and special training scenes are quite different from before, and it doesn't lead to a match, but it's never boring.
The tension of the story gradually increasing as the century-long war is about to begin is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly a calculated production that makes one marvel at this period.
And before the important final, one more thing you can't miss is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxury of the match card, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman said to the Kinnikuman poster, "Now it's my turn! ! 」
and try to slam the chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to be passing by, catches the sword and blocks it, stares at each other silently, and the scene separates with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
But there is a dispute over this Kinnikuman.
If I were to be shown something like this, I couldn't help but think about their activities in the distant future!
It is a scene that still makes me feel as a manga artist that when a character stands up, that is what it means!
The fight between the two does not take much time, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
"Don't underestimate the power of divine luck for Kinnikuman!"
That's what she said.
This is already a grand meta statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character after all, and that he has somehow won in areas where he is not a protagonist.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei preemptively drove home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one sentence, the reader is left wondering, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman is actually going to beat Robin with his own strength?"
How? 」
The uncertain development will stir your imagination again, and if you look at it from the artist's point of view, this is a line that is as if the teacher who created the work imposed a bind on himself.
I thought you did a great job.
I think it's definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Takahama-cho Nakayama, the first ever winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
The winter illuminations that began on November 26th have 50000 LED bulbs scattered along the pathways, lawns, and a 20-meter-high cedar tree. (December 12th)
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there was such a place.
It's so beautiful and I was relieved."
The illuminations were first planned to help people feel soothing while avoiding crowds, and are lit from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25.
On the final day, the 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with button pot serving and a movie screening planned.
I think the number of people who can read the documents in order is limited.
My friend who can read a lot told me that he was capable of doing it, but he was slowly building up his knowledge from the basics of Linux and reading from reference books rather than documents, starting from the table of contents and reading the parts that interested him.
It is better to learn from Linux rather than jumping into something abstract like Docker, as it is easier to understand and can be applied more easily.
It's quite hard to pull that out and suddenly understand everything.

Also, instead of memorizing the contents, he seems to remember only the things that he skipped before and read them when necessary.

Online distribution, agricultural and livestock product PR Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, relayed from Yonezawa| Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JAs in the Okitama area, conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce" that sells products while distributing videos on the Internet.
The Yamagata Aisen Bujotai group made a remote appearance on the "National Collaboration MINATO (Harbor) Market TV" which was first planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, delivering the charm of the region along with their special products.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project" collaboration between the Okitama region and the port district resulted in a store opening, which was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranomachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wears the Yonezawa Weaving Brand "Nitorto" and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.

When viewers were able to experience the deliciousness, comments such as "I can smell it even though it's streaming!" and "It's the best with lots of delicious things to go with alcohol!" flew around in praise.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power to the PC for the NAS has gone out.
〜What happened~
Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
The PC is powered on.
2.) When I returned to my room after a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from the PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only deteriorating due to the room temperature drop (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Without booting.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will briefly turn on and the fan will start, but will quickly stop.
After that, I don't say yes or no.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it still sticks for a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard to ATX 20 pins and 4 pins, remove the other parts and try but it does not start.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause because the PSU fan has been hitting something for a long time and there has been a buzzing sound.
I will try to find an extra ATX power supply and test it later.
Maybe.
What if it doesn't work?
Should I change the case and motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits recently (within the last 4-5 years)?

I think so.
