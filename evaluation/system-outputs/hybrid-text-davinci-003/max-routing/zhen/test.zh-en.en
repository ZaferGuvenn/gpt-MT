Is there a way to punish him?
So that something like this does not happen again
Or how long will it take for the restaurant to be ready? Can you ask me a question?
At the annual academic meeting of Zhejiang University, students sing the leading role, and the research results are brain-opening-Xinhuanet
Use air to wash hands, breathe to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, they created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Diming Zhang, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone end, half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale lightly, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of the body from the composition of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling a breath, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart wristbands available on the market that can detect health conditions generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, which targets chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-Energy Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lights.
"Many diseases are detected too late and not cut out properly, and this has to do with the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This smart surgical light has four light plates that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of surgery and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air Handwashing: Water-Saving and Cool
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
Just by standing on the device's handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! ”
Colorimetric and bacterial residue tests showed that handwashing by this method was as effective as conventional handwashing.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring both a high level of cleanliness and a saving of 90% of water, with no energy consumption throughout the process, making it energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

Okay, trouble
A certificate that I find very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
FYI: First aid is actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, four golden minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, our official figures show that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotels of Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Reaction, said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to have any chance of saving someone.
I found that very few of us now have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
First aid certificates can be obtained at your local Red Cross training centre; I got mine at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai, with a student discount.
PS: The last picture is of goals to be achieved before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
Then I have to go to test for other certificates that I want to take, and I plan to take a diving certificate, before I saw in Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate, it seems that you have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER #
Thirteen dollars for one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried.
Why isn't #NAME# written clearly?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery, this time I will eat a shrimp dumpling!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally believe that Four Seas is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say the movie isn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, from the kind that make you fall asleep in the theater to the kind that make you angry after watching. For the audience, Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei, able to ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like the windbreaker on Little Horse's back.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find it's just a pile of crap.
To start off, I'm having a hard time understanding some of the plot points.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he and his grandmother depend on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighbourhood to take her in a small van to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people taking a bus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were still very relieved about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
How were the Island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road and the drivers of the trucks around could not be found.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
Why would a delinquent and criminally-suspected biker become a police officer?
In the movie, why didn't the person facing the usury report it to the police, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key, and then forces themselves to sleep outside the room door when they can't find the hotel manager?
This nonsensical plot was pervasive throughout the film, and I find myself in pain when I recall it due to its absurdity.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, was the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which was an ugly patchwork of nothingness.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, when you watch half of it you think it may be a feature film that wants to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in a small town, after watching it, you don't know what you watched, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why run to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people, the tropes of various types of movies are also very familiar. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romance movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role that the new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand watching it.
As for the female lead clearly not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I'm also quite curious as to why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes to his own movies?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?

Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship Program - Students Enter as Prospective Employees of Enterprises - Xinhua News
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment and entry, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, that the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees be clarified, and that a three-party agreement be signed by the apprentices, the school, and the enterprise according to the principle of mutual selection. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection of the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship systems and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees of enterprises with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools are to reform the model of talent cultivation.
The school and enterprise jointly design the talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training cycle as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. On-the-job training is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot projects of the municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship system in three batches, each with a pilot number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly transmissible, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-strong group of doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms they are currently treating in new coronavirus patients are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but none of them require hospitalisation.
Pilley said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
This includes older patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he treated COVID patients "had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized within days."
Within two weeks of the first reported outbreak of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in the last few weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports that said: "At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease . ”
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter.
Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we take the famous public service advertisement "No buying, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", collective prevention and public anti-kidnapping can make kidnapping activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I suddenly felt warm.
The new technical means are not only named "literary" and full of feelings, but also properly used in informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against trafficking is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, before a trafficking case is solved, priority attention should be paid to the victim's personal safety.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help", controversial topics such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed cautiously; However, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are known to leave the scene of the crime quickly after they have succeeded.
Every minute of delay in an abduction case increases the distance between the child and the parents and makes it harder to solve the case.
In this case, taking practical steps such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Additionally, prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can still be improved.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and the parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was gone.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a reasonable level of protective awareness.
Taking turns for both parents to rest, or placing the child under secure protection, is the least a measure of preventing a child from being abducted.
From the other side of law enforcement's fight against trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years; for particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
With a high starting point and a maximum penalty, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the general trend of "light sentences".
To this day, there are still a significant number of cases of human trafficking occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If a "market" for trafficking exists, traffickers will be driven by greed and constantly innovate their methods, creating a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcement, making anti-trafficking efforts inevitably bogged down in inefficiency.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the provincial party congress in Malanshan
Drawing strength from the Party's century-long struggle
On the morning of December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Malanshan Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, combining his own insights and personal experiences, systematically and comprehensively explained the core essence and practical requirements of the plenary session from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leaders and party theories.

Actually, it's not clear if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Can't be traced
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No more, thanks
Yes, there has been a change of rider.
He has been waiting for a long time

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by removing foreign matter by mechanical cold pressing and filtration directly from fresh olive fruit.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a light and pleasant botanical aroma, acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavour, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and colour, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden yellow colour.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution method and refined after refining.
If you have read the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be noted that olives, like grapes for winemaking, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best places for olive tree growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive growth, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others with similar climates, as well as far-south countries such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Months for harvesting olives:
From March to June each year is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for harvesting the fruit (freshness is key for olive oil).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how hard the work ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I have said before, the democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the common good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority. ”
Rogan also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not recognised the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
That's why we have to change . ”
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a video address of the "National Statement," emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the pandemic through transparency and mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interest, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the shelves to defeat disinformation. ”
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights abuses, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist human rights abuses.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time kept getting delayed.
Originally it was to be #NUMBER#.
Then I won't call anyway
Don't eat anymore
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you so long.
No, I didn't receive a call
Please inform him before sending it to our company
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANY MORE #NUMBER# MINUTES
A meal waited for an hour and a half
#PRS_ORG# has not been sent.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the salivating chicken that the restaurant sent is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices often correlate with friendliness, and if you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones; these "entry-level" ones are actually industrial junk.
They are very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext behind them is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy something expensive, so let's give you a cheap one to fool you, you'll play it twice and then never play again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have progressed; then come back to me and buy the expensive stuff, and I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200. Isn't it great to enjoy a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is a letdown after the beginner stage, but most people, especially women, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salted chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# arbitrarily asked me to take it, please cancel it.
My order was for delivery, there was no option for pick-up.

Actually, there are many considerations for dressing for girls who are slightly overweight.
Girls with fat bodies should wear skirts that are not too short or too long, and the length is almost at the knee, just enough to cover the fat place of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be revealed.
Being too tall gives the impression of being short and stout.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - top, skirt and long socks - in different colours, it will create a slimming effect and make you look taller.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and a noble and elegant black skirt is the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are very full, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more mainstream the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid drawing attention to your legs and feet, give the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or fishnet tights (the kind with small holes) should be worn. Choose a soft, printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the flaws of a chubby girl.
Of course, slightly chubby girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts, you should choose a top that is the same color as the short skirt, which will make your fat body have the effect of increasing height.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the hottest look of the summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your assets.
A-line skirts are slimming and are better suited for plus-size girls; tops should be more fitted to create a layered look that is more slimming.
A simple white t-shirt paired with a skirt is something that even plus-sized women can try.
Petite girls can also dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls can be the focus of everyone's attention.
In addition to changes in clothing combinations, exercise more in life and strive to get out of the label of "slightly fat girl" earlier😄

Girl as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think that it is a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, with the words "human target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board, signaling passers-by to use a bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but that such behavior was not to be encouraged. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girls street "arrow target" fundraisers were admonished
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a "one", with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens thought this was a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We found out when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers at that time. ”
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and attractive clothing.
The girl who was the "human target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game, while the other girl was standing by and shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for an operation, asking for help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so he made this behavior.
He said that throughout the whole process, two girls were present, one as the target and one as the shooter, but neither was involved; no one was seen shooting an arrow, only people watching and taking pictures which were posted on Weibo.
Later, the police determined that the bows and arrows used were not subject to control.
The spokesperson stated, "We do not advocate taking this approach to fundraising."
After being warned by the police station officers, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Also Win Gold Medals in the Olympics" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can be absolutely first-class in many projects, and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
A seemingly jokey article also speaks to the daily struggles of project managers, representing a sense of frustration with the current state of project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging by the increasing number of applicants for the PMP (Project Management Professional certification) each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing work environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
But does passing the PMP guarantee smooth sailing for project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project dragging on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor cross-departmental assistance and communication, making it difficult for the project to move forward...
Therefore, having focused on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D personnel such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It has brought the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, resulting in efficient operational outcomes for the business.
To get an idea of what other students think of the course, here is what they say: The course is not only taught by the experts from Zhongtianhua-Xia (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many real business scenarios from well-known enterprises to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the content they learn into specific work after class.

Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live streaming of goods once again made consumers shout out their benefits. On the one hand, this consumer boom made people marvel at the increasing national consumption power, on the other hand, it also had to make people calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
Elderly and young people have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially young people.
Over the years, CITIC has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
On the occasion of Double 12, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, one must plan ahead and act within one's means to repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as car purchase and house purchase.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Credit China will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified financial products with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

The Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 GCC summit, when Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of differences to restore relations with Qatar was driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the mobility of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion to work together.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by Gulf Arab states for finding it impossible to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to act to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its aim was to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first for GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures for its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Known as the loudest exhaust of supercars in Xinshan District!
This car brought to you by our team this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Priced at nearly two million ringgit, with road tax of tens of thousands of ringgit per year and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
I don't know, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while it takes my Myvi to reach 30km/h, it takes them to reach 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google yourself, the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, so uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool).
A kilometer of petrol costs around RM1 (drivers don't really care).
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine is too loud, and when you get out of the car, you will suddenly become deaf. (It's still cool, though)
The car is too big and it will be too narrow to park in a regular parking spot, I'm afraid it will get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one else on the road. (This is something I said, not the driver, haha!)
Don't be mistaken, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Involving a car crash worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be familiar to car enthusiasts; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed off a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!
As it turns out, you were right!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated over time in the development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and global educational, technological, and talent competitions are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side," is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a shorter time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to goal confidence, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic personnel, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to realise that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its own individual strengths and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
School characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowment of each school.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and school-enterprise integration, and forms a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligent Study, Moral Cultivation, Discernment, and Sincerity" and "Haina River, Qizhen and Virtue, Enlightening the People and Cultivating Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concept of education of world-famous schools; "Enlightenment and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that while pursuing the truth, universities should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of personality; "Pioneering the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the search for innovation in knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself in reform and development, and revolutionizes the old and the new; "Tree My Country" emphasizes patriotic dedication and says that universities should always share the same glory and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise hear the silent, the wise see the formless".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit stimulate each other, so as to realize the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and provide inexhaustible power for the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly leaving the scene, the crypto community was coming up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of gameplay including NFT, and is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, with more than $3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue is over 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will pass a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing a news article about my friend's stock was the choice of track for the enterprise, i.e. the choice of investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics is about "doing the things right," or doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and most tactical thinking has space for strategic thinking.
Thinking beyond how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to deepen in the current field or expand into other fields (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking), one can consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; thinking beyond how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years old, Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market and expand cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From a blockchain technology development perspective, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua News
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on 23 May to protest discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth, in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu-Kong said that in the past decade, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria for US top universities had doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top US universities had remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have a "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hoped that the complained-of universities would take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian applicants.
At present, the three universities complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the petition also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory building and remitted 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer double; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, putting down a deposit, and preparing the payment, Mr. Lu was left frustrated and angry when the seller refused to sign the contract at the last minute.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
The court found, after hearing the case, that the parties had ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the fault could not be attributed solely to the defendant; it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, and thus the case should not be subject to the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract.
After the first judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
[Legal Notice] Necessary due diligence must be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of false democracy, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' resulting in disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long been a 'mass-destructive weapon' of US interference in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US over its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices in the world and in the United States, such as criticizing the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspecting that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Schulz, also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the gap between the rich and the poor becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my opinion it is the defining challenge of our time." "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces persistent and worrying challenges".
The United States pledged a year-long campaign following the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."

Nichang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Quickly served My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Tang". The Mala Tang is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 Those who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
Delicious food, good meat, and friendly service.
It's been a while since I've been to Rishang, and the fruit lao is still so good & the ingredients are plentiful. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time, and it was just the soft floury southern taste I love!
The porridge was cooked to just the right degree of dryness, with a generous portion. The signature tin-foil chicken wings were as good as ever, and the soup was also good. The kale was also well-prepared...
The taste was excellent, the service was friendly, and the meat was good.
The old shop of Ritchang has been a popular spot for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden flooring.
We always had to wait a long time at the entrance for the claypot rice, and the claypot was cracked...
It's been years since I last went to eat at Richeng; the rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
Rarely do you find a restaurant with seating available right away, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The meat is good, the main dishes are great, and the taste is excellent.
Nisshang takeaway.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three cups of chicken: a little too much side dish and slightly less chicken.
The main seasoning of this dish is a bit off, the salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness, you can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label whisky drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and Red Label Whisky has won a gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you're wasting its smoothness.
then How do you drink red label whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction.
How to drink red label whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is a blend of approximately 35 Scotch whiskies with aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky flavours, with sweet and smoky aromas.
The mouth is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red label whisky entered the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of Chinese people, red label whisky + cola or sparkling drinks such as Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acidity, can bring pleasure to the eyes, and when added to drinks, they can dilute the taste and change the flavor.
Red Label whisky + slices of lemon + cube sugar (or granulated sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly tart taste, sugar can be added to neutralize the acidity, and lemon will give the drink a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky; everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully this introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How to Let "Top Students" and "Student Scum" Get Their Own Places in College Examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and requesting that the difficulty of the exams be increased, the types of questions be changed, and that the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, plus different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass by cramming before the exam, but if they try other methods they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there was a "strange situation" where "slackers" could pass and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "scholars" who never missed classes, had good homework and notes, and only got slightly higher scores on tests.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in their reflections on the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, kudos to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam unexpectedly, think of various ways to "set" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and seek "key guidance" before the exam, and even the situation of carrying a small copy in the exam and asking the teacher to raise his noble hand after the exam is not unusual.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, the measurement of whether a university exam passes or not, lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
As one enters the undergraduate stage of university, specialisations begin to be broken down, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
Undoubtedly, mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic subject theory and common sense, and in terms of knowledge points, there is not much variation, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university study 20 years ago is still being studied, and is still the focus."
But the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
At many universities, examination questions are usually composed by a question-setting team, and then coordinated by senior subject teachers to form the test paper. The marking of the examination is also carried out by all the teachers who teach the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level are also needed, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of the types of questions.
Exams are the driving force of university education; whatever type of exams there are, students will have corresponding study plans, and in the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of end-of-course examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanically solving the problem of single question types and repeated questions is an issue that university examiners need to face, and of course corresponding systems need to be established. However, the effort lies in daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. Not only must they master the teaching content, but they must also understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both "academic elites" and "academic underachievers" to get what they need.

Mrs. Kim's Bridal Photography (Nam-ro Store) does not currently have any branches.
Before taking the photos, we had to change the time twice because we hadn't arranged it properly, and our consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, a weekend with good weather was chosen for shooting.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I had ever done my makeup properly - wow, I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally check our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt happy after a day of taking photos.
When selecting photos, because I had seen many cases online, I was reluctant to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, just the 24 in the package, not one more (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked and there were two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me to retouch them.
Flipping through the photos my sister took before, I really felt satisfied with our photos; they were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I really recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Xuan Hanjin!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you, and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special security paper has run out, it has not been able to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director, Kerouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers are already recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained an online media report that the printing problem of Sabah's newspaper paper had been going on for 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it could not be borrowed from other states.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of security paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and bring them back to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be ready for delivery to the applicants in two working days (20 December)."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From around 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they're ready.

Education Information: Beijing Compresses the Proportion of Exceptional Students Enrolled in Junior High School in 2016-Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of special students enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was uniformly organized and implemented by the education commissions of each district.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhuanet
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities recently, requiring people who have recently left port cities on the mainland border (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to port cities on the mainland border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region and municipality determines the scope of the port city and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, the notice proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of differentiated management policies by district, from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward the threshold, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic monitoring and warning not being timely, high-risk personnel not implementing closed-loop management, regular nucleic acid testing being merely formal, cold chain items not being disinfected in all links, centralized isolation sites not being managed properly, and epidemic emergency disposal not being scientific and accurate.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasised that port cities should synchronise their research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicise and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and proactively respond to the outstanding issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water and air ports are open, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing Truth - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a YouTube documentary titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years of bloodshed and slaughter of the innocent.
Excessive use of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature and setting up killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Crime after crime against humanity has provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terror" war is "more and more fearful."
The war has not brought the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Upon seeing the following article, why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning from a business and preservation perspective, although canning is deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So you might be wondering: why is the shelf life of a bagged product one year, while the shelf life of a canned product is two years or longer?
Or ask: why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, out of this mentality, eat and then react saying that the taste or flavor of the canned product is different!
Now I will tell everyone why the hearing aid is expensive, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they had a large increase in their pricing of hearing aids to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to promote tin packaging rather than bag packaging.
And you think so many manufacturers spend hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this money come from?
As you can imagine.
As society develops, so too do the costs of marketing, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product giveaways, and advertising costs.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening devices, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose was to gain higher profits, even though their raw material costs would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to unscrupulous means and link up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, taking a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
China's laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any effect on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food; if the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting book fairs, one often senses the popularity of success-related books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you "what" you need to do.
In other words, skipping over the actually most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
As such, these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely right" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, rigid and resistant to change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word "transformation," unwilling to take the first step; or they make a sudden decision to "transform" and take the first step bravely, but often the good times don't last long and they give up soon, making it difficult to see any lasting change.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "From Tomorrow On" is a classic representation of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" approach is that it often goes beyond the capabilities of the average person, leaving most people "looking on with admiration".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to find relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it became possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes an increased chance of success.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In sum, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, but it ultimately only motivates a few; the "second-best principle" is what effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.

The resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xining, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- This reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake this year increased by 7,100 tons over the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake nudibranch, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a decisive role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment of naked carp breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake nudibranchs were listed as endangered in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the stock of Qinghai Lake naked carp has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carps in Qinghai Lake have been artificially multiplied and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of nudibranchs resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices prohibiting fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

It's been an hour and it still hasn't arrived.
I just read an article about menstruation and it was too long.
A little bit of male education for the uninitiated.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual period someday between the ages of 13 and 15, with amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately; there's a margin of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to come earlier (sometimes several days earlier).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with 24 hours of bleeding over a few days from start to finish; the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and furniture.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but taking it after the cramps start won't be of much use.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the time of your period and you have sudden stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Cotton swabs do not need to be changed frequently; they should be changed every five to six hours, at most every eight hours.
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation can also make one's mood unstable, making it a bit of a bummer when the body trips itself up.
But official crime statistics show that women have a high ability to control their emotions and are not likely to use emotional issues as an excuse.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is at its thinnest, then gradually thickens; it can be understood as the uterus being a house, building it (the endometrium thickening) each month to prepare for a guest, if the guest doesn't come, it is all taken down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, bleeding for several days and 24 hours a month, plus abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But a person is able to be born because his mother has menstruated, which is to prepare the house for you to stay in for 10 months when you first come to this world, so everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women as dirty and shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting, finds the preparation of a female body for the creation of life disgusting, and says so in public, girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and never will, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton strips, they're really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, so sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
To order an extra meal for the children.
I hope that the store will check the products in their busy schedule
Does a foot bath tub tingle when it is electrically charged?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide range of products have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was good, and although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath now does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of setting the maximum temperature, which people it is suitable for, and what kind of material is guaranteed to be harmless.
Generally, footbaths do not have an electrical issue, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been released without proper inspection.
Therefore, choose a freestanding footbath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to measure it casually.
Thirteenth Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Council of All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum for "five-color Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, and the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua praised the "source of lake red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, infused with tea culture connotation, popularity, trading fire, Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy that aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji era.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended questions.
Ontology is the study of which terms represent real existing entities and which terms represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is the notion that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism is a research method that does not make any assumptions about the existence of God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating different moral views and suggesting moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what forms of moral conduct people should follow), applied ethics (scholarship that applies ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the theory of preconception, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by the social community).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have provided over the past 30 years since the death of our family members, especially since I first issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families of their own.
It was your kindness that helped our families in distress get through the most difficult times.
The pandemic is raging around the world, and most of our donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have been brought to a perfect conclusion long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in their 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which ran for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund," which has been running ever since.
Funding for these projects came primarily from campus and social donations in June Fourth, from generous donations from individuals, and with support from the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Square incident.
During this time, China Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donations was out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired and not as well-off as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
Thanks and respect are due to those brave and generous comrades who have risked their lives for years to deliver humanitarian aid with open hearts.

Thank you for choosing our product. Please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following before using our chip:
Please check that all items are present and correct upon opening the box.
If there is any defect, please contact customer service in time.
The cover plate on the microfluidic chip is made of PC material; do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a hand push syringe to inject the chip directly, otherwise it is prone to leakage.
Microfluidic chips on ordinary substrates pass pure water tests at 500 mbar (100um channel depth) or 300 mbar (50um channel depth) injection pressure before shipment.
Chips on glass substrates are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) inlet pressure before shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using chips on glass substrates, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution when using and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage will occur.
For microfluidic chips with a common base, we suggest a flow rate setting of below 150ul/min when using a syringe pump with pure water for sample injection, and a flow rate setting of below 50ul/min for the oil phase.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid and increase your flow rate parameters from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels of the universal chip in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for long periods of time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand higher pressure or flow rate, you can contact customer service to customize.

Thank you rabbit for your comment Originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style I didn't expect the finished product to come out and it was simply beautiful
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great - I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production was impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match a makeup look suitable for your style, using only top-brand cosmetics.
Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We were working in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had taken photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I deliberately searched for this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version for most people, and photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-designer, a fine team.
We and everyone around us were all full of praise for the finished product.
I have recommended my girlfriend to go over, and my girlfriend is just as happy after watching the negative.
Hoping that such studios won't be buried, that more people will discover them and shoot in their own style, not in a cookie-cutter way.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling, both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customers like us do our best to complete it, grateful for the acquaintance and encounter
The sweet and caring assistant, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, thank you all 😘😘
Thank you for the comments from Little Universe. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you all. I'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play again if I have the chance.
How do I give money?

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you're planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a great option, especially for those with weak self-discipline; training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if it is not strong enough, then the training institution is not of much use, of course some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm actually not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation, and learning this subject has a lot to do with the individual's own circumstances.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer professional who has graduated, then I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time; this is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays there are many offline and online training institutions which are also very good, but they have a high cost of learning and require a lot of time to invest, usually requiring 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-learning is very convenient. There are many learning resources on the Internet now, which are free, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some classic books that can be used in conjunction with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions now sign employment agreements with internal referral quotas, recommending students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
These are my thoughts; as I don't know your situation, I can only give a general introduction and not a detailed one. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it in the app

Give me a chance and I will make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is to be trusted, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough out there in all industries right now!
But I always believed that as long as I had the right attitude, was persistent and worked hard, I would be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day well begun is half done; all good things start in the morning. May you start the new day with joy, luck, health, and good fortune. Have a good day and keep a good mood all day. Good morning!
As a child, happiness was something to have; as an adult, happiness was a goal to reach; as a mature person, happiness was found to be a state of mind to be understood.
Be the truest and best version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life to the fullest!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first Saudi Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhuanet
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diliya Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the Diliya JAX Art District, located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriya Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Feiyu Tian, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The biennial covers nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones Across the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Peripheral Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Of these, works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, encompassing a variety of forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; works by 12 Chinese artists were also highly acclaimed, with some artists creating works in a novel way using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's The Endless Landscape Series Behind the Story (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Bakli, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale will establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Fei Yu said: "The biennial's aim is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to enable Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennale, there will also be a series of lectures where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhuanet
Kunming, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance for people who have been lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to a relevant official from the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income through employment, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Finance, and mainly standardized the scope of targets, fund management, post development, and post management of personnel recruited for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development settings, the new regulations clearly stipulate that post settings should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "post setting on demand, personnel based on post, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong
Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I place a new order
Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wing has had successful periods in history, they have not lasted long; they are like flowers that bloom in the sun and sweat when given a sip of water; they are easily elated when successful and quickly discouraged when faced with defeat.
But realistically speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of government and protecting human rights should not be denied.
For me, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I take his words seriously and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I opposed his anti-communist theories, as I believed that anti-necessity revolutions would inevitably lead to social unrest, harm the people's livelihood, and a mix of political groups, followed by foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people; those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
Leftists are actually a bunch of outcasts from the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyse their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with anti-rebels and refuting Leftists, and they were quite emotional. I think there's no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics; they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the anti-revolutionaries and the left-wingers to admit it - why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent piece and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them so obsessively that they become distorted.
Drifting away from ideals, even the dragon slayer boy eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom; China's innate historical and cultural genes lead to the overall tendency of leaning left in China.
The right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness and security.
Now society as a whole is looking for more fairness, and the Sino-US rivalry is definitely leaning left, likely to continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up and be done with it.
Don't say anything, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US's suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries to impose a blockade on our chip industry, has directly resulted in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and phone prices rising, with almost all industries using chips suffering the consequences.
In order to gain control of the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to form a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US technology giants, such as Intel, an old American technology giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Investing $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opening up chip contract manufacturing business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to snatch away TSMC's "rice bowl".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is sure to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Intel's decision was met with disdain by TSMC founder Morris Chang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was so dismissive of Intel's foray into the semiconductor field because he still harbored resentment from the feud between TSMC and Intel over 30 years ago.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of American manufacturing, occupying the pinnacle of the global market and dominating the world semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chips designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model put a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs had to back away from the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to see division of labour and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specialising in chip design, he thought that since there were companies specialising in design, then it would be possible to set up a factory specialising in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing," providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was a small minions in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognised that Intel had a disdain for semiconductor fabrication services at the time.
Surprisingly, the giants that once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel was entering the semiconductor foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
No more waiting.
I placed the order two hours ago at 19:06.

"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to get into the hot search list and attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in a single glance: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuned operations, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Communication is a science, aside from all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks through will leave traces, and we will dig up such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries detected the first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhuanet
Beijing, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new coronavirus variant.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time on the 10th.
According to Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other was a local resident who tested positive for the virus on 30 November after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons both turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed the first three cases of Omicron virus infection.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized because they all had mild cases.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government has continuously increased prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 and over arriving by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The health ministry conducted genome sequencing on 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and identified the three cases of infection.
Takeout never arrived.

Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, 156 Huan Cheng Nan Road
Initially it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as they arrived at the store.
When I first went to the store, I just showed them my floor plan and they didn't even measure the house. They were able to give me a quote of 70,000 for my 135 sqm house. They showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that they will drag you into the store and make you pay a deposit (which you will never get back unless you have enough experience to fight them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This was a big scam and I was a living example of being duped, paying a deposit of more than ten thousand in a moment of impulse.
His quote to me had a lot of issues - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to get my money back they were very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
In any case, it will be a bite to death, it is the customer's problem, and they are completely not responsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and a lot of details, don't want to say all are tears, in short don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees afterwards.
Damn, they were the original scamming head decorations, now they changed to Da Mei, it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decorating company.
In the future, everyone should do more research and consult more when choosing, because decorating is not a small expense.
To ask a merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Posting of any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited; please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then, if you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes

Sky About | Gemini Meteor Shower 14th to Welcome Maximum - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not to be "nurtured" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, colourful, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach a maximum at about 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum of 150 ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).
Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Chart.
"Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression with its 'falling petals', but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be hampered by moonlight, so the spectacle won't be as impressive.
On the 14th, the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight after the moon sets, but be sure to dress warmly.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but rather to choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a clear view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets to observe visually."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and there is no need to keep staring at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and durability, a tripod, battery backup and shutter cable are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television the OP mentioned should refer to LCD TVs, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or rather, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting user demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales for 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, the sales of laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The success of laser TVs in the big-screen market is mainly due to their excellent performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, top-brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, in terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing I really hate is when projector manufacturers use "good for the eyes" as a selling point for diffusion. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling lit up too?
Furthermore, the projection screen fabric would not be able to form an image if it were not diffusely reflective.
It was precisely the hot-spot (glare) effect of the high-gain screen that was overlooked, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that was really uncomfortable.

After adding her on WeChat to book a date, the lady sent me a list of available times and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the shop's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling~ The photographer would arrange some props, guide the actions, and be very meticulous about the details before taking the photos.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should look nice 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the post-production style, and feel very attentive.
It will take about half a month to fix the film, so wait and see the results~
I won the second photography-themed grand prize event~ most of the clothes in the venue could be chosen for a photo shoot.
She finally chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer was my younger brother from the post-95s generation, who felt a bit inexperienced. I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.

Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too!
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose the clothes, including wedding dresses. They were very patient when I tried on three or four sets. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, when taking photos, they taught me how to pose. The only problem was that the photos made my face look too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received them in three or four days and there was no difference from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are almost three makeup positions, and inside is the studio.
The service was very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also teach you poses very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to reshoot.
Experience: The shaping may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
Eyebrows were also shaved off, which was a bit awkward for daily life without eyebrows.
The photos were given ten days later, but the effect of the double eyelid stickers was not very satisfactory, it still felt very obvious.
Not sure what style to go for, I tried two sets, but in the end I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and the editor said he would have the finished product within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfying~
No reply for 3 days... Since my credit card is not recognized by your system, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Provisions on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three keywords must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, the minimum amount is RMB 50 million to be established, and the consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission must be obtained.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent; in summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) for insurance companies and banks, and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Rain Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Rain Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it is still good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel salaries, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It is worth considering.
In terms of professionalism of the salesperson: this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims issues and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Weibao" (like Little Umbrella, an internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsibly telling everyone.
Insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners in the internet channel, and there is a lot of sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
Thought that it could cost 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (pie in the world).
Free mobile phones were only given to policy numbers with special endings such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message was sent out, no one would remind you to redeem it if you didn't.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term, if only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if a serious illness really occurs, 60,000 can do what, can not solve the problem, the future life begins to be naked.
Misleading internet insurance sales are currently being cracked down on by the government.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully, as many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for customers. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Growing with each customer for life.
I hope my answer was helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although taking out insurance online may lack the "ceremony" of it, and may not even involve a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal force of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat akin to a "telephone sales" assembly line approach, can have a fatal flaw when it comes to buying insurance: follow-up service may not keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, so when we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider if the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
So how can I contact a food delivery specialist?

Redeeming the promo code is all that is needed.
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange a redelivery, I have purchased it separately, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help.
I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate anything, but this kind of villainy must be stopped.
If you do not look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that must be resisted first.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to the posts with sarcastic comments, to your attempts to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me in a subtle and humiliating way on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether to plant strawberries in bed or not. I... just forget it.
Later, I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After my news report was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your making of the picture or continue to post all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, and do not have the power to stop you.
I neither know nor want to know you, and my looks and figure do not need your criticism.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those without basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in people's hearts.
I have cut some of the comments for everyone to review.
No one should be able to impersonate you on posts you make yourself.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Break into a smile.
Vietnam News Agency - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two main sessions were held during the 3rd Vietnam National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development, focusing on two major themes: digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the number of digital technology enterprises and operating income in Vietnam still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical digital products were cultivated in quantity, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam, many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Hung called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to fulfill the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state agencies, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared various breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote the digital transformation of the country, and Zhu Hui's post-epidemic economic recovery.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasised in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for everyone, so everyone needs to be mobilized to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Cheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, with internal forces as the mainstay, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation needs to involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and practices, and to promote digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and countries increasingly prosperous.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has called for increased leadership and guidance from all levels of government, institutions and enterprises in the development of digital technology, raising awareness of digital transformation, continuing to formulate and improve systems for digital transformation, strengthening national governance and promoting the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 Vietnam Manufacturing Excellence Digital Product Awards Ceremony and the opening of the Vietnam Manufacturing Digital Product Exhibition.

"Zhihui Xiaoxiang" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opens - Rolling News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhou Shuheng) On the 9th, the "Zhihui Xiaoxiang" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Zhuzhou.
Wang Cheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Director of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, attended the launching ceremony and delivered a speech.

Yangtze River Mainstream Achieves Full Coverage of Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had already built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognised by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River, and the pollutant reception and shipping service capacity of ships in the Yangtze River have been significantly improved.
According to reports, the green comprehensive service area on the water is an important facility that provides all-round production and life services for the majority of ships and crews, and helps the majority of crews solve the problem of "urgent difficulties and worries".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. The realization of "one-time mooring and multiple services" in the port will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media multi-dimensional report: The latest news on Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform," a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9th.
The Barabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea aboard the USS Carl Vinson.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US Navy carrier currently cruising the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdal".
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

According to CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception).
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam last Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysis said that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Visit Guam Rarely China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, and nuclear-tipped bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, with a market cap evaporating of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that they are "facing unprecedented competition," what could be the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue mainly comes from advertising, and today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustments to its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow an app to access their information; most people's normal reaction would be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it is there).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Chinese companies that do maritime business.
Meta has around a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets often find that Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, burning most of their money on Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte just two years ago.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new channels of traffic was not successful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just declining revenues, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets look not only at current income but also at future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "metaverse".
The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success and annual revenues of $10-20 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at the company, with no real safe harbour compared to other internet and tech companies.
Although his several social media apps now have high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand unified universe was so far out of reach that success in the short term was completely out of the question, making Facebook a very risky venture. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues was wrong and was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
