The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to credit?
Basically, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a look, just help out, just bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it's OK with him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this suits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours while he falls asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, at your discretion;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This confrontation with fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for Wi-Fi available.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
New Omikron cases are constantly causing concern for politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned, in view of rapidly increasing Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. Dpa
will the full amount of the purchase price be refunded upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by e-mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick any official's feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect when sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Tried first on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
They are now available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something a bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into frequent contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can not be helped or think we could not help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What good is the series to "League of Legends"?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, this did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the result itself was the manner of the performance.
To illustrate the dilemma, here is a statistic: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "We just weren't focused enough after the win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have consulted with legal counsel and have written to them again as a result.

Always looking sharp: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up their dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe loved to sing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly combed back and observant of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever happen again?

This is an absolute impudence
At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that it display case #NAME# is sold out.
That is a great pity.
Is it still in production?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery can not be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or placed a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, because I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has moved to a company about which he has blasphemed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I make a screen shot.

Help with your first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I'm currently leading the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the further action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabres
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears will stop the wagon.
Should it come to battle and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village schoolboy, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely heed many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
Can you then have the returns sent over so I can package up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, F1 takes precedence for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again ignorance of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
In general, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant antics that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So, in any case, the fantastic F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
This one: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several vents.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, so that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that nobody is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really tough time.
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometres
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-outing of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy head Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject itself quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
I of course had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study until my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear about great career opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and may be considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and training as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems like it's also available before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies make a bridging day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been too long and that can't be allowed?
Or because people in all seriousness want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What's the point of this self-hostage because of holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
Mind you, the stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent on it.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking cookies and making handicrafts with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
She still has a lot to do before the festive days: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I really have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting process and plumage regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Sorry, still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Modelleisenbahner ME Magazine 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this line.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with axle bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment potential of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, with the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining engines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were preferably built.
Only when it became apparent that the reprocessing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, did the E 95 come into focus for reprocessing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren locomotive depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the fireman who was constantly on board this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of failures of the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most splinter classes, so that the E 95s were decommissioned.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, they were followed by E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed internally in 1986.
The locomotive is being preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their efficient drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do?
I can't set up the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent?
No, no flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
For me, they are not flat
Could it be sent to me?
Hi #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has arisen, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over the further investigations.
But then it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend motivated him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused to do so because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He did not ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored again.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage would also have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary childcare places have been set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can not mount the base on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate your feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
will you send me the return slip by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inner side of the components which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component
Drag the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick brush swipes.
This results in unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touches.
Attach the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you moisten their back briefly with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper sideways.
Attention: Always check whether the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick, wrinkle or even tear on your finger.
Wipe away excess water with a household cloth.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me.
ok thanks anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But will I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing to pay.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet claim them with the private health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to best reach them again?
All right.
We will not order anything more from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment had been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clearly stated that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We are not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG #
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: an agreement in principle on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take domestic political costs into account.
The Belarusian society is apparently not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check that.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing the beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her front door.
Yesterday I gave up the contact form for returning an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all from our household.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
God has set all this in motion, as far as I'm concerned.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually without indexing and color errors up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some strange situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once a man is said to have even gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them for that purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module that broadcasts the wifi does not receive the full 500 anymore, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less it receives (so using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, with the new fiber optic connection, the Internet is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the savings account.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And has removed the desire to have a baby from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Raikkonen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo before the halfway point of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the premier class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. Dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second on Saturday, in which he drove from third to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took bigger risks today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also clinched his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously placing second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took her third victory of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What shall I do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired which annoys me very much.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again as it is currently reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was accepted yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe some other people feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also suffering from a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having a tummy ache right now, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have to do homework, which we obviously have to divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm doing okay.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently asking a lot of me; I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and I should at least prepare a bit for the anatomy class the day after tomorrow.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today but unfortunately the color is different and the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
What do you think about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English that I understand well
This has been a very long time, then I would refrain from doing so.
That's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can withstand much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already a "regular customer" with you and have bought many items already.
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand for warming!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight build-up of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion is placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensation.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incident involving the device shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up again despite the power adapter being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when plugged in?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the #PRS_ORG# to be delivered to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday objects you need remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal locking hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with top-down access – you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you want to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the assignment of the
Contact on the part of the forwarding agent announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will get an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME #
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics which are specific to certain windows and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is drawn up, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car through their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers so as not to go bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playstyle with the help of subtle adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates one half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the auctioneer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped in foil) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped, wrapped with fleece and wrapping paper).
If you are a collector then I can also send cardboard in a box for an extra charge of 2 euros, as there are 100% no printing points.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the elimination of mandatory testing for triple-vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.

What is the best way to do this?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated account data.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however u/Nitemarex had none by definition.**
Have misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money there.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
One more question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Won't I be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify here my life's gratitude".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the finals of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I got a taste for it and would like to cook roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set a beef fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What's next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do it
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't bought poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
It was already mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even provide a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally get yourself a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it does not work, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances I find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a break of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence in Germany
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day rate at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself.
I think an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It's time for change
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have entered a winter paralysis and have extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we are doing in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the German Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which will be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to do that now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Are there instructions for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and vegetarians reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan you get quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on site on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
Starting from February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a continuous increase in activity: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed, and re-downloaded the app and NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now hope for help.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

Thanks for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into any more detail than that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, however, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people on the right are naturally attracted to uniforms and weapons, and that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality. Of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, even if it sounds strange at first, represent a conservative attitude in my experience, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to please them, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing co-thinkers meet who have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally involved and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
We are still discussing my order which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
More orderly by child?
Hi, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and then and then I get motivated and I tidy up and clean.
But it is never really the case "that someone could spontaneously come to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been occupying me for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, fresh clothes are always there and the kitchen can be used.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work – as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been training for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in the open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything on the Internet.
The code review process is already causing problems for me (emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at this point.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean by return please !
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, the message appears "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book".
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its body's own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the renewal of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be switched back to.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of plumage regeneration is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry away from sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Also submitted a petition to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, I still have a sofa without any use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03 hrs), a car has crossed into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah okay I see.
Well, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is thinking up everything that can be thought of.
Before I start rambling here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I will not mention anything more detailed here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and I was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and finish at least the sketch, after that I can always switch direction.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely drained.
It's holidays now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally it's fun and from the outside it looks like the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I ask myself whether I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, where I could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter like now. but most of the time is the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't be back in the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You can tell that everything is kind of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
Of course, what ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they are protesting against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it annoys only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the St. Martin's custom with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled, according to the authorities in a vehicle, which could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« requires neither supply line nor batteries.
Place the "Glowstone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes ensure a firm grip if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At dusk, »Smart Stone« begins to light up automatically; in which colour, you decide for yourself: In addition to daylight white, you can choose from six attractive light colours.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I've done this several times it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will no longer order on principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
As for my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had explosive pimples during my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed on me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something someone can recommend to me.
Gynecologist has unfortunately not taken me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to a chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy, and low meat diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It could also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have problems everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else could be wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in black in large quantities

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothes.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them talk to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the above e-mail address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way to keep them for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
Sure, I already ordered the same chair in blue in November and got it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
and when would the pick-up be?
110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed in most shops.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about slumps in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there have been revenue losses at stores with non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping is not getting us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet they received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it shut.
What do I have to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory spaces, simply press one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switched on again - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Operating with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester installed - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking levers on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and tough use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it up, scored within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and won spectacularly 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top shape.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
Just now I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be reshipped directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Team Before Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round Group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not at height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-kick.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster up an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title prescribes, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely finished, it will then continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor present, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also no one "for whom everything has to go fast".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for road bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire was not willing to continue the rest of the journey at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really rather not have this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think that I have to change tires after 80-90kms when driving, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 € / tire now, only to be disappointed.
I'm also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that have this feature (apparently?), but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD based on my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skidding against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a matching designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Then you use a rotary milling cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leave it sticking out about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
By using the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed in place with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people via switch, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
