Sometimes it seems to me that through a translator my thoughts in Czech differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Hello, I agree to the course.
However, please indicate if there is an earlier time?
Because I do not live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no options, then I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived at the scene for dispersal with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against rallies and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor in the Donetsk region.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting - we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city - ed.) - people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, then we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, maybe, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we are not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes before the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to enter the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who took part in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha in Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!"
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the message says.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, massacres of civilians by the Russian military were recorded.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
General Prosecutor Irina Venediktova announced that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian occupiers.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops of invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

The place, date and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the animal attack on the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other again, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was expecting with sadness was happening...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have been consistently helping the UPA and never doubted that in the event of the occupation of the outskirts of Kyiv my family would not be spared.
Because I was and still am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy of his great-grandfather's execution case: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-court" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the pahar and the breadwinner of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were then taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the case file there is the surname of the plaintiff Sharie.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple does not fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that was sent to execute the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like "Immortal Barracks", qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and destroyed by the system.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, he was arrested and quickly died in prison.
KGBists are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed on top of the thousand-year Horde tradition.
And then over what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" of 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry because I don't have anyone to ask
I was also wondering if you know where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lyubosh, Igor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (it is a holiday and he can go, because the car has not been checked at the station yet).
We are very uncomfortable with bothering you so much.
You help us a lot, thank you!!

We talked about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee , the first question was how they found the dog, how they found a pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked me to send you their greetings and to say that they are very interested in reading the news.
We were talking about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.

Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people marry for various reasons, mostly selfish, mercantile goals.
I have a problem with this, if I don't love the person nothing will come of it.
Yes, we took it home and took it to our aunt right away.
She was very thankful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She asked if it was possible if there could be an old quilt and pillow too.
But it is not necessary . Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you .
I was certainly sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I've had a lot of questions for God as to why situations happen in my life that just made me despair of everything.
Are the little grocery stores open? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the arrangements.
This is so, but we are not yet oriented in the area and do not know where everything is.We today the supermarket looked for an hour and returned on foot.Two blankets are not suitable,so two and need a large size
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or does anyone else in the family?
It is possible for children to come to Vali and play in the lobby
Well, okay, let's take a chance then :)
I'm glad I met you too
For housing I talked to Vladimir and asked if I should wait until they find something or look for it myself. They also told me about the people who live with us and what we need to do to go to the metro station museum, where there is an institution that helps to find housing.
For the sake of a little one, I will cross the üòÇüôÉüòÇ barrier
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
So it would be great on Thursday, if possible.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license examination yet.
But I can't call him because I've run out of money in my account.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and it doesn't top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafon app I can't change the tariff to have normal calls and internet nor top up my number.
I'm already crazy

I'm embarrassed to be sitting idle.
I just wrote that at school in class
Sorry for bothering you, I was just very anxious.
And this is closer to knowing that they will arrive when they leave the borders of Ukraine.
For now, in everyone's life there is a question.
Okay. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I'm looking for everything for the home and for the child.
Thank the people who accepted me I live in a hut they always ask if I need something and I'm embarrassed to say I'm trying to find it myself.
I just came home, now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain, act like I'm not here.
Can't reply without a CV sent
I won't be able to tell my mother :)

I will write to you in any case.
Hi. Susan, help me. I got a payment for March. Is it for both of us with Yuliya or only for me, I can't figure out why such an amount.

I turned to Caritas, they offered temporary housing for a week or two but I need permanent housing where I could be with my child, and why there is less and less left
The flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone is rested and very nice.
According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles, citing the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular manner.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it us in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

Sorry I messed something up.
I didn't understand Czech so well at the time.
I probably came up with something for myself.
They really go to school like three because Galia and Sviatoslav study remotely and will finish school in Ukraine and get diplomas about graduation already in the fall. They need to apply to universities.
Tell me, how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman themselves solve issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are around.
Why not try this way for now
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

Maybe I can be something useful to them?
If possible, I would like to brush up on my math terms during the holidays.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make it error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope for this
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, at the bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stand aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance
it turned out that I ordered a spare card
Not worth it, I'm a simple person
So that she wouldn't think that nobody came.
I didn't go. Yes, she baked herself.  That's what I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves residents of cities blocked by it and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing it in real-time news.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you on the night
We agree, make an appointment for the tour, and write when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick only Lydia was not sick they had omicron a new kind of covid

I am using this ticket instead of a card.
Call for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the guide.
Serhii Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to decline, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member members - for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
Besides this, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Tough Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for free, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history and why security guarantees that are discussed in negotiations with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here?
In my Volt Partner it is indicated that my Application is under review.
I submitted it through this mobile application

Denis left today in a good mood.
I arranged with a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he could show him everything.

I'm leaving the children alone and waiting there for 3-4 years and then I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take it with you at 6-7 o'clock in the morning
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I wondered if I really needed to look at him differently.
And he invited me to get married, and died two days later.
Therefore, God Himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.

I understand perfectly well the value of unskilled labor and understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv I won't be able to have here and the money I earned at home I won't be getting here now either.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all the bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to keep myself busy with some physical activity.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of diversions and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians have been carrying out missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remnants of the Russian missiles, shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of the downed occupiers' rocket destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles utterly destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who had evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are horrified at the thought that NATO fighters will be shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered fraudsters.
The money you collect is better given to people in greater need.

You are calling to work to find out - to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last long.
Now.... will agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have 50$ in my pocket. We spent all of it at home.
Many of our supervisors did not give a salary for our work.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live ?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take anything with you from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know whether you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children around all of Prague.
What next? Unknown. How much? Unknown. The children ask for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.

We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to escape here.

These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go into the zone of military operations, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and on peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who, under fire, take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their free time they still volunteer, collecting first-aid kits to the front.

There are a lot of people in Warsaw at the visa application center and the on-line queue does not work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far away, it takes a lot of time to travel by train, it will be difficult for a child.
Therefore, I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.

Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak announced that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that are being transferred to us by our allies.
Yermak's quote: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "bring down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fake news is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering their weapons from allies, and it is massively switching to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn about such fakes right away.
Because weapons in the hands of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the garden would cost per month and will it work in summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after being occupied for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4th released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near a site that local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv." How the occupiers vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Truth" tracked down the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to find out how the "evacuation" itself takes place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their families.
However, according to the statements of the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At around 12 noon on the 24th of February they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, "Is there anyone?" ‚Äì I say yes. - "Come on!".
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."
This was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (who commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we lack.
We say that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the goods under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for eating.
So after they robbed the store they brought sausages and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich".
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they had come, because they did not want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a monster, Kadirov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there".
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought a kite for themselves, tied a Georgievskaya ribbon to one leg, their own white tape to the other and called it "opolchenka".
In Ukraine they came completely unprepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten at Buchi, so that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Furthermore, we had segregated enclosures - the Chechens did not know each other, on the first days they asked passwords to determine whether it was their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the OMSK desant.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - we constantly got into it from "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that there is no ZSU anymore, but there is "Azov", and, according to their words, there are a thousand 100 "Azovs" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - there was something about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go either way.
They replied: "Take care of the mental health of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" or with mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them did not go, saying that it was for the traitors of the fatherland - saying, "they will shoot you there, sell your organs".
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of cannons, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is fired, and a trace is seen - it was "Iscander" working in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "But no, these planes fly, turn around at the border."
But we are in aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His supervisor, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here I am, a hunchback, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they catch your thieves.
The poor people suffer!
We have such a great Lukashenko!
He will do as he says".
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì our daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and at the station in Minsk they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and provided with accompaniment.
They couldn't stay in the sanatorium by force.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to two weeks, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier that volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who were on the bus in Mozyr said that Russians were constantly shooting from the ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used to shell Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
We are currently registering and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian flags now."
Maryna lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle cannot - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as a guest!
Thank you for the agreement, lovely butterflies
And in this small apartment there is no wifi, mostly I answer all your questions but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
That is, will I live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is it a family that is ready to accept us?
The Quran states: "Even a leaf falls from its tree with His knowledge."
The children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, a general worker. Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and can work from home, and the other Mariana has no speciality, that is, a general worker.
Can you agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
The bodies and traces of torture were found of the head of the Motyzhyn village Olga Sukhonko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor ‚Äì in the sewers.
Near the tracks 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a shroud were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go then there will be no one at home

Yesterday they were supposed to deliver it to me, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and the DHL website says that the recipient could not be found.

She will forget her stop, or her phone, or like now she doesn't take her phone and hasn't written to me that she is in school and that everything is ok :)

I often share my thoughts with you. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Pravda".
"All the equipment, all that they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened or it would have looked different.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the support of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war," he added.
To recap, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and return to home

Why do people run away ?
Why do not live on the territory where there is no war ??
Are you in your mind ??
Did you live in a belligerent state ?
When prices soared by 100-200%.
When most businesses are NOT WORKING.
When there is no place to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like that ?

If you find out too - it will be a SHOCK.

Everyone was sick and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now a woman from Damelido called me and said that they sent me information about further actions to my email but I didn't give any response.
She spoke Czech and I understood her that way.

There are also many nuances in men.
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my own point of view on life I met him, then left him.
He was a very rich man, After a while he called and informed him that he had heart surgery.
Asked me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me
"There was a car in my yard, I looked like a crocodile, and I was letting hailstones.
And they kept me in the house, then led me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
As for the housing, what photos did you send?
I haven't gotten there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working normally.
Is there a dress code at work or not, can I wear what I have?
Okay, he'll come there and pick them up.
I'm not greedy for everything
I understand that I can't sit here with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, not interesting for me at all
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived for? Is he okay?
Diana didn't answer me and you
Okay, I just need to print out drawings for the kids. So that will be great. When can I come?
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I hope you are satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but is studying in the Czech Republic, majoring in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a moment with your children calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me. Wake up beside you.
In general, it is hard to be in a foreign country, and with each day it becomes more and more desirable to go home.
Ms. Agatha, if you need this photo, then I'll take a picture.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to blurt out too much when they call."
"For a whole month we hide information about the war from our mother-in-law.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in Plamky (cat - UP) the fur on the belly and back legs is thinning - this can be due to stress, changes in diet and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The plamka, unlike the svekruha, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid both the war and the fact that I was nearby ‚Äì formally coming as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time the stepmother spends in her room.
She hears badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone she communicates with. That's 6-7 people.
She asked him to talk to her about anything but not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th is when I'm cleaning two apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)
Hi,if tomorrow we need more help we can come
Do I have to order lunch or can I bring it from home? Do I need to print these documents or will they be printed on site and I will sign them?
I offer men's, women's and children's haircuts with a visit to you, all interested please write in personal messages, price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I will still look here.
I'm telling you the embassies are only here,
The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier who is a member of the Ukrainian Navy Marine Brigade taking part in the defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Eidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC citing Eislin's family members and friends, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Eislin who spoke to him
According to Eislin's twitter: "We received news from him: "48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food and ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is taking part in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of serviceman En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brenan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone conversation, Eislin said about their unit's plans to surrender.
The brigade ran out of ammunition and food, he said.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of detachments of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a phone conversation was circulated on social networks, in which allegedly Eyslin talks to his American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The Bolshevik attackers played to the fullest for their losses in battle.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, the boy Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit filled with earth".
According to the memoirs, "there was some kind of dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house.
The bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were always found on the streets
And maybe I'll really follow you. I need you. I can't without you.
What personal activity/activity has helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

Lena, the things that didn't fit us in size, can we give them back to you or give them to Kate?

I sleep for 4-5 hours for now, but I am already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I am not afraid of work, since I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can we bring the items?
You have a very interesting tradition, we have it on Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy."
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the hypothetical Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know of any company that has had the need to physically hold board meetings at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The one that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
What's more - if one harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow other bills may be passed - for example, the system of state procurements through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be destroyed.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, let us examine the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation due to the risks of losing the internet and other communication tools, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect against the loss of the ability of the supervisory board to make decisions, but rather on the contrary will lead to it!
People's deputy, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned defense industry enterprises that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in UKROBORONPROM, which, in fact, manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in UKROBORONPROM, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocate a particular defense enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro also makes arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts, at the first word "war", leave Ukraine back in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
Firstly, it is a manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims against the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavluk's direct words: "In the settlements of the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the oblastVA, it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot at this time.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clean and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
The school has not sent me anything yet, only a payment receipt.

The Serbian defence budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.
if you don't mind I would come
That's how we registered ,but it's hard to live in a hostel here and it's not very convenient for my son .I would like to go to the village.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the forceful support of the SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained and one was wounded.
According to "Viasna", the men resisted actively and tried to escape when detained.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with on-site medical care.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railways, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources "BZD" in VKontaktiye and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
To recap: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring, in order to fight, live forces and equipment to Ukraine.

The United States bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions on the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia's largest banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that are related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector exodus includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step in the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the latest part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the passage is closed and I will approach you
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the car?

We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.

I am also very sad
Let me remind you of the texture later
Does only your dad speak and understand Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do the cleaning of the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed that I distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically researches the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna presented on the morning of April 12 a video recording that was sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military say they have no weapons left to fight with, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social networks that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we are staying here
2 driving time )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here
A squadron ofüá®üáø Czech drones has started flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to the Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today their inter-village friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for the purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities, where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of drones - the places of their deployment will remain a secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, they say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I like sweet things, but I can do without them.
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.
I'm soon returning to Ukraine to work.
Well. If all goes well, I'll agree
I will try to do it myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the presence of the elder in the village in Ivano, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing.
Perhaps she will be delighted and her mood will rise
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm going to freeze on the street today too.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.

Today it was cooler and rainy. Tomorrow should be warm.
But do not feel sorry for the destroyed houses, sorry for the people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, perhaps something else needed to be given

How will I be credited for the day I was absent from work is a leave of absence.
Headquarters summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to replenish the personnel losses of the battalions of the tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaikalsky Krai) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
The enemy is particularly facing a problem in staffing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmitrovka, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to launch an assault in the Golden area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the sea port with the help of artillery and aviation.
By the forces of some units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to have time, but I doubt
And you want to sleep but I will keep you.
You definitely don't mind me coming?
If you just don't feel like seeing each other today, just tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up :)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
My tariff package for the month is ending today :)
Can we do that today by phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this field.
I will ask her. I'm a bit embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, so Google wrote something on its ownüèµÔ∏è. , I think the phone numbers are enough.
Good day, we took the things you brought, but there are some things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If the director agrees, then I can start working from next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because the queues are very long) and on Saturday it will rain :)
I am looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I am studying Czech language to fully know, I dream of working in Prague.
Friends old and not so old, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which was already never easy, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is being subjected on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive strike.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you in a bit, - Sasha replied as usual, concisely. - Now after the search we are going through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you - those who worked in "Memorial", in "Novaya Gazeta", in "Echo of Moscow", in "Meduza", in Navalny's organization and in a few other places - how many of you did something to oppose this regime?
Except perhaps to participate in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your enduring indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which have now probably placed a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you possessed freedom and democracy to some extent ‚Äì messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are ultimately overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek refuge behind the back of a king, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems to you that it is safer near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and exposing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you devoted your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and dutifully came to terms with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me: "Enough, we are already tired of your Chechnya". I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn good money, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is it a disaster?
Moscow sparkled and glittered with splendor.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and terrified of what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev and himself took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia blatantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
Nevertheless, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you finally woke up.
When Putin swapped places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt terrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
He then struck back in response.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I have heard this so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they seized the Maidan once and never left it.
They built a tent camp entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little use for it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth arose, and many of you who had been mocking Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and started to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were new to books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, all new after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their benches, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In truth, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers shooting my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of innocent civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äì like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most can speak out from abroad, some - from within the country, like Marina Ovsiannikova, risking to end up in a new GULAG or to join Navalny's company.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, what seems very likely, if he fails - he will turn to you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and are still serving a minor term, but soon will get a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given for a joke are not so far in the past - and now, with a high probability, they await you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more than in 2014 ‚Äì scares Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing on paper his superiority.
All in all, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is still going on.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on the lookout.
You understand where this is all going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a sham, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media are gone, your economy is crumbling faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket on a plane abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either to go somehow or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains another one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is engulfing Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has already happened from time to time, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which mode can be limited, but which still works and which can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was crushed, but others can be created, more informal, more decentralized.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If it comes out to be more than 300 thousand, she will be amazed.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it gets to the point?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will experience understandable fear; Those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only continue to intensify, acquiring more and more scales.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be at home
That you perceive me as a press secretary
Vico, how often do you go to dinner in an expensive restaurant?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked the very beautiful one and we wanted something closer so this is the best option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I was tired energetically.
I feel bad, coughing, fever, lost voice, weakness and dizziness.
I have to go to that labor government
We have already done this,but said who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
On Thursday, a pass is required, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I got a letter from a lady who liked your work and she wanted something from you in her house.
