Dogara said that after he suffered the humiliation of the PDP Governor Bala in Bauchi State, which he helped end up winning the 2019 general elections, he decided to quit the party and go to the APC.
The main reason why I left is the way pdp rule in bauchi state.
Everyone knows the role I played in the governorship election which former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed Abubakar, lost to.
I'm also now a part of the government's
Instead of staying in the eu, I'd like to go back to where I came from.
He wrote a letter from the PDP which he sent to the chairman of the party's constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.

During freedom radio's visit to the site, she found a large number of security personnel and security personnel everywhere, as the location is related to the main bus station known as Kuka Station, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and neighbouring countries of the country.
In addition to the water gate business that has been popular in northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio has been speaking to some eyewitnesses, who said the fire had caused a high risk of survival among the people.
A police officer at the water station said they were working with patrol officers to save passengers who were in panic following the fire.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, saying that as of the time we are gathering information to ascertain the cause and damage caused by the fire, the spokesman, Si'iam Muhammad Ibrahim, said.
On the other hand, there were reports that there were some bandits who tried to break into the water gate to steal, but police and police officers tried to drive them out and secure public property.
In this case, we have contacted the Spokesman of the Kano State Police Command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
Coronavirus: We have not yet tested the efficacy of the vaccine in Nigeria.
While countries in Europe continue to test the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, Nigeria has not been left behind in its own trials of the drug.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has said it is testing up to 40 covid-19 drugs that have been reported to the agency by traditional drug makers.
The Chairman of the Commission, Mojisola Adeyeye, made this known in Abuja on Tuesday.
Mojisola said that the quality of the drugs is being tested so as not to seek revenge.
Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional drug makers have conducted research to ensure that they are not left behind to find a cure for the disease.
Many of them have submitted their treatment to the authority for testing and validation.
The FDA also provides guidelines and guidelines for the use of the drug.
Animal testing will be conducted for the first time.
Mojisola warned the medical community not to try a drug without the agency's permission.
In May, NAFDAC said that only social media outlets and newspapers have seen stories of those claiming to have found a traditional drug that will cure the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that only one person had asked NAFDAC to check the efficacy of the drug, which he claimed to include traditional medicine, which he said could cure the coronavirus.
It's not the same as the one that Gideon said.
He was trying to find a cure for the symptoms.
Since then, some of the medical professionals have been re-reading their own.

The APC accuses the government of attempting to disrupt the party - The Head of The Hawai'i Media.
In a statement issued on Tuesday by the All Progressives Congress (APC) this week, the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to cause riots in the party.
The circular, signed by national chairman of the National Engineering Council, Muhammadu Jibrin Imam and The National Secretary of the Barista Muhammed Liman, states that during the six years of the party's tenure, N512 million was only n512 million.
The statement further said that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend, would help to further the cause of the party's riots, saying they had written to the party's national secretariat on developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand that the Niger State Governor is trying to divide the party's members by organizing a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, because any complaint against the party's leadership is to write to the party's secretariat for investigation".
He said that in the six years after the party's inception, N512 million had been in the party's account.
He said what he understood as governor was to be part of a national caretaker committee set up on July 25, 2020, headed by the president to guide the process of resolving disputes between members of the party and withdrawing the grievances in court among members of the party.
How do we pay the salaries of the employees? As well as other party-related activities, primaries, and other party-related problems such as medical support due to lack of access to government support, not a party's illegal spending, we challenge anyone to justify the party's ill-treatment.
As I have explained, The last local government primaries are the most important primaries in the country, with the former Commissioners and Commissioners currently in power in all the twenty-five local government areas of the state, with the money spent in the elections distributed to the Commissioners to bring their constituencies.
Therefore, it is a mistake for anyone to have the party's funds being spent illegally, that is almost unfair and to try to give the wrong protection to the wrong people trying to hang it up, that no committee has been set up to investigate how the party's money was spent and who set up it.
Of the money that the complainer said was misused, it was money donated by the National Secretariat of the National Party, and I challenge anyone on this matter to prove his claim in any way.
Who are we to stand in the way of the anoint of the APC? He added that any allegation against a party or any party leader from the state level would be written to the Zonal Committee as set out in Section 21 (B) (b) (d) on page 82 of the party's Constitution.
Therefore, the party's stakeholders have no role to play especially if they attempt to strip the committee's power so their judgment has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most effective party leaders in the state, on page 21 and 6 of page 87 of the party's constitution.
It's a mistake to make decisions with the leaders.
He said those who presented with confidence to hear the book at the non-conference, which was presented by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party is chaired by the party's chairman, Mohammed Imam, and not by the governor to preside over the state party leaders.
According to the statement, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the elections, and the journey with the party's parents in government so that everyone can benefit in the state and all the other areas through political office, which is the problem for the governor and the party.
The document also praised members of the National Assembly who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to the resolution of all disputes among the party's members, which came as no surprise to lawmakers who are aware of their headaches, who refused to accept falsehood as the party's code of conduct.
Therefore, it is necessary for the Chairman of the National Executive Committee to focus on governor Abubakar Sani Bello's position in the right place not to attempt to subdue the politics of the state.

Food insecurity is a health problem in Nigeria
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that are used to prevent food from being damaged, that eating such foods is harmful to human health.
The study was conducted after a study on the quality of food in the country.
The results show that there are certain foods that are used to prevent them from getting burned.
Research has also shown that this is most commonly used in beans, alabo town and dried fish that are served to the general population.
The idea is to use it because it is used by a person who is willing to use it.
Then eat foods containing these nutrients that cause diabetes, diabetes, heart attack, and so on.
People are urged to take precautions to avoid the use of these types of food for their health.
A food quality expert, Grace Olasumbo, has urged Nigerians to abstain from foods that have been crushed with calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used by marketers to make fresh fruit.
Research has shown that shortness of patience and patience are among the factors that make traders use this chemical because it shows off fruit products in one day.
Olasumbo explained that one of the things that marketers fail to understand is the use of this chemical to show the desired products for the health of people even more so.
As a result, there are diseases including mother's and baby's teeth, eye pain, sore throat, mouth, liver, etc.

China has achieved the success of its people's food and livelihoods - The Head of The Hausa Newspaper
Food is the lifeblood of all living beings, except for food.
This is why the Chinese government is committed to ensuring the nation's food and food security.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has made significant progress in food security, surprising the world in its population, which is estimated to have surpassed 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has contributed to China's greatest contribution to combating world hunger, according to Zhang Wufeng, the head of the Food and Agriculture Organization of China, once stated that from 1949 until now, China has always put hunger at the heart of all its activities.
But lately, some people and some western media have again "expressed concern" over whether China can raise its own people in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world?
We are very grateful to them for the constant support they have given us in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved enough food production based on its man-made efforts.
The supply of chinese food is one of the main agendas of the Ruling People's Party (CPC) every day.
Over the weekend, chinese President Xi Jinping issued an executive order to stop food waste, saying that everyone knows that all food and labor is to be done.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also taking a toll on the Chinese economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
China's national statistics on the number of agricultural products In particular, the country's rice availability in 2020 showed that the total volume of rice produced in the country in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, increasing by 1.08 million tons, which is a 3.9% increase compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, former chairman of the National Agricultural University of China, said China has made significant progress in terms of food security compared to the start of the era of domestic change and opening up to the international community.
Huang Jikun, director of The Institute of Agricultural Policy at Peking University, said in an interview with "The China Science Daily" that the biggest challenge China faces in the next two or three years is whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores.
The average number of eggs per person is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world would get every year.
China now import tens of millions of tons of agricultural products exclusively for domestic livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should be calm, wash their clothes, or focus on the affairs of their home country.
The Chinese are able to produce their own food.
That's why I'm trying to bring Ganduje to court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The Kano Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) Abba Kabir Yusuf has explained his reasons for the prosecution of Kano Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje and others before the State High Court.
Kabir disclosed this through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who said he filed the case on the basis of alleged ownership of some government buildings benefiting the people of Kano State.
In addition to kano governor and businessman, Abba Kabir Yusuf also appealed to the Ministry of Works, Housing and Transportation, The Attorney General, Kano State Commissioner of Justice and the State Land Administration.
Abba Yusuf accused the Kano state government of taking ownership of some of the former Daula hotel currently under the supervision of wudil university of science and technology and the Shahuci University, which he said was in line with the provisions of the law.
It will only be available in 2023.
Brother and best friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has said that the style of governance in Nigeria is old fashioned.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already committed to now abandoned the pick-take system in the interest of the most deserving election in 2023.
The bbc has written an interview with her mother.
This process of re-election in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-witness child, which has been in place since 1999.
Instead, the government has said it is necessary to decide who is eligible until the process is followed by the recovery process.
However, the Igbo tribe, the Inyamirai, has reacted to the statement.
They said that he and his brother, Buhari, had just won the re-reins by taking over the throne and that he would go out and suggest that it should not be done in 2023.
Buhari is not the only one elected by Nigerians.
In the same way, the high-security forces who have been in the country for many years have not been removed from their jobs and are not more likely to be able to do so.
Martha's waiting.
A political storm of the Nigerian presidency on Wednesday, as the Igbo Zalla People's Protection Corps ( Ndigbo) has taken on Mamman Daura, over the president's boat speech to the Inyamurai tribe.
In a meeting with Daura, who is a cousin of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that there would be a plan for the 2023 presidential election.
Since the end of the war, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement of dishonor to Mamman Daura, calling it a "smattering of anti-corruption."
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the group is a member of the Igbo people of the South South, while south-east zone will be allowed to run for president in 2023, the Igbo ethnic group.
The spokesperson of the Chairman of the Zalla Igbo Tribe, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's comments were similar to the 2023 presidential race against the Igbos.
So why didn't I mention that I'm not a mom since 2019?
They were about to oust Jonathan, and Now Daura is the candidate for the south who will be the president of Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
He is now in the hands of his brother and is going to come up with something we don't know we're going to pick up in 2023.
It should be done as an elder to hold on to the truth.
Not to mention the 2023 presidential election, but the president's statement is self-righteous and self-righteous.
A vote of the vote
The issue of violence against women and children by rape is very prevalent in northern Nigeria, with reports of violations of children's rights.
On July 23, 2020, people from all sides gathered to discuss how the situation in the country is getting worse and how it can be overcome.
Participants of the hall relate to issues such as the promotion of girls' promotion and the adoption of other mothers.
One of the mothers who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of the former Governor of Plateau State and Niger state during the late Sani Abacha regime, has described poverty as one of the factors that make parents give money to their children.
Mary, the son of Mary, said to him, "We have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit."
We are also calling on teachers to start preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who rape their children and their families.
The Member of the House of Assembly representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse Constituency of Kebbi honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed displeasure with the matter and supported the implementation of a law that would criminalise anyone convicted of rape in the country.
At the end of the meeting, Hajiya Dauda and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who presided over the meeting, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of VOA for their invitation.
The "Northern Writers" of the North
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, oppressors, and others, have long played a role in creating dialogue, collaboration and social interaction between different nations around the world, with the delivery of messages, news, and political, educational and business goals.
Young Nigerians have taken part in this new technology by using social media, to travel with the latest, to contribute, or to contribute to the cause of their lives.
We can say that these steps have brought us a lot of development that the Northern youths are benefiting from in the business, economic, educational and political aspects of the region.
Many of them are making money by writing and posting messages on the internet, finding jobs or developing their own projects.
However, it is unfortunate that instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to take advantage of the progress that has been made, there have been some who have followed the corrupted south who have been in the world to defraud the people, both inside and outside the country, or to write in sins and abuses of the rulers and their predecessors.
A lack of transparency in the lives of young people
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers Association in the country is a great opportunity to provide the Northern youths with a positive direction, a positive direction and to clean up the activities of the youth in Midaya Soshiya, so that they can write and share the goals of the Northern people.
We need to give this group the unity it needs to achieve its good goals, which will bring blessing not only to our northern region but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I would like to advise our youths, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its independence, and to develop a system that will make it easier for all.
As with our northern leaders who have slept well, such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Prime Minister of the North, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close friends are committed to delivering for the people of the North.
The late anti-poverty and anti-poverty president, Aminu Kano, has said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house.
We therefore say that, as we call for national development and the promotion of governance, at every level, we call for the unity of northernpeople, free from any religious or ethnic discrimination, to bring the region forward.
The current state of the North
Therefore, we need to use god's wisdom and wisdom to help the people of the north to develop their economy.
The North should provide revenue sources to carry out its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide financial support.
In addition to the development of the North, we have given importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
If we don't make money, there are different ways to do it.
We believe that this is the way we are going to achieve our goals.
It's a pride of north.
The government has earmarked N126 billion for the rehabilitation of the country's hospitals.

The hospitals to be repaired include FMC hospitals, disease testing facilities, emergency care department, non-communicable diseases and teaching hospitals in the 36 states of the country.
Over the past few years, several health experts have called on government departments to work together to set aside sufficient funds to improve the health sector in the country.
The experts made the call at a conference on the provision of safe and accessible health care to the people held in Abuja.
In a speech, senatorial candidate representing Kwara North on the Platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sadiq Umar said the Nigerian government should take matters of improving the health of the country very well.
The lack of money in this sector has led to a lack of financial support in the country, which is why it relies heavily on foreign aid.
Umar said that despite the support received, the government did not play a role in the health sector, which led to the withdrawal of the support they were providing.

Dabiri made the claim after the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel.
The suspect, a Nigerian, has been killed and no further details have been heard.
The killing of Ibrahim Khaleel will serve as a lesson for parents to stop sending their children around the world, being killed in vain, especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that people don't know that the whole world is not allowed to be in North Cyprus.
The United Nations does not recognize
But thousands of Nigerians live in their own country, but hundreds of thousands of Nigerians are killed in the country.
She is also trying to make the list of hundreds of Nigerians who have been killed in the country.

Only a few of the deaths were of short-term causes, not death.

The Senator representing Kaduna Central, Father Sani, who attended the meeting, appealed to non-residents of Kaduna to recant their comments before making their comments.
This problem has been going on for more than 40 years.
For the first time, the government had put an end to the war.
But because of the way some people are based on the actual story, many people only hear one part of it other than the other.

At a time when farmers are about to take advantage of their crops in Nigeria, farmers in sokoto state have begun to complain about the threat posed to them by birds, which could threaten the expected crop.
The threat of birds in the Sokoto state region of the state is on the rise again, with signs of a healthy food season in 2020.

He said he couldn't open his mouth to question how the state government was run until he was accused of disobedience, so he removed the shoes to get out of the party.
The former Senate President said that if he holds his hands in the fight that whatever the situation is deteriorating in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed administration, it will be a matter of trust, after then Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar all heard his voice express his views when it went wrong.

He said that over 1 million small-batch farmers were part of the Farmers Group under six companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
Soon we will be introducing the second Group B, which will benefit from this agricultural program.
Nanono recalled how President Muhammadu Buhari set up a Committee on Economic Recovery and Development from the deformations he experienced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

He said the programme contained the government's plan to distribute 100,000 metric tonnes of food to the programme to help the most vulnerable from malnutrition and hunger during the coronavirus pandemic.

A new law is being debated on the registration of places of worship in Nigeria.
SERAP, a human rights and economic development activist group, SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend the registration of places of worship.
According to the PolicyP, this is a violation of human rights as contained in the Constitution of Nigeria.
Before human rights groups complained about the move, various religious leaders had also complained to the Buhari government, saying that the law should be re-introduced to the national assembly for review and confirmation so that it would not be in violation of the provisions of the Constitution of religion and welfare.
Pastor Yohanna Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna State, told VOICE OF AMERICA that the law has no basis for arms, and it is not without any basis if the government is seeking to ban worship or sanction.
It just has to be done by monitoring and monitoring all violations of the law without any new legislation.
Dr. Bashir Yankuzo, a cleric at the University of Science, Minna, said while there is nothing wrong with the government's monitoring of companies and organizations for national security, it does not mean that the freedom of others will be diminished.
The question is whether the government will listen.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has been trying to get past the premium times website.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken control of a major cyber-attack, for the downing of PREMIUM TIMES, nigeria's most popular online newspaper.
This web-based web browser has tried to use all the techniques that users use to access their websites, but to no success.
He began hacking on February 28, 2014, when he hacked into the university's premises and attacked the university with "data."
On the other hand, if he tried to break into PREMIUM TIMES's database with a computer, he also launched another attack on his GSM phone.
Five days ago, he had been trying to enter the grand entrance of the Premium Times Headquarters, but was unsuccessful, despite using a variety of modern technology.
He did not succeed in getting into it, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a good plan for it, which had built a wall and a gate built by an informer was not enough to break it.
It also has a number of modern internet security services including the King of War Premium Times and the Grand Dakar, Premium Times Web Server.
These security agents have the latest experience in crushing any group of attackers or other bardens that seek to be alone, or to make an attempt to break through the PREMIUM TIMES Database.
The types of cyber attacks that are targeted at the time of the attack are:
At 8:00 a.m., he started to sit at the front of the front door, and saw how he was going to get inside.
He failed in the night, the next morning, at 6:15 and then again tried the hour, this time using "WPScan", which is done to detect the strength or weakness of high-level internet security measures such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to attempt to break into the latest technical version of the "custom script".
In the morning, he did everything he could to get the best out of the box.
How the Farm Man's Solution
It's not clear to me that this is the first time that The New York Times has been in the news that the major cities in the world are shutting down or shutting down the internet.
It's the lack of awareness that has led to all the tools that he used, completely identical to those that were not able to do premium times any harm or harm.
That same day, he suffered from fatigue because he had to go on a DDOS attack on the NTP Special Forces, which is the oldest method used since Kano village.
On March 3, he tried all his imaginations and imaginations, but he was unsuccessful.
The attempt to break down the door of PREMIUM TIMES Headquarters comes a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published the news of a contract of contract between President Muhammadu Buhari's adviser on Security, Babagana Monguno and former Chief of Staff to the President, the late Abba Kyari.
Some within the Federal University of Technology, Akure, told PREMIUM TIMES that the university had hired a large group of rats on the internet to vandalise, vandalise or destroy the site.
However, the University of New York City's high school has been in contact with the University of New York, and has been trying to get the high school diploma.
He said that unless a student is a student of the university, he is not a student.

It's a matter of self-determination and self-determination that is at the heart of our business - The Guardian.
Longyuan village is located in Hongsipu District of Wuzhong city in Ningxia Province of the Hui people in northwestern China.
Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) is famous for her struggle in life and for her success in her struggle to escape poverty.
Her story tells us that self-determination and self-determination are at the heart of everything.
At first, Li Yaomei or Siya had never sat in class to take a lesson, so she could not read or write.
God's wisdom, wisdom, and wisdom are the only examples of god's wisdom.
About 20 years ago, Mrs. Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, having had three stomach surgery.
After her healing, she had a serious accident, and now she is walking with a metal frame attached to her foot.
The challenges she faced put her in a difficult position in addition to health, as well as the cost of treatment, for which she received a loan of about 300,000 Yuan, the equivalent of over N16 million.
What's remarkable is that this woman's experience has become a way to make her feel better.
The chinese government's support for the government has increased its support.
His job is to make a variety of kinds of
Due to her husband's efforts, my father's business was very much in development, where various employees gave her a piece of clothing.
He has also created a number of machines that help him to simplify the process.
For example, it took about 15 minutes to attach a single large data point, but now in this time, it will connect up to 5 steps.
In addition, she has added a new set of products that will help with the re-use of the product.
There's a lot of food that is being sold to women, and it's still being sold to those who are looking for them.
Given the challenges faced by the teacher, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the student has to find it.
The fight against poverty and the well-being of the poor is not an easy task.
If the government is going to provide support, but people have no desire or desire to improve their living by looking for jobs based on their situation, then it will continue to be done without a goal.
Her article shows that conducting a business or income-earning job does not require some kind of income or travel to other cities or countries.
As a result, she took advantage of the benefits of her environment for the betterment of her life.
In addition, the teacher, Sadiya, carried out these tasks on the basis of standing on her feet without trusting her husband, in order to run away from her.
In other things, self-determination and self-determination are at the heart of what is at stake.
It is the power of women to change their lives and to stand up for their lives without asking for help.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever a person can do, he must stand by his or her own beliefs, because the trust of someone else is uncertain.
She was a great teacher, a great teacher, and a role model for all of us.
As of March this year, Malama Sadiya had completed the payment of all the arrears and stopped receiving support from the government on its own.

The U.S. government is trying to stop covid-19 - The Washington Post
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, He expressed concern about the steps some countries are taking to preserve the covid-19 vaccines expected to be produced, saying preferences on the communities of different countries must be avoided while sharing the vaccine.
And the vaccine should be distributed across the globe, as it would be suitable for the benefit of many different countries.
In fact, some U.S. politicians are implementing a policy of prioritising their own interests in the sharing of vaccines, as well as hurting international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already surpassed 23 million.
The death toll has reached more than 800,000.
Under such severe circumstances, more attention is being given to the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the good news is that, in recent times, significant results have been found in the study of the vaccine in other countries, a case that has provided hope, and belief for the entire international community.
But sadly, some U.S. politicians have expressed their desire to take the vaccine.
"Science" has even clarified that the U.S. government has already signed agreements to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the U.S. government's policy is understood to be the leading cause of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need higher doses, considering that they are more likely to have poor health resources.
The environmental magazine also suggests that if the U.S. achieves the goal of reducing the production of the vaccine, the number of vaccines produced in developing countries will decline.
The Director-General of the Centre for Disease Control of Africa CDC, John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some commentators have noted, even if the vaccine has been successfully developed, it is impossible to achieve the goal of seeing after the pandemic, until the distribution of the vaccine is planned, which is a very important issue for the international community.
It is important for the international community to promote
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that if it is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be curbed from all sides of the world, and it is impossible for other parts of the world, or even a few countries, to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the pandemic alone.

Tope, however, reminded the judge that he had brought the case directly to court, and not any other prosecution by the police.
He said it was the responsibility of all the people involved.
He did what the Nigerian law allows him to do in court.
The judge adjourned the hearing and ordered the court to resume on August 4 for further hearing.
