In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived at the scene for dispersal with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against rallies and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor in the Donetsk region.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelenskyy: Mariupol is the heart of war, it will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have pulled away a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, then we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, maybe, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... Every family has lost something ‚Äì and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we are not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes before the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to enter the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Everyone Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the message says.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, massacres of civilians by the Russian military were recorded.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kyiv region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal mockery of civilians north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other again, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was expecting with sadness was happening...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and still am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy of his great-grandfather's execution case: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-court" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the pahar and the breadwinner of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were then taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KDBist informant.
An apple from an apple tree is not far away, as you know, falling...
The shooting troika, dooming the peasants to execution, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like "Immortal Barracks", qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and destroyed by the system.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and there he quickly died.
KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed on top of the thousand-year Horde tradition.
And then over what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" of 1992, that's how it was.
Zo you saw my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy for cough .

Yes, we took it home and took it to our aunt right away.

But it is not necessary . Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you .

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles, citing the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular manner.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it us in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

For me, marriage is the sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.

Maybe I can be something useful to them?

Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks

Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, at the bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stand aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.

I didn't go. Yes, she baked herself.  That's what I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves residents of cities blocked by it and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the shootings at Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing it in real-time news.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you on the night
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be collected

Serhii Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member members - for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the "Oath Issues" podcast, together with the editor of The European Pravda, we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia,  may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I wondered if I really needed to look at him differently.
And he invited me to get married, and died two days later.
Therefore, God Himself decided our destinies.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's quote: "We see attempts at sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians have been carrying out missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed rocket of the occupiers smashed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles utterly destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who had evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on Russian territory in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the Russian army's brutality against civilians.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered fraudsters.

A foreign electoral district of Ukraine (HEI) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located. [1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas constituency is played by the Central Election Commission.
Only national voting is held in the Foreign constituency: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in higher education institutions are not held.

Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia was launching a "fake operation" on weapons that allies were transferring to us.
Yermak's quote: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "bring down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense system transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it is massively moving into service with the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after being occupied for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" on charges of Ukraine's dissemination of "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near a site that local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv." How the occupiers vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" found the removed Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to the Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was a civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, "Is there anyone?" ‚Äì I say yes. - "Come on!".
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (who commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext "all equally Russian zaberut" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for eating.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
Chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äì their own white tape and called it "militia".
In Ukraine they came completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have what, do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They delivered 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly fell into it from the Bayraktars.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is so thousand 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want either there or there.
To which they replied: "Then feel sorry for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äì either "Grads" or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that this is for traitors to the motherland ‚Äì they say, "you will be shot there, they will sell you to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A rocket fires, and a trace is visible ‚Äì it worked "Iskander" in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "But no, these planes fly, turn around at the border."
But we are in aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
Its leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I am a khokhol, I am from Chernigov.
But I think that Putin with Lukashenko will not stay, poka —ç—Ç–∏—Ö your vorov will not achieve.
Bad people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He's like he says, so be it."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì our daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports, no one would take anyone to the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
In the sanatorium by force was not kept.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier that volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there were constantly firing from the training grounds.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used to shell Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian flags now."
Maryna lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äì there is no house anymore.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center you can't ?
Thank you, we have everything.And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thanks for the arrangement, the bloodworms are beautiful
And in this small apartment does not catch Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions and now I don't know what to do?And children from Monday have classes online, but there is no Internet.
That is, will I live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is it a family that is ready to accept us?

Can you agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the headman of the village Motyzhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor ‚Äì in the sewers.
On both sides of the highway, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go then there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Pravda".
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment, it's done late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened or it would have looked different.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war," he added.
To recap, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and return to home

Are you in your mind ??
Did you live in a belligerent state ?
When prices soared by 100-200%.
When the number of enterprises DOES NOT WORK.
When there is no place to earn.
When do children hear PVO ?
Did you live like that ?
You don't even have an imagination.
And God forbid that they should not have.
If you also find out - it will be HORROR.

Everyone was sick and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just a certain woman from DameIdlo called me and said that they dumped information about further actions on my e-mail and I never gave an answer.

He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my own point of view on life I met him, then left him.
He was a very rich man, After a while he called and informed him that he had heart surgery.
Asked me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me
"There was a car in my yard, I looked like a crocodile, and I was letting hailstones.
And they kept me in the house, then led me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And what about housing,that you dropped the photo
I haven't gotten there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already denied this fake.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to blurt out too much when they call."
"For a whole month we hide information about the war from our mother-in-law.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, Spots (cat ‚Äì UP) have fur peeled off on the belly and hind legs ‚Äì this can be due to stress, food changes and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The speck, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid both the war and the fact that I was nearby ‚Äì formally coming as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always by the bedside.
My mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She hears badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I could hear the sound of her "walkers," I was hiding in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
I asked to talk to her about anything, just not war.
I will ask my friend she has been there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)
Hi,if tomorrow we need more help we can come
Lunch must be ordered, is it possible to take lunch from home?These documents need to be printed, or will they be printed there on the spot and I will sign?

I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I will still look here.
I'm telling you the embassies are only here,
The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Eidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC citing Eislin's family members and friends, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Eislin who spoke to him
According to Eislin's twitter: "We received news from him: "48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food and ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the serviceman, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brenan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone conversation, Eislin said about their unit's plans to surrender.
The brigade ran out of ammunition and food, he said.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of detachments of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his friend an American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The Bolshevik attackers played to the fullest for their losses in battle.
The teacher Dmitry Pavlitsky, his unknown by the name of a relative, a young man Boris Alekseenko, was shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep washing pit, which was covered with earth."
According to the memoirs, "there was some kind of dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house.
The bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were always found on the streets
And maybe I'll really follow you. I need you. I can't without you.

I want me to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, right.
I am not afraid of work, since I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
Very interesting you have a tradition, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the sphere of economy was... the place where members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far it is not known about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The one that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then others may soar tomorrow ‚Äì for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, let us examine the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be possible to prevent it from moving members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect against the loss of the ability of the supervisory board to make decisions, but rather on the contrary will lead to it!
People's deputy, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned defense industry enterprises that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in UKROBORONPROM, which, in fact, manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in UKROBORONPROM, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocate a particular defense enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro also makes arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts, at the first word "war", leave Ukraine back in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
Firstly, it is a manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims against the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. There are 2 children with me.

We usually need a passport of one of the adults
In Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew for 2 days will be introduced.
Pavlyuk's quote: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, curfews have been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional state administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clean and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
No school has yet sent anything to me only have a receipt for payment

There is a word-for-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. I did it in another bank. Because you had to have an account to work with.
The Serbian defence budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyo Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Hennadii Kazakevych, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the forceful support of the SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained and one was wounded.
According to Viasna, during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with on-site medical care.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railways, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources "BZD" in VKontaktiye and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
To recap: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, the Russian Federation is transferring through Belarus in order to fight, in Ukraine manpower and equipment.

The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions on the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia's largest banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that are related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector exodus includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step in the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the latest part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the passage is closed and I will approach you
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp, my mother was a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because there was no longer strength to hide in the cellar.

We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.

Do you only have dad speaking and understanding Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do the cleaning of the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed that I distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he is scientifically conducting experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Natalia Nahorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social networks that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we are staying here
2 driving time )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here
A squadron ofüá®üáø Czech drones has started flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to the Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of the https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, the places of their deployment will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, they say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't care, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.

Well. If all goes well, I'll agree

The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady of the headman in the village in Yivov,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will be delighted and her mood will rise

Today it was cooler and rainy. Tomorrow should be warm.
But do not feel sorry for the destroyed houses, sorry for the people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, perhaps something else needed to be given

Since I am repelled from the days and time in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say approximately for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.

I would love to be your backup designer.
How will I be credited with the day that I was not at work there is a pass
Headquarters summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen from the specified brigade are recruited.
The enemy experiences a particular problem when manning the positions of drivers and drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmitrovka, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Zolote area, was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of some units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to have time, but I doubt
And how can you sleep and I support you
You definitely don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thanks. We didn't watch TV at home, much less 1+1. No need for us to customize :)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
Today I am running out of tariff package for a month :)
Can we do that today by phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
Then my father and I will meet, be sure üôèüèª to
I read the ad on Facebook ,then apparently Google wroteüèµÔ∏è something in its own way. , think the phone number is enough
Hello, we are the things that you brought you took, but there are things that are small on us that you can bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then from next week I can start going to work because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if it gets there, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech in order to know perfectly, I dream of working in Tva
Friends are old and not so much, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you, too.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is being subjected on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later," Sasha replied succinctly. ‚Äì Now, after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äì those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äì how many of you have done at least something to resist this regime?
Except perhaps to participate in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your enduring indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which have now probably placed a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you possessed freedom and democracy to some extent ‚Äì messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overwhelmed by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems to you that it is safer near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to lie on the bottom, update, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and dutifully came to terms with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me: "Delirium, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn good money, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is it a disaster?
Moscow shone festively and shone with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and terrified of what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia blatantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin swapped places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt terrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I hear it so far.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they seized the Maidan once and never left it.
They built a tent camp entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little use for it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly came from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, away as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 ‚Äì with their binbegs, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In truth, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers shooting my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came to the members of the trade unions, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äì like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians ‚Äì or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed ‚Äì he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went out to protests and still took place a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for anecdote were not in such a distant past ‚Äì and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more than in 2014 ‚Äì scares Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing on paper his superiority.
In view of everything, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on the lookout.
You understand what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hohma, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either to go somehow or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains another one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has already happened from time to time, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äì the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized can be created.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it gets to the point?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will experience understandable fear; Those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online ‚Äì and will be arrested; Your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a damp cell under police dubs.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only continue to intensify, acquiring more and more scales.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be at home
That you perceive me as a press secretary
Vico, how often do you go to dinner in an expensive restaurant?
Once a rtik I go to dinner in an expensive restaurant
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked the very beautiful one and we wanted something closer so this is the best option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I was tired energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, voice disappeared, weakness and head spinning
I have to go to that labor government
We have already done this,but said who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
On Thursday, a pass is required, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I was written by a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I expect new news from her and I will definitely inform her.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought that I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity for lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am a monogamist and I take marriage issues seriously.

Mr. Reichard, sorry I bother you after hours.

I walked into Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
Can this really be the case?
The working time of the room is until 16:00.
And in the end, it's our responsibility.
