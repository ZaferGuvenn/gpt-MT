The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that quite annoying, to be honest.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to a certain extent.
Just quickly look, just quickly help, just bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it is okay for him, that is good.
You can best judge for yourself whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is also the statement of the psychologist.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;) ---
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to mind anymore. Maybe someone here knows... ---
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses the fear center in the brain and ultimately forces them to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window, another intentionally drives herself to death.
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with fire.
That is the rough plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to anyone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference transferred back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside).
We tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and a sound capsule kit. ---
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register at a suitable digital central station.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® the CV values can be read on the main track with suitable central units.
For central units that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration at mfx®-compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, he also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automation allows for automatic pendulum movement between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railroads.
After my voucher was not extended in a friendly manner due to a complaint that did not reach me, I will cancel my order worth approximately.

What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron, Johnson will push for a booster vaccination.
New Omikron cases are always causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster in the Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly rising Omikron numbers than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent that we strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let yourselves be boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name. ---
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and don't want to step on any officials' toes.**
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one that I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had a defect that was not apparent at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only on the #PRS_ORG# tried.
But that has been working for about.
In 14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just have to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation behind closed doors, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never be easier because of that.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" worth?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an breathtaking presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim. ---
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
She did not lie down after the game, but rather increased her efforts in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
While more than the bare result, the way of the performance disappointed.
As an example, a statistic can be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions? ---
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we had trained for".
To move the ball, namely.
Sebastian Gleim, on the other hand, reacted very differently: "It's awesome to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the star performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came as close as eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind. ---
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to dwell on it.
The Giants will already receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 p.m.), then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already contacted a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. ---
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Always impeccably dressed: Max Raabe turns 59 ---
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other planned performances during the Advent season also have to be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January, the artists want to make up for the dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlager and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair combed back strictly and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music scene. ---
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, dear luck" since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover sheet but not flip through it.
Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With a expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Koalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be in stock again?
Or whether it will come again at all?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great.
Then I redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification! ---
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
This is an absolute cheekiness.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the USA caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to 100 fatalities.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of that, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that you are sold out of showcase #NAME#.
That is very sad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
When will you report back?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article via the contact form and wanted to inquire whether it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money premiums for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has changed to a company that he has criticized.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old spot either and looked for something else.
You may do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.

Help with first own campaign.
Boron greets you!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends through the adventure Over the Griffon Pass and would like to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumbling already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
The further action is supposed to develop there.
A group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes a few miles from the village and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, negotiating, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and swords.
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow road and flank the cart with three armed with bows on each side, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the receipts sent over, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or only the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has been deteriorating more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident had put the schedule far behind the planning, they could have still shown the last ten minutes as well as the championship decision. ---
Apparently, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite this, it is still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Despite this, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was again rule ignorance in F1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that this possibility exists for Verstappen.
I think that one should simply know such elementary rules if one comments on F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing game, what is now possible or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste. ---
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that makes both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. ---
The latter one in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, where you only have to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as free-TV broadcasters.
While one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising.
Thus, the fantastic F1 season is significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to know your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG#-pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlift.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or the like via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then it can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if once water would run backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course here no Corona stops.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services.
Of course, one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space. ---
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. ---
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule. ---
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the way for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their ticket each.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would most like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space flight by Blue Origin: In the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to color change, the light stone retains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light even looks particularly good - only with shortened luminous duration should be expected as soon as the days are shorter.
Please pay attention in the winter only to make sure that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary. ---
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery through our online shop and thus extend the use of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry has ---
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also researched job prospects before studying, but at the time I also thought that I definitely wanted to and would study until the doctorate.
Currently, doubts are coming to me, especially the job prospects are depressing me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one hears again and again about great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand one hears again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you do?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers! ---
I am currently really unsure and am considering possibly dropping out of college in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, please feel free to write them down :) ---
Extra stress before holiday and weekend holidays
This topic came up last week with me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day.
There was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of emails that absolutely had to be sent out before departure, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well because?
Because "next week then" sounds like a lot of time has passed and that can't be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also mighty annoyed.
What is this self-hostage situation because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the party by baking cookies with her son and doing some crafting.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather regrowth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed and balances it out.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR handiwork model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME magazine 11/1968, used with play wear and missing parts see photos, function good, the E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being restored to operational condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 about the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau railway repair workshop, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
As the need for locomotives for heavy goods train service increased with the progressive electrification of the central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred for construction.
Only when it became clear that the processing number could not be increased on the E 94, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives aged, the complicated control became problematic.
It often happened that the shooter got stuck during switching operations.
Then the stoker, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the shooter during the trip.
Damage to the driving motors occurred more often and led to months-long outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most sub-types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab. ---
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one to follow was the E 95 01, which resigned from service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time until the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external processing of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau. ---
She has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner at the DB Museum Halle (Saale). ---
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P tradition community have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with play marks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN. ---
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't set up the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle beam does not fit into the designated holder.
I also get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation according to the information.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
She will arrive much later then.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021. ---
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status so far.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend has motivated him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network. ---
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. ---
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," said Sahin at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power.
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several communities due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians could only temporarily put some of the lines back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to the company.
The power is back on.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m. on.
Since 23.15 hours, those affected by the power outage would also have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," explained District Chairman Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the undercarriage on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't slide it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further there?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it that way!
Can you send me the return slip by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insulting.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to admit defeat again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and use version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes up, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component.
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals or transfer stickers.
From national symbols on airplanes to ship names and decorative trim and badges on car models, decals give the model the final touch. ---
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
A plane cockpit can be more easily covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the moisture. ---
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand). ---
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check first whether the picture is properly seated before you completely slide it off the paper so that it does not stick, wrinkle or even tear on your finger.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log off and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I stopped reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Is that also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Despite that, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Child wish treatment in PKV / What is an "insurance case"? ---
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it suddenly becomes difficult.
In order:
We had applied for the children's wish treatment with the private health insurance in advance and received confirmation for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle these with the PKV.
We requested the cost coverage again from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
Okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward it to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to return the thing first.
I can't help it that the dresser arrives completely upset with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and obvious that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
A office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films.
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category? ---
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus comes at high cost for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs, however, are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained. ---
This state of suspension - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. ---
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
She apparently cannot assert herself if a member state decides to do its own thing, as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border ---
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokesperson for the agency said that 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border on Sunday night.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale. ---
Mercedes believes that Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I am checking that.
I am speaking with the bank and will get back to you later.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day.
The Europa-Park, namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sports Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were coupons for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains were glowing on this day through the red and white jerseys.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park has again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator. ---
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap Chinese goods.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all from our household.

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
This is like when an eagle says he has nothing against foreigners.
They will both not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just completely stop.
Yes wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the principle of evolution is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a god put the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science only talks nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and color errors even in the edge zone.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification specifications.
These statements only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses. ---
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal usage conditions are observed - the magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the Krembz community, women are selecting the Christmas trees. ---
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations during the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many strange situations.
That makes the pre-Christmas time always a little funny, he says.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly! ---
We don't need to have discussions here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, except for a few failures, received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which broadcasts the wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less it receives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely labor-intensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the checking account
Who would have thought that there would be peace with the checking accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks from their customers, the exemptions for negative interest rates are also continuing to decline.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the savings account.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower tax exemptions apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular among cost-conscious customers, has reduced the tax-free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now set a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Berlin District Court have even been granted right against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly create provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: only one chip from the bag).
That you still manage to win the hearts of both female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also make happy.
An unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen has to give up.
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight tire touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport elite.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsled - Sports
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
He first defended against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, driving from third place to first. ---
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously coming in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way too," Lochner said.
Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsled on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she stormed to victory in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi in the World Cup.
Two-man bobsled Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish of the winter in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear. ---
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and girls and women,
I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for some others...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child one to one. ---
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less (1-2x a week) which is very challenging for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having stomach pain right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now, housework is also coming our way, which we naturally divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well-controlled, I am halfway well-treated and coping.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test that I haven't done anything for yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has partly to do with the mental load of women and therefore I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has a print. ---
The first delivery was the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we swap the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 12/26/NUMBER.
In addition, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I realized back in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you stand on that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope the question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well too.
That's been very long, then I would refrain from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
In the movie there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live myself.
The transition is also the grave of the soldier, I believe.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can withstand much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around it is right, no stuffed animals, go in more often and look, but no minute surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and our had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it rise from the stomach?
Or is it face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common, for example, to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived two days ago (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not in use.
To put it very clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this channel are now below all pigs.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno said that they do not want to be a "running billboard".
What is one now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
These naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make a profit at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is one supposed to find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a callback because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - My little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner. ---
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad only for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual smells, mold or burn marks and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating before!

Darmstadt second after the first half - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well even under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore despite the plugged-in power supply.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need for everyday objects, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look. ---
The sleek, minimalist design has it proverbially in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds. ---
This works with two options: one is conventionally through the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked. ---
If the backpack is heavily loaded, you simply take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without engaging the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily store both separated from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
In this way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not interfere.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.

The shipping company has announced contact for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any news.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It is then foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and have not been able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on balancing the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that increasingly works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away. ---
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
To us parents and other responsible adults, it must never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as is sensible and possible in the situation.
I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the testing requirement for those who have received three doses of the vaccine.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have received three doses of the vaccine is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference already on Tuesday next week".
I also want to return the lamp.
How do I proceed best there?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer handle any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer goes.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
It most commonly leads to hearing noises/voices, less commonly to seeing images, and very rarely to perceiving pain.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me correctly describes awareness, but u/Nitemarex by definition did not have any.
I read her comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ also won't help us. ---
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in the eCommerce sector in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money there.
I already sent you an email that you did not answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
why haven't I been called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the printer: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify my life thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are used primarily as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.

Rolled roast tips and tricks ---
I got many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I have gotten a taste for it and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
How does it continue now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can handle it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 01/18 that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not come to me.
Please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you not yet gotten poultry?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds. ---
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and distortion. ---
Earlier, it was mentioned that the POWER LEVEL control can even make a power reserve when it gets really loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The attached signal is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally treat yourself to a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects. ---
For live deployment, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step into the future! ---
I had seen that with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it because it hangs too low over the dining table?
I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me further with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included in the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that are to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement had been resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also in Vienna on site, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state that has had a corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euros for return shipping is a cheekiness in my eyes.
It is time for change.

If you look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, you can conclude that it is non-existent.
We have entered a winter torpor and have extended the summer lull for several months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, this is likely simply related to dissatisfaction with how things have been handled here and how we generally stand. ---
In recent days, the impression has increasingly been shown that many people here still really want the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess. ---
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project also have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work on specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten some things, but that's not a problem, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the #PRS_ORG# bedspread, is it also available in plus size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to take action now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian for a while, currently eats meat very rarely.
I was also a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought. ---
And namely, that I long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that resentment arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering was reduced.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without intending to.
A harmonious vegan greets (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be there in person due to a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me please.
As of February 1st, I will be available again.
The Lahnstein dam is equipped for water rescue: a 45,000 euro grant from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle water rescue of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Mayor Peter Labonte of Lahnstein. ---
The device car is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanently increasing deployments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations, but I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, but NOTHING worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, then it is like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process? ---
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the aforementioned values in the Fenix laboratory are measured at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery. ---
The values may vary depending on the flashlight used, age, and environment.
The burning time in the bright stage includes the burning time with reduced brightness due to overheating protection.

Thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar position, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, but I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Generally, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that of course, people in special uniforms and carrying weapons can also attract conservatives from the right, but it is also clear that these people can then have difficulty dealing with reality. Of course, it is also clear that besides the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine stereotype gay, because there are rather fewer of these in the executive, but rather normal men and
But even these marginalized groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less included by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly fights for them or tries to do them right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
However, such things are well fought in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order that is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that were filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but throughout my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it is actually never the case that someone could come over spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses against work and lack of interest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with the child?
We don't have one yet but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and for example there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Is there a greater incentive with children or do you remain sloppy?
I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing at the joints for improved movement freedom (at arm and knee bends)
The Focea Comfort 4 was more than doubled in the Flex System 2, covered by the Flex System, to further increase comfort.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of software development and have been a qualified professional for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a while now about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the specific workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("again, the simplest things messed up") and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it by now"/"I'm holding him back from work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really under-qualified" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you already receive the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by return please !
If I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, the message appears that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein it has taken in with its food in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and then builds its own protein substances from these, which it also needs for feather formation. ---
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the regrowth of feathers in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed. ---

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
A motion for dismissal has also been filed with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the bylaws. ---
But in the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg.
According to the police press alarm (14:03), a car has come into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injuries.
I see, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again that it went so easily!
Rats and ideas for further professional life.
First of all, happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up in teaching and was sure that this is it - even though the conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can always switch.
But I am absolutely finished right now.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my time off was my time off.
I had free time then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the ref is doing well, as far as feedback and such is concerned.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter as is now the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't be back in the same place as I am now and unhappy.
You notice that everything is somehow confused, but maybe you have advice or ideas as outsiders on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely finished with and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your opinions will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that would be enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope that my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has consistently evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier. ---
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. ---
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. ---
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble. ---
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001. ---
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here. ---
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response. ---
During a thorough analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. ---
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to your photo equipment needs and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras. ---
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Furthermore, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not make any predictions about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions ---
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava, which is over 1000 degrees Celsius, has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed from cooled lava with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it, was particularly hard hit. It was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child ---
Technically, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in some way on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin. ---
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular German tradition of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants rejected this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys a few that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin parades. ---
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a happy confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, was assigned some characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to houses. ---
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts. ---

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
A man armed with a weapon was shot by the police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace. ---
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground stakes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum luminous duration 10 hours.
- The robust plastic design is suitable for use outdoors throughout the year. ---
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
Completely harmless, on the other hand, is "Smart Stone": the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "glow stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two supplied ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; you can choose the color yourself: six attractive light colors are available to you, in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
I have done this several times, it does not work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway.....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.

Pill problem
Hello dear womenfolk, ---
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on reddit after a year.
As for my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and crap PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne all over my body during my last two-year break.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me very seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then widespread nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have also tried everything possible in terms of nutrition in the context of a Christian illness and have stayed with a low sugar, low milk and low meat mixed diet because nothing else has really worked well. ---
It may also be the case that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have construction sites everywhere like I do, you would rather not go looking for what else might be wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague seminar or something.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large quantities?

The 110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk announced this now.
The approximately seven kilometer long earth cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues, ---
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I currently still have big problems with efficiently planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
We are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
I usually start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) when planning and then think about how to build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed in most stores.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales declines.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Trade Association (HDE).
At stores with non-daily necessities, sales declines are to be lamented, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth. ---
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require high personnel deployment.
He demanded that the band regulation be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as they already are in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now surely fall during the important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche". ---
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops without interference". dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filling material.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory. ---
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively close distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To adjust the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and tough use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
Thus, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received that as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had previously lost two games in a row, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it on, scored within an hour to relieve the frustration of a mediocre season start and won 5-2. "It's amazing what the guys did today," coach Oliver Glasner celebrated on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise" to everyone who was involved. ---
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still ranked ninth and not meeting expectations. ---
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0.
What happened next impressed even the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is already on Wednesday as part of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky) on the program.
What grade do I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and redirecting it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Blow for women's handball team ahead of quarter-final against Spain.
Germany's handball women crept off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danish women (10:0).
It is a shame that we could not take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from everyone, we have to delete it," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look forward quickly."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counter-attack.
The hoped-for spark was not this.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly set themselves in scene - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent shortly afterwards. ---
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a bit better and at least get to within five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener-Schützlinge sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster up an improvement in performance and left the court as clear losers.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season.

The title indicates that I am a vaccination doctor working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is primarily administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished to a large extent, it will continue partly in vaccination centers for me afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to me personally (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does it interact with the vaccination..").
My job responsibilities include educating people about vaccination, determining eligibility for vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination regulations, documenting medical information, and providing emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). ---
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often do not have doctors, but "only" (God forbid, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, submitted by an Amberger, has caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "We in Bavaria".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time. ---
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also no one, "who needs everything to go quickly".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution and probably also caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate people.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, a gap in education was closed - probably also among many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tyre choice for racing bikes- really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour next week.
I said, done, and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happens in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurked.
Glass shards on the track. ---
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue for the rest of the journey at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home. ---
It was not so bad in terms of mood swings, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike ride. ---
Now I am facing a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would extremely dislike getting this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike he had ridden 120km until 2pm!) and he had also described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years on a roller.
But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90 km while driving, I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ / tire now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the racing bike at the moment.
They are also available (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The Swallow page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then ended up on the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminds of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a properly designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume is not a priority, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of that magnitude.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressively accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in high tones.
This is common with broadband to optimize the strong bundling of high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a dynamics that is unmatched.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our building kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housing, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate location in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of oneself.
Now the back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are glued on. ---
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, including the two sides and the front.
The use of a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill bit facilitates the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection clamp on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round mill is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal follows.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), one begins with the laying of the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In this case, the entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until the terminal opening and left there about 30 cm protruding.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loose there. ---
Next, the crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency divider, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Solo 15 crossover assembly instructions.
Once the crossover is installed and the terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows. ---
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the suppression according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
But: At least three people will be on the switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30. ---
Put drinks in the fridge, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
