Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent this from happening again.

At the Zhejiang University academic conference, the student sang the main role and the research results were mind-blowing.
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by sniffing, and accurately searching for the source of haze, a series of academic achievements with great imagination were awarded at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 academic year conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. From a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensors: your home medical examination doctor
The doctoral student team of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Zhang Diming, demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You just need to take a gentle breath, and this instrument can detect the body's health condition from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
The smart bracelet that can detect health conditions on the market generally detects physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
Many diseases are related to the lamp used in the doctor's operating room because early detection and removal are not in place.
Shen Junfei said that for example, when cancer is detected early, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light discs, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and other classmates invented a set of "air washing hand device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
"In this way, we can wash our hands clean!"
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleanliness, but also save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that feels very meaningful - first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken in case of sudden events, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, people around us know how important it is to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing. The feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
In China, we have three million accidental deaths per year according to official data, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average is 15% that can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 80% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, there is no breathing, no heartbeat, and pinching the person's carotid artery is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save the person.
I found that few people now have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
Maybe it can even save a person's life!
First aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The 13 yuan shrimp dumpling is only one!?
I haven't tried it.
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?

Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# delivered only one shrimp dumpling to me! ?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a complete failure in every aspect, in every sense.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight, it's not bad at least the music is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching it, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a clique novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a pile of shit.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part of the country, and he should rely on his grandmother for his livelihood.
Her grandmother has a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranges for a neighbor's uncle to take her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
The elderly person sitting in a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are still very reassured about this.
Then the old man disappeared. 然后这位老人就没下文了。 Then the old man disappeared. 然后这位老人就没下文了。 Then the old man disappeared. 然后这位老人就没下文了
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on a discarded ship?
Why can the island's flying car gangsters easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck drivers around could not be found.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and suspected of illegal activities become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't you call the police when faced with high-interest loans? The police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room card to open the door, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner, sleeps outside the room for a night?
This inexplicable plot is filled throughout the film, and because the plot is so absurd that I will feel pain when I remember them.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the movie's theme, or rather, the movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a repulsive patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think he wants to make a comedy, 20 minutes later you guess it may be a motivational film, half way through you think it may be a drama that reflects the difficulties of young people in small towns, after watching you don't even know what you watched, followed by deep doubt about yourself, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the crap during the big New Year.
For most people, it is actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is step by step to success.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot have things that are contrary to the normal world.
For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng, which was just burned, and the character who can still sing, cannot go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy cannot bear.
As for the female protagonist, who is obviously not mentally challenged but behaves like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies.
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to add congestion to the audience?

For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, wing walls of bridges, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have a concave and convex groove structure on all four sides, which is combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the well wall is far superior to that of the masonry form of the flat friction masonry. ---
The module is a hollow structure, and after combination, the longitudinal holes are interconnected and the transverse holes are penetrated. After the core casting, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The module is equipped with reinforcement grooves in both directions, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcement increases the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking, leakage, etc., and the mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output device, one-key touch-type LCD display monitoring the entire mechanical operation process, realizing ideal human-computer dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio and density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall wall module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single cylinder hydraulic, conveying, double cylinder hydraulic, conveying.
An independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box progresses in the mold box, the material storage box door closes, the automatic conveyor tray, all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, sealing parts, hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table surface line cutting and molding without welding points, so that the filling box can freely swing and guide, and fully reduce mechanical wear and tear.
Reduce the load on the mold, fill the material and compact the amplitude in one step, adopt integration, full synchronization, table vibration and mold vibration, to ensure the vibration solidification effect.
The mechanical vibration machine and computer-controlled amplitude adjustment of the well wall module mechanical equipment are adjusted according to the cost-performance ratio of the raw materials, without wear and tear braking, thus prolonging the service life and reducing costs.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship system, admission is equivalent to corporate probationary employees - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools, and students who are accepted for pilot training will also have the identity of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises. § Code #@title # 昨天，记者从市教委获
The city education commission requires that vocational schools standardize their enrollment and employment procedures for enterprises, clarify the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and potential employees of enterprises, and sign three-party agreements according to the principle of two-way selection between apprentices, schools, and enterprises. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and job transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training system as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. On-the-job training generally lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 modern apprenticeship pilot programs for secondary vocational schools in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot program, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of piloting first and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students' job skills, and increasing the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Although Omikron is highly contagious, it is mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant Omikron are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the spread of the Omikron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Hauden reported that the symptoms of the new crown patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough similar to flu symptoms.
The director of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become severely ill from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta epidemic, the novel coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks have severe symptoms, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent coronavirus patients, only 3% have died, compared to 20% in the early cases in South Africa.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports saying: "Currently, almost all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to get later data."
In general, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic two weeks ago.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the main strain of the new coronavirus in the world, cases of Omikron are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Hauden province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%. ---

Education commentary: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public welfare advertisement slogan "no trade, no murder" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "trafficking", group prevention and control, and national anti-trafficking, make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the child abduction information emergency release platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an authoritative channel for the establishment of missing children's information and the timely recovery of abducted children. It is an internet information platform created for this purpose.
I heard that the app is called "Tuan Yuan" and it feels very warm.
The new technology means not only has a name "artistic" and full of feelings, but also is properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement in the case of child abduction is to find the abducted child and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be enumerated with many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the trafficking case is exposed, the personal safety of the victims should be the top priority.
The importance of the matter should be weighed and the urgency should be considered. Under the urgent goal of "rescue", topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished with the death penalty" can be put aside for careful discussion. However, the rescue of abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
A delay of one minute in the search and rescue operation may cause the child to move further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will also increase by one point.
In this situation, taking out effective methods such as the "reunion" platform that directly helps to solve cases and find children is indeed a practical action.
After all, "fighting against human trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the "protection of the weak and the weak" care.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from families to society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the train station, the parents are asleep, and they wake up to find that the child is missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable level of protection awareness.
The minimum measures to prevent children from being abducted are for parents to take turns resting or to place the child under safe protection.
From the perspective of the police cracking down on human trafficking crimes, the buyers of kidnapped children should also be focused on and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory punishment for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
The starting point for punishment is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. In the trend of "lenient punishment", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a more serious crime.
There are still many cases of human trafficking happening every year.
It can be seen that some people's ideas on parenting are outdated and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized and followed up.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for human trafficking is widespread, traffickers will be driven by greed and constantly innovate their methods, leading to a "struggle" with law enforcement. Anti-trafficking efforts will inevitably become bogged down in inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.

Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than shown.
There is no more, thank you.
Yes, I have already changed the rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
I waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil (also known as lampante olive oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olive fruits and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure taste and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or known as "secondary oil".
refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil: a blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is obtained by dissolving and refining the oil residue from the olive pomace.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes for making wine, coming from different regions and different olive varieties, they will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olive growth is:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions, including temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation, for the growth of olive trees. ---
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be grown in scattered areas of suitable habitat.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates also have Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. far south of the latitude.
The month of olive picking:
From March to June every year, it is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit picking season is from November to February of the following year (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants. --- 橄榄油富含丰富的单不饱和脂肪酸，即油酸及亚油
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit has come to an end, with Biden declaring that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" hosted by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society leaders from 110 countries as well as private sector leaders concluded on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democratic Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative, political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun-tsung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
"An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the spark of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective efforts of society as a whole.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be able to withstand the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, and combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong recorded a video speech for the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans in China.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and leaders of civil society must cooperate.
We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat of the (Communist Party) to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason why we must change."
Taiwan's Executive Yuan's Administrative Affairs Committee member Tang Feng attended a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values" and released a "National Statement" through video, emphasizing Taiwan's position on the front line against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is on the rise, we have always stood firmly on the front line of global resistance to authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world justified their infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we do not need to take down fake information to win.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, which were deemed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, an investment restriction was imposed on a Chinese company that was found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time keeps getting delayed.
It turns out that it was #NUMBER#.
I won't call anymore.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain.
You can't deliver it, why didn't you tell me earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please inform him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
A meal waited for half an hour.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is alive.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of "entry-level shot" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and vibrates a lot, the hard ball can't withstand it, and it's difficult for experts to handle.
The logic and underlying assumptions behind their existence are - tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they make cheap ones to fool you, you play twice and you won't play again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel sorry.
When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy expensive things when that time comes, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar price to buy a second-hand racket that is a little better, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not sold at high prices, new rackets are 500 or 600, second-hand 200, is it not fragrant to have the enjoyment of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
Can you help me follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I need to ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivered food, and the salivating chicken was also raw.

The order I placed is for delivery, there is no such thing as self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly plump bodies in terms of clothing matching.
The girl with a fat body should not wear a skirt that is too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three parts, upper, middle, and lower, it will naturally make you look taller. For example, using different colors for your upper body, skirt, and long socks will create a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your fat body, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeable.
The more popular, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, giving people a feeling of obesity.
For slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of good clothing matching.
Plump girls should never wear tight short skirts, and the tops should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind of fine grid), choose a soft texture of printed trumpet skirts, with a drape collar shirt, can cover up the shortcomings of plump girls very well.
Of course, a slightly plump girl also has to be careful when wearing a short skirt.
The fat girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous short dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your strengths.
A-line skirts will be very slimming, more suitable for fat girls, tops should choose tighter, forming a sense of hierarchy will be thinner.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even a fat MM can try it.
A slightly plump girl can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, then even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, we should also exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of slightly fat girl earlier 😄

The girl who was used as a target for her sister's fundraising said, "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound." - Xinhua News Agency
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'arrow target' for her sister to raise funds" went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a slightly higher wooden board, which reads "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow", indicating that pedestrians can use bows and arrows after payment.
The behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xicheng Branch confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such a radical move for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for soliciting donations on the street with a "bullseye"
The circulated picture shows a long-haired girl standing in the shape of "个" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written in black ink with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow", and another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc. § Code #@title # 网传图片中，一位
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens express sympathy for this.
We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers.
The police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station said in an interview with local media that there were two girls, both around 20 years old, dressed beautifully and youthfully. ---
One of the girls, who was acting as a "human target," was crying and asking passersby to play the game. Another girl was standing on the side, shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery. She asked everyone to help.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xicheng Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising funds for her sister Jijiayan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in costs, we couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so we had to resort to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were used as targets, one was responsible for shooting, but did not participate, and no one was found to shoot arrows during the whole process, only someone watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police, the security department identified that the bow and arrow used did not belong to the control category.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this kind of eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.

This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with enough workmanship and materials, and a reassuring brand!

The red on the butt is a very nice color of wine, not so tacky, and the overall value is much higher than expected. It's worth buying, and it's also suitable for girls.
I started using Acer Aspire Night Knight two years ago, and after two years, it has a high cost-performance ratio and good quality.
I also recommend this product to my friends around me!
I have already bought three machines in this series!
The appearance is beautiful and good-looking, and the configuration is also very good.
I bought it for my nephew, and I wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the big bank activity, which is a little regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back to review after using it for a while.

The one I bought for my son, he said it was very good.
The computer is very good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, do not understand the question is good, recommended to buy.
It's not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest thing in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was an article called "Quick Look! Project managers can impact the Olympic project for gold medals" that was very popular. It mentioned that project managers are absolutely first-class in many projects and no one can match them: carrying bricks, traveling, and staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, and firefighting, carrying the pot, and apologizing are not to be mentioned.
An article that seems to be a joke and a joke, but also points out the daily bitterness of project managers, behind which is the lack of effort in current project management work.
And those engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related difficulties.
From the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) registration applicants increasing each year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management abilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, with a valid certificate number of about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® certificate.
The number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the old "experience" and do things. The changing work environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does taking the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to land in work, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, project dragging; Member division of labor is not clear, "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the

Jiexin advocates rational consumption for consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival national network payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, compared to previous years to create a new high.
The various discount coupons and eye-catching live broadcast sales have once again benefited consumers, and this consumption trend has made people feel that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger. On the other hand, we must calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, the performance of residents in China in terms of financial consumption is good, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and further improvement in basic financial knowledge is needed.
The financial literacy of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China's Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to regulatory calls, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the years, CITIC has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovation practice competitions and other forms of subliminal guidance on the rational consumption needs of young groups, help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer credit mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan ahead when consuming and repay on time according to their ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future car purchases, housing purchases, and other economic activities.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer-trusted consumer finance partner for life.

The Vietnam People's Daily Online - The Gulf Cooperation Council should respond to common challenges.
The stopovers of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis in mid-2017, when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The tense diplomatic situation has seriously affected the internal unity of the ASEAN, and has had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in the country.
The resolution of differences by the Gulf Arab states to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the need to unite for the interests of the countries and regional stability, and is aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of the supply chain.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers on saving the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long considered Iran a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region without resolving the Iranian missile issue.
In the context of the major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran have engaged in direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the slowing of the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economic growth.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the Gulf Union and to propose measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

It is said to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in XinShan District!
This time our team has brought this car for everyone, which is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the road tax for a year is several thousand ringgit, and it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is because it has 700 horsepower?
Well, the editor doesn't know either, but the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100 km/h. That's probably when the editor's myvi reaches 30 km/h, others have already reached 100 km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say much about the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Being too much in the spotlight, wherever you go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
1km of fuel costs around RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the train, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deaf after getting off. (But it's still cool)
The body of the car is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space. I'm afraid of being knocked by the door of the next car when it opens!
It's a little lonely because there are no opponents on the road. (This is what the editor said, not the car owner, ha ha)
Please do not misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, please contact us!
More car information you don't know, is in The Car Guide / People's Car Journal.
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be known by car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, foreign countries crashed millions of 911 sports cars and millions of Chiron supercars in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it is reasonable that you are expensive!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua News Agency.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated over time in the development process of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered unique missions different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating virtue and benefiting the world, repairing and governing peace" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, global education competition, technological competition, and talent competition are intensifying, and higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially the proposal of "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" shows not only the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher education power to a higher education strong country, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to quickly build several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and strive to enter the ranks of the world's top in a shorter time, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; second, cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate
It is particularly important to realize that it is impossible for a world-class university to be the same in a thousand schools. Each school must highlight its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of education should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, educational tradition and resource endowment of each individual.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment of science, technology, and education, and forming a complete entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary subjects, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary subjects and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we highlight the characteristics of
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Virtue, Clarity, and Practicality", and the common expression system of "Including rivers and oceans, opening up true and thick virtues, opening up the people before things, and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and shows the quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, the university should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of character; "Kai Wu Qian Min" embodies the spirit of reform
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silence, the enlightened see the formless."
China's universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of China's socialist cause, deeply grasp the historical mission and the position of higher education in the era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing endless motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

The maximum number of years that Guangxi University students can take a leave of absence for entrepreneurship is five years - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th, Special Report (Reporter Zhang Ying) - Reporters recently learned from the Education Bureau of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that in the future, Guangxi's universities will implement a flexible education system, relax the limit on university students' leave of absence, and extend the leave of absence for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original education system. The time for leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be considered as
To promote the ability of college students to start businesses and innovate, the departments of education and human resources in Guangxi have jointly built an entrepreneurship platform and constructed more off-campus practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external protection for college students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases of each university should be more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch majors.
College teachers must be attached to industry enterprises for at least two months every two years in order to improve their awareness and ability in innovative and entrepreneurial education.
The Autonomous Region Education Bureau requires that all universities in Guangxi implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training program in depth, striving to make every college student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years.
Colleges and universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.
The University of Australia has awarded honorary doctorates to seven outstanding individuals.

Ouyang Yu first congratulated the seven outstanding individuals who received the honorary doctorate degree, expressing warm congratulations and high respect. They have achieved extraordinary achievements in different fields and made outstanding contributions to the development of the country and the progress of the world. At the same time, Ouyang Yu expressed the most sincere blessings to the graduates and parents, and also expressed heartfelt respect to the dedicated and academically excellent faculty team of the university.
At a lecture at the University of Sydney's School of Humanities, Professor Sun Yifeng read Professor Liu Zunyi's praise and said that Professor Liu Zunyi is a renowned economist worldwide, known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-thinking educational philosophy.
In addition to his achievements in economic development, economic growth and the East Asian economy, he is also a visionary educational leader.
In short, he has made outstanding contributions in many fields.
Sun Yifeng read the praise of Professor Nakamura Shūji when he said that Professor Nakamura Shūji is a pioneer in sustainable energy technology.
He became one of the three winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the blue light-emitting diode (LED).
Professor Nakamura's invention not only completely changed the lighting industry, but also led to the widespread application of white light-emitting diodes in daily life and industrial production, making a huge contribution to human welfare.

As NFTs quickly become mainstream, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
《Axie Infinity》 is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplay including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, with a total of over $3 billion as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds $8.2 million, approaching "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
《Axie Infinity》 is spreading a new "play-to-earn" model to more people through the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer just single characters, and in addition to enjoying the game and economic benefits, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This kind of subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion yuan; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry's growth in the future 3-5 years to reach the best state; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics is about "doing things right," which means doing things correctly.
Strategy lies in "doing the right thing," which means doing the correct thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and above most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or to expand horizontally in the field (strategic thinking); for example, in addition to thinking about how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to improve the participation
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has experienced several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador will designate Bitcoin as its legal currency, marking the first time Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market, expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

The most important thing about shooting a wedding photo is that the photographer and makeup artist are both aesthetically online, fortunately I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also a "photo cheat".
Asian-American groups have filed complaints against Yale and other three Ivy League schools for discriminatory admissions practices.
More than 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - discriminate against Asian American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at a press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria for American universities has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities have "systematically and consistently discriminated against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions process".
Zhao Yu-kong introduced that in 2014, Sanders and other scholars' research showed that among these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented actual racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation after submitting an appeal and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions.
They also expect that the colleges and universities that are being complained about will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian Americans.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group participating in the appeal, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after negotiating the details of the factory building purchase with the family of the property owner, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through a bank transfer on the same day. ---
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Deposit Receipt" and it was stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and both parties agree to sign the factory building sales contract within one week."
However, the two sides later failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the real estate sales contract.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house that Mr. Lu finally found and liked, he paid the deposit and prepared the payment, but the seller did not sell it at the last moment, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu will sue Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
The court found that the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it was not solely the fault of the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, so the case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. The defendant is not liable for the breach of the double return of the deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind that necessary diligence and attention should be exercised in the course of the transaction.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and other relevant information, and clearly specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States' holding of the "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing a line with ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, pretending to be democratic in name but acting against democracy in reality, inciting division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, promoting 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposing unilateral sanctions, and instigating 'color revolutions', resulting in disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale, lethal weapon' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but not China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian and totalitarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden government is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing this summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Schulz, also participated in the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, and wealth differentiation, etc. The American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital basis.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be able to withstand the forces of authoritarian buffering and impact, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest. "
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it among each generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face continuous and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The US side has promised to launch a year-long action after this democratic summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democracy summit to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

The taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
Ri Chang Laodian has been a popular online presence for many years, with its small building and wooden flooring in Dongdan.
The porridge rice at the entrance always takes a long time to eat, and the pot of porridge rice has cracked...
It has been several years since I last ate at Richeng. The rise of various small shops has dispersed the flow of customers.

What is the drinking method for Red Label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine. Red Label whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and Red Label whisky has won a gold medal at the International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it's a waste of its mellow flavor.
So how do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor gives a brief introduction for everyone.
Red card whisky drinking method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is made from about 35 kinds of Scottish whisky, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The rich aroma has a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whisky enters the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky + Coke or Sprite or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks become a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can visually bring pleasure to people, adding to the drink, diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the taste. ---
Red whisky + sliced lemon + square sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. You can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Education thinking: how to make college exams benefit both "academic elites" and "academic underachievers" - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to improve the difficulty of the exams, change the exam format, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level of proficiency.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, and the situation of learning varies greatly.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when it comes to assessment.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by focusing on last-minute cramming. If they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "academic underachievers" can pass the exam without much effort and even get high scores; "academic overachievers" who never miss class, have good homework and notes, and don't score much higher on exams, are in a "strange situation".
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without reason in reflecting on the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give thumbs up to the three students who wrote the letters directly.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon for them to rush to prepare for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive to define the scope of the exam, and seek "key guidance" before the exam. Even in the exam, the situation of carrying a small copy and asking the teacher to raise his hand after the exam is not surprising.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, measuring whether a university examination is qualified or not is more about teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be divided into smaller parts, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is the content that college exams need to test.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and common sense of the disciplines, and from the perspective of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of studying mathematics in college 20 years ago is still the focus of study today."
But the basic knowledge points do not change, it does not mean that the examination questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of a question-making group, and then the papers are coordinated by senior subject teachers. The examination and marking are also participated by all teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
But to draft a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions are based on the overall situation of the students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of questions, both highlighting the examination of basic knowledge and taking into account the ability examination, and innovating the design of
Examinations are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of examination, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attach great importance to the suggestion letter from the students and have deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out research and course-ending exams for self-examination, formulate exam papers and related systems, and strengthen supervision and inspection of the exam paper-making and review process, refine the grading of results, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort is in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching situations, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. By understanding both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more

3200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper.
Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeit paper stock, the issuance of birth certificates to newborns has been impossible since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kalu aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeiting paper will be issued when it arrives next week.
He explained at the press conference about a report on the issue of Sabah newspaper printing on recycled paper that has been reported for up to 10 months by a web media.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in arriving in our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by Sabah newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kailu Amunis revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20th) to hand over to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 20,801 birth certificates so far this year.
I have been waiting since more than 7 o'clock.
Is it almost here?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Good, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism requires strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and a "buffer zone".
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic at port cities, requiring that people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must have a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city range in each province, region and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
Implementing differentiated management policies in different regions, changing from one line of defense against external spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the advance of the gate, compress the risk of external spillover of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas epidemics.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate timely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items at all links, unstandardized management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and precise emergency disposal of the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly fill the gaps and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that cities at all ports should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, and publish and facilitate the hotlines for the protection of people's livelihood. Regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly-administered cities, and the specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, directly-administered cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video exposes the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty massacre-Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on YouTube called "Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States' "anti-terrorism" war in Afghanistan, forcibly exporting American democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of bloody warfare.
Misuse of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature, and establishing a killing group.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black jail" to apply various tortures and personal humiliations to "suspects".
Each inhumane crime further incites the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "gets more and more terrifying."
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's expose the truth of the United States' bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article by accident, which discusses from a commercial and preservation perspective why this customer wants to use a bonded logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of bonded logistics companies. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many milk powder factories and have been in contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone must be wondering: why is the shelf life of bagged food a year, while the shelf life of canned food is two years or longer?
Or ask again: why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
Actually, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat with this mentality and then say that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aid, where is it expensive?
Why is the price difference so great when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them consider that if the bagged pricing is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a significant increase in the pricing of the listening device to protect their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers focus on hearing aids, rather than bag packaging.
And you think so many manufacturers' annual advertising costs are tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
So with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as mall promotion personnel, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and are listening to them, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, use any means necessary to hook up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, earning profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operations, in fact, this approach is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that everyone buy bagged milk powder and put it in a can at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it is only that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold, it was dry and hard, and it was completely impossible to eat.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the things he sent from #PRS_ORG# must have cooled down.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When strolling through the book market, one often feels the popularity of self-help books.
Many of the success books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it immediately bypasses the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it".
That's why these books all have one thing in common - either they give it their all and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes anyone who sees it recognize it as "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make a firm decision, start over, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conservative and refuse to change, it is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you need to change" in their ears.
Most people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", hesitant, and unable to make a determination; or they make a determination to "transform" based on a momentary impulse and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they cannot persist for a while, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "From Tomorrow On" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that could enable more ordinary people to embark on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a "theory of small victories" that if you can't do 100, only 1 is fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, only climbing the small sand dune at your doorstep is fine, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist, the probability of success will also increase.
The success path that follows the "second-best principle" is only slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" is on the surface with the flag of making everyone successful, it can actually motivate only a few people in the end; the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year-Xinhua News Agency
The latest monitoring results show that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection in 2002, according to the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as human hunting and the degradation of the breeding water environment. In 2002, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as a endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial reproduction and release, as well as cleaning up the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserve continues to increase year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in the lake.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area ban notices for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system for "one river, one river, and one lake".

I just saw an article about menstrual leave, it's too long.
For those who don't know, here is a brief science lesson for men.
Most girls will experience their first menstrual period between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Under the premise of good health, I will come regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be accurately predicted. It is about a week's tolerance. It is necessary to prepare in advance. Sometimes, bad luck can also cause a crash (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have little bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain that they need an ambulance. Dysmenorrhea changes over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt in the future.
During the few days when menstruation cannot be controlled, 24 hours of bleeding from start to finish, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton swabs to absorb blood to prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve monthly pain. It is useless to take it after the menstrual cramps start.
Before the menstrual period, due to excessive uterine congestion and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's about time for the period, stomachache for no reason, basically menstruation will come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise bacteria will easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the prepared copies, there may be 50 pieces, not every month. One piece is used.
You don't need to change the sanitary cotton swabs often, about every five or six hours, at most eight hours.
Hormonal changes during menstruation and ovulation may make you more irritable and moody, and your body can be a hindrance to yourself.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
Not only blood flows, but also the shed endometrium.
The endometrium is thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrial thickening) every month to prepare for guests, but if the guests do not come, it will be demolished (menstruation) and a new house will be built next month, repeating this cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades, a few days 24 hours of bleeding every month, and abdominal pain, who would like it?
But people can be born because their mother has had menstrual periods, which are to prepare the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy menstrual periods.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to think that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, thinks that the preparation of the female body for the birth of life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, do not think so, never experienced, this life will not experience, also do not understand the men, do not be so ungrateful, how can this attitude face their own mother, how can you think of your own child?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Please order a separate meal for the children.
I hope that the store will check the products even in the midst of busyness.
Is the foot bath basin numb because of a power leak?
Choosing the right foot bathtub can have a good foot care and health care effect. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's awareness of health care increases, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. Foot baths are available in a wide range, giving consumers a great choice of space.
On the relevant data table, compared with traditional household appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are hot in sales, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was withdrawn, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the long-standing foot bath basin has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material guarantees of harmlessness.
But in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that a few products were not strictly checked when they left the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath when purchasing.
The separation of water and electricity poses no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
The Vice Chairman of the China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Council, Hou Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum into "Five-Color Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a 100 billion yuan tea industry, and forming a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Water, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to exert their strength, and the main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wind and water turn in turn, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea industry experts in the province say that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan red".
At the Xinghua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhungao, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea expo on the scene, there are many highlights.
Xinhua red tea is a splash of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, popular and hot in trade, and the Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "metaphysics" comes from the "Yijing • Xici Shangzhuan" "The shape and the above is called the way, the shape and the below is called the instrument" one sentence, for the Japanese person Inoue Tetsujiro (Meiji era) translated from metaphysics.
Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that includes ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only concepts.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.

It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should follow) , applied ethics (the academic discipline that applies ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing from observed patterns).
It does not start from the expected theory for the examination of ethics, but rather investigates the actual moral agents' real choices that are made and observed, and all the moral factors that lead to these choices. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by people such as Vala and Montaigne.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted to this day.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the deceased's parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families and jobs.
It is your noble deeds that have helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is raging globally, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop giving humanitarian donations to our difficult group - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have been completed long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the IFCSS and the MCDF's 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the American Federation of Students and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often intersect.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the 64 victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, the MCDF subsequently established the "June 4th Poor and Elderly Special Difficult Household Relief Fund" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations from campuses and society on June 4th, from generous individual donations, and is supported by the Democracy Foundation of brother universities. ---
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the families of the victims of the June 4th incident finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong under the name of June 4th.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a stop to the June 4th donations, considering the donors. We are indeed some retired old people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our thanks to Mr. Ding's "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the difficult family members and terminate the project within two years, and resume immediately if necessary.
For those who have been generous and selfless for many years, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our gratitude and respect.

Member evaluation
[Effect] Photo effect: took two sets of clothes overall not bad relatively like this set of pictures ~
Service details: Because I was pregnant and felt a little uncomfortable during makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's comment. Originally, I said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can charge us up and keep us moving forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend all the little friends to come!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no room for criticism.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and can match the makeup suitable for your style according to your style. The makeup products used are also first-line big brands.
Teacher Liang doesn't need to be mentioned, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing together.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing require half a year of queueing in advance. Some of my colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and after watching the finished film, I feel it's just so-so.
I specifically looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is also the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
A makeup artist, photographer, and post-production designer, a well-rounded team.
When the movie was finished, we and the people around us all praised it without hesitation.
I have already recommended my best friend to go there, and she just saw the film and was equally delighted.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, more people will discover it, shoot their own style, rather than being uniform.
I am very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and a memorable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work 😘😘
Thank you for the comments from Xiaoyu. It is also a kind of fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to know you. If there is a chance, I will come to Qinhuangdao to play next time.
How do I give money?

A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we need to look at the strength of the faculty of this institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and it is best to inquire about the students of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the course is good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with personal circumstances.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, and even in which city, these will all be related to the industry you want to study or engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one is expensive to learn, and the other is time-consuming. Basically, it takes 3-6 months to concentrate on training. § Code   § END
But if it's the situation I'm talking about, self-study is very convenient. Nowadays, many learning resources on the internet are free, or you can go to B station to find many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or consult in detail.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also afford a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning is not very laborious, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, there are also people who answer questions specifically, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal recommendation quotas, recommend to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job search interview can save a lot of things.
These are my opinions. Because I don't know your situation, I can only introduce them briefly and not in detail. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would be there before 1 o'clock, and I saw it in the app too.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted furnace water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional grouting, and housekeeping services.
Thank those who silently give me likes, work hard for life. Life is tired but continue.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, if you like it, please follow me, thank you to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, and support themselves in the process. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. The road can be looked back, but not walked back...
Cleaning is not only a job, but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer. At that moment, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Feng Gui Home Services help you achieve "clean" as much as I can, serve the family.
Keep the family clean and tidy, serve the family well, and keep the house clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will also lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success can only be achieved by doing things with heart, and shaping delicacy with meticulousness. We are serious about sewing.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, the quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is trustworthy, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
Nowadays, it's hard to do anything!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The day is planned in the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and good luck. Good morning, keep a good mood all day.
When we were young, happiness was something that we had and we were happy; when we grew up, happiness became a goal that we had to achieve to be happy; when we matured, we realized that happiness is actually a state of mind and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regret in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good health and good mood, live brightly and beautifully until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Many times, what binds you is not ability, but the courage to face things actively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
The organizer of the China-Saudi Arabia joint exhibition, the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, is partnering with the New China News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12 that the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriya Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriya JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriye Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, Tian Feiyu, serving as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "feeling the stones to cross the river", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian social and cultural development. ---
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones Across the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also attracting attention, some of them use recycled materials in a novel way to create, for example, Xu Bing in "The Story Behind the Series of Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014), using waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
The CEO of the Diriye Foundation, Barkly, said that he hopes that this biennial exhibition will establish international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions. ---
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennial is twofold, to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennial exhibition, and artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art. ---

Yunnan: Coordinate and regulate the management of rural public welfare positions - Xinhua News Agency
In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of the poor population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies on the management of public welfare positions in rural revitalization to help promote rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment and income growth, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improving rural public service capabilities.
This new regulation is jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for grassroots public welfare positions, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of the development and setting of positions, the new regulations clearly stipulate that the development and setting of positions should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "position setting according to demand, person-position matching, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulated that the development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare positions; and required relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I reorder.
Is it already cancelled?
Although the right-wing has had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. Therefore, their shortness is due to their tendency to flourish in the sun and sweat in the water. When they are successful, they tend to look down on others, but when they are hit, they tend to attach themselves to others.
But to be fair, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining the standard of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of governance and protecting human rights.
Third, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and also very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social issues of China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm to people's livelihoods, political groups mixing together, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunism are not right-wingers, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left side again.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. Then the left has no such fate, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Recently, I saw some friends scolding the anti-traitors while refuting the left-wingers, which was quite impressive. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the rebels and the left-wingers admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the traitor scolds you for five cents, when the left-handed scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget them when they are old, or pursue them but become obsessed.
The ideal gradually becomes distant, and even the young dragon slayer becomes an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraints and freedom. China's overall tendency should be left-leaning due to its innate historical and cultural genes.
The domestic right-wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is certain to be left-leaning, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up and be done with it.
I won't say anything else, Flower is just so chivalrous.
In recent years, the US's blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for "US-based" companies.
The United States has suppressed China's chip industry and demanded that its own companies and allied countries' relevant companies simultaneously block China's chip industry, resulting in the global chip supplier's orders and profits being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and reduced production capacity of chip production enterprises, resulting in a shortage of chips in the global supply chain.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down, mobile phone prices rising, and almost all industries using chips are severely affected.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' technology giants are beginning to move towards the "de-Americanization" road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrict the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, either hosting the "Chip Summit" or inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and subsidizing domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the old American technology giant Intel has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip contract manufacturing
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to steal TSMC's "bread and butter".
The reason for this is that, as an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, Intel has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of talented teams and technical reserves, and must be able to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was amazing, and he had no hesitation in saying that Intel's investment in building a wafer factory was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the semiconductor field is because Zhang Zhongmou still remembers the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the American manufacturing industry, occupying the global peak position and dominating the world semiconductor field.
Up until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a small number of powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were completed from design, manufacturing to final testing by a single factory, with Intel representing that era.
However, this pattern puts a heavy burden on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only step back in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the appeal of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a special design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality and TSMC was born.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing" and provides only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was just a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, decisively refusing to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel at the time looked down on wafer process services.
It is unexpected that the giants who looked down on the semiconductor manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry business.
Nowadays, TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally dare not be complacent.
Nowadays, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting anymore.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.😅
Today we will look at some strange hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon raises its head, Haolaiyou price increase, and Huolala incident. Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index declines (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look exactly the same as the [Network Public Opinion Evolution Model] shown on the website of the Network Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in a "solitary peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" shape.
"Isolated peak" refers to artificial heating, quickly rushing to the hot search list, causing public attention; "sawtooth" refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; "cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has completed its "function", and is ready to receive new tasks and rush to the new battlefield. 【题目】翻译下列句子
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, and the time is divided into seconds without error. It must be a unified batch of water soldiers receiving the task and launching a new round of attacks.
The specialization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite war, which shift the line of sight, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which wrap up decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuning operations, almost considering all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Everyone who has passed by will leave a trace, and we will dig out such traces together.
The data source is the hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of Omicron Rho virus infection.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on December 12 that Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Delta strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron Rho strain infection on the 10th.
According to Minister of Health Kailash Jugutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected individual is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative and they have returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain of the virus.
These three people are all students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they are all mild cases, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho strain, the government of Cai is constantly increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport after arriving in SARS.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's Health Minister, Kumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had found its first three cases of Omicron infection.

I received the money belly.
The order is a phoenix claw.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff to explain #NAME#.
Our rider told me that the address is too far.
Great beauty 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, 156 Huan Cheng South Road.
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and see. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
This is the first time I have come to the store. I just showed them my floor plan, but they did not measure the house on site. They were able to give me a quotation for my 135 square meter house for 70,000 yuan, and they showed me their materials, but I don't know what brand they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money is never refundable unless you have enough experience and theoretical warfare with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you could get if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated, when I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 deposits.
The quote he gave me has many problems. 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything before making me sign the contract.
When I went to ask them for a refund, they showed a very experienced look, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, the customer's problem will be bitten to death and they are completely blameless.
There are various excuses for responsibility, and many details. I don't want to talk about them one by one. In short, don't choose them because my friend's house decorated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees later.
They are the original scammers of Longtou Decoration, now changed to Damei, and it seems that they have closed down and changed to something else.
Therefore, everyone should not choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when everyone is choosing, they should Baidu and consult these consultants because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews. Please see the merchant inclusion statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration, so if you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
It's so scary, please cancel the order if you can't get here within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If the money is not refunded within 5 to 10 days, it will definitely be pursued.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes or less.

The constellation of Gemini will have a meteor shower on the 14th, which will be very large - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Gemini meteor shower, will be at its peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
Astronomy enthusiasts in Beijing took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be "gestated" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like the New Year's Eve blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is called one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower. ---
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor body is relatively slow, colorful, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Gemini meteor shower will peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR of 150 under ideal observation conditions.
The meteor shower of Gemini is recommended on the index chart.
Last year, the "falling petals" of the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered with by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th, it is the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is a full moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight when the moon sets, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a northeast-facing view in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait for the moon to set, and then observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower in all directions is large, and it is not necessary to always stare at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography want to take beautiful "meteor shower" shots, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential.
Xiulipeng reminds us.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs obviously focus more on the large-screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens. ---
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of global shipments and sales of laser TVs has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches or more.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, the sales of laser TVs in 2020 will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for the good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection. ---
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye, compared to the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute's Sae West Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts have conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have a certain improvement effect in specific areas.
In the current era where visual health is increasingly valued, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It must be reasonable.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that liquid crystal TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, the equipment loss is small, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge for yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle close-focus projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fyodor screens is costly, and the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it on the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. It's serious to compare LCD TVs with diffuse "direct" light. When the TV is turned on, isn't the ceiling also illuminated?
And, if the projection screen cloth is not diffuse reflection, it can't be like at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen cloth was precisely ignored. At a certain angle, a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.
The Wen Photography Gallery, specializing in visual aesthetics, has not yet opened any branches.
After adding WeChat to make a reservation, the lady arranged the available time for me and replied to the message promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, very beautiful, involving many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a simple conversation with the saleswoman about my ideas, and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was indecisive about. In the end, we decided to start with makeup and styling. Before the photographer took the photos, he would set up some props and guide the movements, and he was also very meticulous about the details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted didn't come out, but it should be nice to look at.
After the shoot, the photographer will help select photos and communicate post-production style. He seems to be very careful.
It will take about half a month to fix the film, waiting for the effect~
I won the second time in the photo shoot type of bully meal activity ~ most of the clothes in the whole field can be selected for shooting.
In the end, I chose a black chiffon skirt to try out a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the 95-year-old younger brother, feeling a little bit green, hoping to give more suggestions in the customer shooting action guidance in the future ~ very talkative, the shooting process is quite pleasant.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores for reply.
Back to the homepage, let's also take a look at Queenie~
First fill in your name and phone number at the store, then choose your clothing. You can choose a wedding dress. I tried on three or four sets of clothing and the staff was very patient. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, the photographer will teach you how to pose. The only downside is that the photos make my face look big. They said that the retouching would take half a month, but I received them
The overall environment is still good. 【环境】整体还好。 The overall environment is still good. 【环境】整体还好。 The overall environment is still good. 【环境】整体还好。 The overall environment is still good. 【
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup positions inside the photography studio.
The service is very warm and attentive. 【翻译】这项服务非常热情，也非常细心。 The service is very warm and attentive. 【翻译】服务非常热情，也非常
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
Experience: The original double eyelids may have been over-modeled and turned into triple eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily use without eyebrows.
The photos were given ten days ago, but the P-picture effect is not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I wasn't quite sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets. In the end, I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more Hepburn retro.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The final result was very satisfying.
After putting on makeup and doing my hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots for retouching. The little brother said that the final product would be ready within 15 minutes, and the ending was very satisfying.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can you exempt me first, and then collect my monthly fee after you have investigated, is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
The Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 50 million yuan. It must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good shareholder behavior. As an insurance brokerage company, Xiaoyusan Insurance does not need to be questioned about its legitimacy, after all, not every insurance company can meet these three thresholds.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest He Tai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, the claim party and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode, the products of Internet platforms are generally more cost-effective because they do not have the operating costs of business outlets and the salaries of sales staff. In addition, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure on the insured, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the salesperson, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In the areas of health notification and occupation, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing on "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the second month is need to be charged according to the normal fee, dozens to 200, many customers charge for one or two years themselves buy is not clear.
Thinking that you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company will pay 6 million (the world falls apart).
Free mobile phones are only given to policyholders with special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning SMS is sent out, no one will remind you if you do not redeem it yourself.
This is another pitfall for the insured person. The free 60000 critical illness coverage is short-term. If you rely on this alone without other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60000 can't do anything, can't solve the problem, and the future life begins to run naked.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the salesmanperson.
It is suggested that the questioner should carefully consider the comprehensive situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have a better cost-performance ratio than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, insured offline products, and saved each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingya insurance broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience. I have served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before underwriting, I will tailor insurance products based on customer needs, and during underwriting, I will compare the goods for customers and strive to achieve the best underwriting results for customers. After underwriting, I will do policy sorting and policy custody for customers, so that customers can be reassured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance process by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the purchase of internet insurance may not have a "ceremonial" feel, and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" pipeline operation, but such insurance purchases may also have a fatal problem, that is, the subsequent service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services for us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?

Just get the discount code back.
No problem, remember not to arrange resending, I have already bought it separately, and don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Since you started sending me friend requests on Facebook and posting sarcastic posts, and then trying to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude.
After you change, not only do you continue to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but you also continue to discuss some of my hidden, embarrassing comments on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments on my appearance, body shape, good health, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed, etc. I can't stand it anymore. I'm sorry, but I have to block you.
How do I know that later I received more friends sending me your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After my news of reporting the police was uploaded, you didn't calm down at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, nor do I care what your identity and status are. In our society, respect for both sexes is needed.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, implicit, embarrassing, insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are only caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to publish all offensive statements.
You're right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to let herself be humiliated like this in exchange for fame.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl who has been bullied like this can still say she's okay.
Only those who have no basic moral character would choose to harm any woman in this way, whether in work, society, politics or business.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I have cut some of the comments for everyone to judge.
You should not be able to impersonate yourself on the post you made.
I can only say that you are a civilized public enemy.
A smile of understanding.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 11 that the Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation on the 10th as scheduled. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Sichuan Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
Thus, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The Minister of Transport, Jiang Hao, the deputy director of the Water Administration Bureau, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the ability to receive Yangtze River ship pollutants and improve shipping services has been significantly enhanced.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and sailors, helping sailors solve "urgent and anxious" problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, realizing the "one-time berthing, multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of sailors sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is visiting Guam, an important signal to the US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the US Navy's "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the "Karl Winson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which set sail from the US on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squad for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region and is docked in Yokosuka, Japan. ---
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shangpulan Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stoke Darr" missile destroyer.
The three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam on January 17, 2022. The "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that the US military's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the strongest weapons are rarely visiting Guam on January 17, 2022.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, a nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and several nuclear warheads, entered the US Guam naval base last Saturday (January 15th).
The US's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, with the strongest weapons making a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that an American ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second time it has publicly visited Guam since the 1980s.
The US has assembled its three aircraft carriers around China, and its most powerful weapons have rarely visited Guam. China has been building a large number of military facilities on the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
The US Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region during its visit to Guam, demonstrating the US's ability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of 14 "Thundering Submarine" in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine around which the "Thundering Submarine" became the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad also includes launch wells for ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, the market value evaporated by $251 billion, and Zuckerberg responded to "unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps external Meta's advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is to realize monetization.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's adjustment of its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has about a hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, and most of the money is spent on Meta.
It is interesting to note that TT, the current byte, is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from bytes in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but also on the future expectations.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "primordial universe".
The primordial universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the implementation period of the primordial universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now and has an annual income of $100-200 billion, it actually has a strong sense of crisis and does not have a good security moat compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software now has a high daily activity and is also a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of the primordial universe is unattainable in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and constantly seeks new avenues. However, I think his choice of avenue is wrong and is a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
