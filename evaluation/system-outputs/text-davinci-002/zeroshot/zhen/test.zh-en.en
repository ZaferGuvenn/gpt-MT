At Zhejiang University's annual academic conference, students sang the lead role and research results were mind-blowing.
Washing your hands with air and judging diseases by your breath may sound like science fiction, but these were just some of the cutting-edge research projects honored at Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Conference yesterday evening.
The main researchers of these results are students, and the research covers environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, and humanities education. From a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value. Some of the projects have won awards domestically and internationally.

English:
All you need to do is breathe out gently, and this machine will be able to give you a preliminary idea of your body's health from the composition of the gas you breathe out.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected with the smart phone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after the gas is exhaled.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market usually detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, as its target. The chemical element is sensitive to "smell", so it can more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Smart operating lights: high-energy eyes for doctors.
English:
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, graduate students of the School of Optoelectronics and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
Many diseases are detected early and removed improperly, related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Sheng Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot see all tumor tissue clearly during early cancer detection, cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This kind of smart operating light has four light discs. By adjusting the spectrum, the contrast of different tissues under light is enhanced.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of surgery and personal habits.
This type of intelligent operating lamp has been trial-used in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: Save water and be cool.
Most people just wash their hands with water, at most using some soap or hand sanitizer. However, students like Li Qi-zhang have invented a "air hand-washing device."
English:
It's like a pump.
The air that is compressed forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
English:
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleanliness, but also save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-saving, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold prize.

A certificate that feels very meaningful - a first-aid certificate.
This is one of the most important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
English:
It is well known that there is actually a period of time after an accident before the ambulance arrives, and it is this period of time that is most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes, four golden minutes, to save our lives!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone falls down next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too scary.
In China, we have three million official deaths from accidents each year, with heart failure being the most dangerous.
In the United States, the national average is 15% that can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, the figure is below 1%.
This is what the founder of the First Response said.
If a person's heart stops, their breathing and heartbeat will stop too. Pinching them will not do anything.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compressions to have a chance of saving someone.
I find that few people now have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
Maybe it could even save a life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
English:
I'm going to take other exams for certificates that I want, and I'm planning to get a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there's also a diving first-aid certificate. It seems like you need a first-aid certificate to take this one, so the first-aid certificate is actually still useful!

My personal opinion is that "Four Seas" is a complete disaster from all aspects.
English:
There are many different kinds of bad movies, like the ones that make you fall asleep in the theater, or the ones that make you angry after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for audiences, igniting their anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted when it comes to insulting his audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a Greek myth, indescribable and full of holes, like the windbreaker on Little Pony.
Even after watching it, you'll wonder if there are any hidden metaphors from the director, but after thinking about it carefully, you'll realize it's just a pile of shit.
It's hard for me to understand some of the plot points.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part of the world, depending on his grandmother for life.
English:
An elderly person sitting in a bread truck going from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very worried about this.
The old man then had no more to say.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
English:
Then the truck in the middle of the road that was delivering rebar stopped on the side of the road, and the drivers of the trucks around it couldn't be found.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit history and criminal suspicion become a police officer?
Why didn't you report the high-interest loan? The police in the movie even asked if you were in trouble.
A grown adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key card to open the door, and then forces themselves to sleep outside the room all night because they can't find the hotel owner?
This inexplicable plot is interwoven throughout the film and I remember it painfully because the plot is so far-fetched.
The plot is not the only thing that is bad, the movie's main point is worse, or rather the movie has no main point, it is just a repulsive patchwork of monsters.
At the beginning of the movie, you think he's going to make a comedy. 20 minutes later, you think it might be a motivational film. Halfway through, you think it might be a film about how hard it is for small-town youth to survive. After watching it, you have no idea what you just watched, and you're left with a deep sense of doubt about why you would want to go to the movies and watch poop over the New Year holiday.
Most people are actually very familiar with the tropes of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, it would be a motivational + comedy telling the audience how a talented novice step by step to success.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should tell the story of the grievances between the young town motorcycle driver and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot include things that are contradictory to the normal world.
For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zhengyan played was just burned, and then the character who could sing could not go to open some of Kennedy's unprovoked ideas.
It's not clear whether the female lead's acting like a five-year-old in some ways because she's supposed to be mentally challenged or because the director wanted her to.
I don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes to his own movies?
This kind of movie arrangement during the Spring Festival period, is it to give the audience a blockage?

The Chongqing Vocational School is piloting a modern apprenticeship system in which students are treated as potential employees of enterprises upon enrollment.
The reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission yesterday that, starting from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 vocational schools, and students who accept the pilot training will also have the identity of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that standardized procedures be established for the enrollment and employment of apprentices by secondary vocational schools and enterprises, that the dual identity of apprentices as students of secondary vocational schools and employees of enterprises be made clear, and that three-party agreements be signed by apprentices, schools, and enterprises in accordance with the principle of two-way selection. For apprentices who are 16 years of age or older but not yet 18, four-party agreements must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of the parties concerned and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests protection to be provided for the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship model and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot school will reform the talent training mode.
School and enterprise jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program will last for one cycle, during which time students will intern with businesses for a period of time determined by the professional training program, with on-the-job training generally lasting for six months.
Enterprises should implement an enterprise team-based management model in their practices. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can take 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
In accordance with the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs, each with a population of about 50, training a total of about 3000 students (apprentices).
According to the principle of piloting first and then promoting, from point to surface, gradually exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education of school-enterprise, so as to improve students' skills and employment quality.

South African doctors: although Olivier Rouke is highly infectious, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omikron variant is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron strain spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Hauden reports that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, similar to those of influenza.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
English:
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become severely ill from coronavirus infection.
English:
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
English:
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks are in serious condition, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent new coronavirus patients have died, while in South Africa. The early outbreak had a mortality rate of 20%.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying: "Almost all the evidence currently indicates that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to get later data."
English:
Scientists all over the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Deltara is still the world's main coronavirus strain, Omikron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December increased by 400%. Tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omikron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Times: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service announcement "No buying, no selling, no murder", then in a good environment without the demand for "trafficking", group prevention and group control, everyone's anti-trafficking, make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, this kind of crime will not happen again and again.
The Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Bureau's child trafficking information emergency release platform has recently gone online.
This is an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children, and an Internet information platform for the timely retrieval of abducted children.
I've heard that this app is called "Tuan Yuan" and it feels very warm.
The new technology is not only called "literary" and full of feeling, but also properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to find and rescue trafficked children and protect their physical safety and freedom.
The trial and punishment of the suspect come second.
The significance of criminal punishment can be enumerated with many "big words", from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
English:
We should prioritize urgent matters over less urgent ones. Under the urgent goal of "rescue", topics with much debate and controversy such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" can be put aside for now and discussed cautiously. However, things like rescuing trafficked children cannot be delayed.
After successfully carrying out a human trafficking case, the traffickers will quickly leave the area where the crime took place.
English:
In this case, taking out effective methods such as the "reunion" platform to crack the case and find the child is a practical action.
After all, " combating trafficking" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to work well.
We need to implement the principle of "protecting the young and helping the weak" in every aspect, from perfecting legislation to safeguarding judicial rights, to ensuring strict law enforcement.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three at the train station to rest, parents sleep, wake up to find the child is gone.
English:
Parents taking turns resting or placing their children in safe custody are the least they can do to prevent them from being abducted.
English:
Single illegal acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and their property shall be confiscated.
The starting point for punishment is high and the maximum punishment is heavy, which obviously belongs to a heavier punishment under the trend of "leniency".
There are still a lot of trafficking cases happening every year.
It is clear that some people's ideas about raising children are outdated and their awareness of the law is weak.
The legal education of this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking in persons, law enforcement by government officials cannot be the only measure.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, traffickers are motivated by greed, and they constantly innovate new ways to traffic, resulting in a "struggle" between them and law enforcement, anti-trafficking efforts are bound to become bogged down in inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking through backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to crack down on the crimes of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Hao-tung gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Conference at Malan Mountain.
Draw strength from the Party's 100-year struggle history to forge ahead.
On the morning of December 10th, Yang Haidong, a member of the Provincial Standing Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an interactive lecture at the video and cultural park of Malanshan to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and speeches on Hunan. Learn and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haidong, from the perspective of idealistic beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leaders and party theory, combined with his own understanding and personal experience, explained the core meaning and practical requirements of the plenary session in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should study the spirit of the conference, General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech in Hunan, and the instructions and suggestions of the provincial party congress, so that we can understand and implement them. We should also enhance our awareness of defending "two establishments" and ensuring "two maintenance", and resolutely follow General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance and move forward.
At the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives raised questions about the relationship between three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the party's history of 100 years. Yang Haodong answered these questions one by one with popular language and vivid examples. He sent a sincere message to Party members, urging them to take inspiration and strength from the Party's 100-year struggle, unite closely around the Party Central Committee, and follow the Party with unswerving loyalty, using their youth to contribute to a sense of responsibility and mission.
The number of college graduates in Beijing is expected to reach 268,000 in 2022.
The Beijing Municipal Education Commission and the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau jointly held a video conference on employment and entrepreneurship of college graduates in 2022. It is estimated that there will be 268,000 college graduates in the Beijing area in 2022, 16,000 more than last year.

Extra virgin olive oil is the highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The flavor is excellent, with a gentle and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.

Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from the first cold pressing of olives with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or from the second pressing of olives.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
English:
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: This is olive oil that has been extracted from the residue and refined by dissolution.
You should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil, from looking at the grading system.
You need to know that olives are like grapes used to make wine. Olives from different regions and different olive varieties will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives is:
The Mediterranean coast has the most ideal climate conditions for olive trees to grow, including the right kind of soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only grow sporadically in suitable areas.
The main producing areas are the Mediterranean countries.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, have similar climates as countries located far south such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
The month of olive picking:
The time of year when olive trees flower and fruit is from March to June, and the fruit ripens and matures from July to October, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The picking season for olives is from November to February (freshness is very important for olive oil).
The nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as in vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found in oils so far.
The Democratic summit has ended, and Biden has said that the fire of freedom will never go out.
The online "Summit for Democracy," called by US President Biden and attended by leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, came to a close on Friday, December 10.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
The Taiwanese government representative, Tang Feng, and the current Hong Kong democracy rights activist, Lo Kwong-chung, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
We also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I've said before, the democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"A dictatorship can never extinguish the tiny fire of freedom in the world; it burns in the hearts of people everywhere."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be more resistant to the forces of authoritarianism and those who nakedly seek power before public interests."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" will focus on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day falls on "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his opening remarks that the cause of democracy was under challenge globally, particularly from the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and principles, and our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong gave a speech at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and leaders from civil society must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.
English:
He said, "Some of you may be afraid of offending President Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat the Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan's Government Affairs Committee Commissioner Tang Feng, during an attendance of a "Fight Against Digital Authoritarianism, Affirm Democratic Values" roundtable discussion, through a video release of a "National Statement", stressed that Taiwan stands on the front line of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared how to fight the new coronavirus pandemic by building transparency and trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is taking root in Taiwan, we have always stood on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the outbreak, authoritarian governments around the world have justified their infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to a global retreat of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the fake information to win.
The United States Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, for serious human rights violations on the second day of the "Democratic Summit." At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was found to be using surveillance technology to help violate human rights.
I have taken and uploaded the photos for you.
I know.
The restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
It turns out I need #NUMBER#.
I'm not going to call.
I don't want to eat anymore.
I will definitely complain.
You can't send it, why didn't you say so earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
I've been waiting for my food for half an hour.
None of the #PRS_ORG# have been sent.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not give up?
The saliva chicken that the restaurant sent is alive.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that's not too different to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then the normal situation is more expensive than the cheap shot friendly, such "entry-level clap" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and vibrates a lot, the hard ball can't hold on, and the masters are difficult to control.
The logic and unspoken premise behind their existence is--tennis is so difficult, we know you can't learn, and we also know you're unwilling to buy something expensive, so we'll trick you with a cheap knock-off and you'll only play a few times before giving up, which is good for us because it's cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
English:
It is suggested that you spend a similar amount of money to buy a used racket that is slightly better. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets are not expensive. The new one is 500 or 600, and the used one is 200. Isn't it enjoyable to have a racket that costs a thousand yuan?
It's friendly to newcomers, but it's a chicken once you get past the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
English:
To postpone
Thank you
So you're saying I already have credit?

Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salivary chicken was raw.
PRS_ORG said they would cancel my service for no reason, please help.
I placed an order for delivery, there is absolutely no way to pick it up.

Actually, there are many ways to dress if you are a girl with a little bit of extra weight.
English:
Skirts that are too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Being too tall makes people look short and fat.
If you wear three sections, it will make you look taller. The top, skirt, and long socks should be different colors to create a lengthening effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly overweight girls (the author has this experience), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Black short skirts are also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular the better, and the colors shouldn't be too bright.
To avoid people noticing your legs and feet, and making them feel fat.
English:
Don't wear tight, short skirts if you're a little overweight. Also, don't wear shirts that are too short or that tuck into your skirt. It's really uncomfortable to look at. If you have thick legs, wear black, long socks or fishnet socks (the kind with small holes). Choose a soft, printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman shirt to cover up a little overweight girl's flaws.
Of course, there are also tips for girls with a little more meat on their bones when it comes to wearing short skirts.
A chubby girl should choose a top that is the same color as her short skirt. This will make her look taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a top-heavy MM with skinny legs, opt for a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show your strengths.
A-line skirts are slimming and look good on girls who are on the heavier side. Choose a fitted top to create a layered look that will make you appear even thinner.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt is also a good choice for chubby MM.
A girl with a little bit of extra weight can also look fashionable.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, then even slightly overweight girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.

The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League is helping to fuel the Winter Olympics enthusiasm.
December 11, Beijing Dream ING team player Pang Yao天（中）in the game shot.
The 2021-2022 Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued its competition at various ice rinks in Beijing on the same day.
This year's league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with participants aged U6 to U18. There are two groups, the competitive group and the selection group, which attract nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams in the city.
The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has developed for more than ten years and has now become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to learn skills and make friends, and also a training ground for Beijing youth ice hockey teams and youth teams.
The league plays a leading role in promoting Beijing's youth ice hockey sports and igniting the enthusiasm for the Winter Olympics, laying the foundation for the development of Beijing's ice hockey sports in the post-Winter Olympic period.
"It's just a flesh wound," said the girl when she became a target for her sister's fundraising.
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square is standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' for her sister to raise donations" swept through her friends' circles.
A photo shows a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than a person. The board has the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that passersby can pay to shoot arrows at the target.
This behavior has caused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity for Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Downtown Branch confirmed to a New Beijing News reporter that police had determined that the girl had only taken such extreme action in order to solicit donations for her sister, but that this sort of behavior was not worth promoting. After being admonished, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
A girl who solicited donations by "shooting arrows" on the street was scolded.
In pictures circulating online, a long-haired girl is seen standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written in black ink. In front of her is another wooden board with her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay account numbers, etc.
The image caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with this.
We discovered the situation around 10 o'clock in the morning when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers.
The police officers from the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with the local media that there were two girls selling goods at the stall, both around 20 years old and dressed beautifully.
The girl who was being used as "bait" was crying and begging passersby to play the game; the other girl was standing next to her, yelling that her friend's sister had leukemia and needed money for surgery.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
The publicity department head of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng sub-bureau told the New Beijing News reporter last night that the girl's name was Jijiali and that she was raising donations for her sister Jijiayan.
English:
He said that during the whole process, two girls were targets, and one was responsible for shooting, but neither of them were involved. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
The police department has determined that the bow and arrow used does not fall under the category of controlled items.
The person in charge said that "we don't advocate this way of begging for donations."
The police officers at the station warned her and she left the station.
The cooling effect is good, the degree of thinness is convenient, the appearance material is satisfied, and the Acer is always high in cost performance.
This new machine is great.
The performance is stable, the four exhaust outlets are not a problem, and it is recommended.
This Acer Aspire VX15 gaming laptop is pretty good, with plenty of features and a trusted brand!
The Acer Aspire V15 Nitro Black Edition is not too expensive.
I personally think that the Acer Predator Helios 300 Dragon Edition is really good. Game performance is smooth and can play most games easily. My chicken dinner runs at a very high frame rate and is very smooth. LOL is even better. CSgo is also easy to win. Most of the AAA games can be played.
The cooling effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quiet, and the game effect is not small when the fan is fully open.
The exterior material is very cool and stylish, and the game notebook is very cool. The display effect is very clear, and playing games in 1080 is enough.
I think the laptop is really good, mainly because it's for design and the price is really good. It's lighter than I thought and it looks better than I thought. The color of the grape on the butt is really good. It's not so tacky. The overall value is much higher than expected. It's a good purchase for girls.
I started using Acer Aspire V5 two years ago and it's been a great investment. The quality is superb and it's very cost-effective!
I also recommend this product to my friends around me!
I've already bought three machines in this series!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also good.
I bought this for my nephew and was going to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The price is pretty good and the shipping is pretty fast. I'll review it again after using it for a while.
This is a brand new, high-value gaming laptop with a great design. It comes with Windows 11 and Office 2019 installed.

What is the most popular in 2021?
The Tokyo Olympics is undoubtedly the best.
You think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was an article called "Quick, Look! Project Managers Can Impact the Gold Medal Olympic Project" that was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, project managers are definitely the frontrunners that no one can compete with: carrying bricks, business trips, and working late nights are part of a project manager's daily routine, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are a given.
It seems like a joke, but it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, which represent the powerlessness of current project management work.
English:
The number of people signing up for the PMP (Project Management Professional) certification, which is internationally recognized, is increasing every year, indicating that more and more project management practitioners are improving their skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide has reached nearly 600,000, and the number of certified PMP® has reached 420,000. The number of valid certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders worldwide.
The number of PMP-certified individuals has been increasing year by year over the past 10 years, which shows that an increasing number of project managers have realized that it is no longer feasible to simply follow "old experience" and that the ever-changing work environment requires us to learn from the giants of science to explore the way forward.
However, does taking the PMP guarantee smooth sailing for project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other relevant courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields of project management and the five major process groups, but when they really do project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management awareness, purely relying on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to implement them in practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, unable to implement in work, poor estimation of projects, poor control and sensitivity of projects, and projects being constantly delayed; unclear division of labor among members, and "old hands" in the team not knowing how to deal with them; poor communication among departments, and projects being difficult to promote.
Therefore, for over ten years, we have been focused on product innovation and R&D management, which has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Tianhuanghuaxia Consulting came to us with the online course of "Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
This is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods from research and development enterprises, to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on your own journey of advanced project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, and to bring efficient results to businesses.

The course will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help students apply what they have learned to specific work after class.

Credit China "Double Twelve" before the consumer advocates rational consumption - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
77 trillion yuan in online payment transactions were made during this year's "Double Eleven" holiday, setting a new record.
The numerous discounts and coupons available, as well as the alluring live-streamed product demonstrations, have once again enticed consumers and led to cries of benefits. On one hand, this consumer craze makes one lament the ever-growing spending power of the people. On the other hand, it is necessary to calm down and think about the effects of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blindly consume and over-consume.
The national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019, according to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year.
In general, Chinese residents perform better in financial consumption than in financial behavior and skills, but there are still great disparities that need to be addressed by further improving basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and teenagers are relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the key focus of financial education. The "China Young People's Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, it is very different from the "over-indulgence" label attached to the outside world. Part of the younger generation does have excessive consumption and following consumption behavior, which has caused too much financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take on social responsibilities and guide in a positive direction.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been dedicated to helping people build their happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of regulation, in order to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
For many years now, CreditEase has been carrying out all-round, diversified financial literacy campaigns targeting young people, including university students, and subtly guiding their consumption needs in the right direction through initiatives such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovation practice competitions, helping them develop a rational approach to consumption and plan their consumption needs sensibly, thereby accumulating wealth over their lifetime.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer borrowing mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Always plan your spending in advance and only spend what you can afford to repay on time.
If you are late, the late record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on your future economic life, such as buying a car or house.
While enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, CreditEase will continue to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products, continuously helping the public improve their financial literacy, and helping consumers develop the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing. CreditEase will be a trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers throughout their lives.

The Vietnamese People's Committee on Cooperation in the Gulf - Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has visited Qatar since the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a complete embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the ASEAN and had negative impacts on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have cut off land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing a new ambassador to Qatar.
The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council are working to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, in the interests of all countries in the region and the need for unity to face common challenges.
English:
The725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of supply chains for the citizens of the two countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf States coincides with Iran's negotiations with major world powers over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to address Iran's missile issue.
The Gulf States have long considered Iran a "competitor" and its nuclear program a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed not to take action to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to curb Iran's activities in the region.
English:
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to the slowdown in the growth of the GCC economies.
The upcoming summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar came to an end.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the GCC's unity and to put forward measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

I don't know either. Data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. That's probably when myvi only reaches 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h.

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that a university has accumulated over a long period of development, which is the soul of the university.
The spirit of the university has been of paramount importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation since ancient times.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shoulderd a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they arose in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the times. They advocated the value concept of "promoting morality and benefiting the world, repairing and governing the country", and the patriotism of "promoting education and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly obvious. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is constantly intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply-side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
The proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" shows not only the confidence and determination of China's progress from a country with higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to join the ranks of the world's top in a shorter period of time, and on the basis of still having a certain gap, accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines, so as to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having confidence in its goals, path, and ability, universities should also make full use of their three advantages: first, their latecomer advantage. They can continuously introduce outstanding academic talents from overseas and learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, so as to significantly improve their academic level and quality of running a school; second, their cultural advantage. They can inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, carry forward and develop excellent traditional cultures, so as to consolidate strength, shape brands, and improve their image; third, their institutional advantage. They can make use of the advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal-orientedness, gather consensus and joint efforts, and optimize resource allocation, so as to provide sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to realize that it is impossible for all universities to be world-class, and each university must show its individuality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The school's characteristics should not only reflect the common Chinese characteristics, but also the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
Zhejiang University focuses on three areas in its educational endeavors: first, cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated environment for integrating education with science and technology, and industry, and forming a complete entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, promoting the convergence of disciplines, optimizing and adjusting the disciplinary system, creating a system environment for disciplinary convergence, and actively cultivating emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, promoting the characteristics of the educational system and social service, deepening international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a system of cooperation between production, education and research in Zhejiang.
It is especially important to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth from Facts and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Virtue, Discernment, and Pragmatism", and the common aspirations of "Including All Rivers and Seas, Cultivating True Virtue, Opening Up to the World, and Building Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
"Hainan River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodies the vision of "using talents from all over the world", and manifests itself in absorbing the quality education concepts of world-renowned universities; "Qizhenhoude" emphasizes the pursuit of truth and goodness, which refers to the university's pursuit of truth while also being tempered by morality and personality; "Kaiwuqianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of knowledge, research innovation, and also the reform and development, and innovation; "Shuwobangguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always be in the same boat with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is precisely where the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of operation lies.
The wise listen in silence, the intelligent see in the formless.
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission and development direction of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, universities stimulate each other with the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, and the spirit of the nation, so as to provide endless motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

When NFTs are hot, a new concept emerges in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic beginning to earn a stable income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology that combines various gameplay with NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, exceeding 3 billion US dollars to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds $8.2 million, surpassing "King Glory".
English:
The popularity of Axie Infinity is introducing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer just single characters in the game; they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem and earn economic benefits from it.
This sense of agency is not granted by the game developers, but rather ensured by blockchain technology.
I was most struck by the company's choice of track, that is, the choice of industry for investment targets, first of all to choose an industry with large growth space, at least 1 trillion market size; secondly, to choose an industry with good future growth, considering that the industry will reach its best state in 3-5 years; finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the track is flat or rugged referring to the competition pattern of the industry.

The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The key to success is "doing the things right", that is, doing things correctly.
Strategy is about "doing the right thing," which is doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding a direction, tactics are about implementation, and most tactical thinking has strategic thinking above it.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can also think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or expanding horizontally into new fields (strategic thinking); in terms of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing participation in activities (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right KPIs for the activity, achieve the right goals for the activity, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precise acquisition. , etc.; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American groups complain that Yale and other Ivy League schools discriminate against them in admissions.
Over 130 Asian American groups have filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on 23 May, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance held a press conference in Washington to launch its appeal.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at a press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of US colleges and universities has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three US colleges and universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian American applicants in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhaoyu Kong introduced that, in 2014, Sanders and other scholars' research showed that, in these three universities, Asian applicants had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that, among all the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in admissions.
They also hope that the universities they are complaining about will take active measures to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans.
The three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to complain about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, this appeal also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agent about a factory located in Zhoutian Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the family of the owner of the factory building about the details of the purchase, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit to the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou, as the payee, signed the "Factory Building Sale Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the contract within one week. "
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the scope of factory buildings for sale, payment methods and other major contract terms, the housing purchase and sale contract could not be signed for a long time.
Considering that the two sides were unable to reach a consensus on the contract content, Lin Mou returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
I finally found a house I liked and put down a deposit, and now the seller won't sell it to me. This has left Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Mr. Lu will sue Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court found that the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and that the defendant should not be solely responsible for this. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, and therefore the case should not be subject to the earnest money penalty. The defendant is not liable for double the return of the earnest money.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
The court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
Lawyers remind that in the course of transaction, one should exercise the necessary duty of care.
When signing a contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes when performing the contract.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States holding a "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing democracy, acting in the name of democracy but against it in reality, inciting splits and confrontation, and diverting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic reform,' imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'massive weapon of destruction' for the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference will be held via video, with 111 world leaders invited from including Taiwan's leader, but neither China nor Russia have been invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of criticism both internationally and domestically in the United States, for example, leaders with authoritarian tendencies who were invited to attend, such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, etc., some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden government is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
Just-inaugurated German Chancellor Schröder also participated in the video-conference democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sick, with money politics, identity politics, party conflict, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and rich-poor divisions." American democracy is based on the "rich man's game" of capitalism.
President Biden said in a speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the barriers of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be more resistant to the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must renew it in every generation, and I believe this is the defining challenge of our time."
English:
The United States has promised to launch a year-long initiative after the Democratic Summit, which will include a $424.4 million proposal to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific, public commitments to improve their democracy ahead of the Physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.

The authentic red wine tastes a little sour, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, lemon will bring a refreshing flavor to the wine, of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. You can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Education Thinking: How to Make "Geeks" and "Dummies" Get What They Deserve in University Exams-Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to their school leaders expressing their confusion about university exams and calling for the exams to be made more difficult and varied in order to more accurately reflect students' actual abilities.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
At university campuses, students come from all over the world with varying levels of ability and different levels of learning, making the situation of learning extremely diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions of assessment for such a diverse group of people.
Of course, if the test questions are single and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass by cramming right before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the results with half the effort.
So "lazy students" can pass the exam without studying, and even get high scores; "smart students" who never skip class, have good homework and notes, don't do much better on the exams.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without reason in reflecting the problems in university exams, and I believe that this situation is not only at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
English:
Actually, people who have gone to college know that it's not uncommon for students to try to get test questions from their teachers in advance, to try to get guidance on what will be on the test, or to ask for help after the test.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching and learning, the pass or fail of a university examination depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific proposition based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to specialize, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is what university exams test.
The knowledge in undergraduate courses is mostly about the basic theories and common sense of the disciplines, and from the perspective of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in college 20 years ago is still being studied and is still the focus."
Although the knowledge points are basically unchanged, it does not mean that the test questions are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject are coordinated to form the test paper. The examination and marking are also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
To design a set of test questions that are in line with teaching and learning realities, the questions should be normally distributed in terms of difficulty level, based on students' overall learning situation. Furthermore, a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation is needed, along with a comprehensive analysis of students' learning levels, in order to make the test questions dynamically graspable in terms of difficulty level and question type, so as to not only emphasize the testing of basic knowledge, but also take into account the testing of ability, while also innovatively designing the question types.
Exams are the driving force behind university education, and students will have corresponding study plans depending on the type of exam. In the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attach great importance to the letters of suggestions from students, and have deployed rectification plans throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out research and contrast self-examination of course final exams, formulate examination paper setting and relevant regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review, refine grading, and comprehensively assess all aspects of course teaching.
It is an issue that university examination affairs need to face that the question types are single and the questions are repeated from the perspective of mechanism, of course corresponding system need to be put forward, but the kung fu lies in the daily, teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, to understand both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual, so that "gifted students" and "stupid students" can each get what they want.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nanjie store) does not have branches yet.
We changed the time twice because we didn't have the time arranged before we took the photo, and the consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
We chose to shoot on a nice weekend later.
The staff of Mrs. Jin, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all great.
That was the first time I had ever done my makeup formally, wow~ I couldn't believe it, that one day I could look so good, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry I can't remember her name) are very patient with makeup and the makeup is also natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, and fortunately the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel too cold. When we were taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headdresses from time to time, and helped us fix them as soon as there was anything wrong.
The photographer is also very funny, and feels very happy after a day of taking pictures.
I saw a lot of cases online and didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, we really didn't mean to add any photos. We directly chose the 24 photos in the set meal, and none of them were added. (I heard that my cousin who took the wedding photos at about the same time added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000-yuan set meal. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many.)
The photos were fixed today and Lalan sent them to me. I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right, so they fixed them for me right away.
English:
I highly recommend that you go to Mrs. Jin's studio to take your wedding photos!
The price of the set is 3999 yuan.
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!
How much does this set cost?
English:
That's fine, no need for a refund.
Your rider says he can't find it.
I can't find it.

Over 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have yet to be registered as their birth certificates cannot be issued due to a shortage of anti-counterfeit paper.
The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of special anti-counterfeit paper has been used up, birth certificates cannot be issued to newborns since early October, and the cumulative number of those affected has reached 3,200.
Although the head of the bureau, Kaalumius, has guaranteed that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, the anti-counterfeiting paper will be reissued next week when it arrives.
He explained at a press conference in response to a report from a web media that Sabah paper had been printed for 10 months.
He said that the relevant issues had arisen 2 months ago, and that Sarawak was also facing the same issues.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-counterfeiting paper is affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah is different from that in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other state-owned stocks.
English:
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately to enter the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take 2 more working days (December 20) to hand it over to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local police station to pick up the registration form.
So far this year, a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah.
I've been waiting since around 7.
Is that almost there?
I'm talking about food.

People's Daily commentator: "The good start of the 14th Five-Year Plan" - on the study and implementation of the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference-Xinhua News Agency
The article "A Good Start to the '14th Five-Year Plan' - Learning and Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference" by a People's Daily commentator on December 12 said:
The "Good Start of the '14-5' Plan" was highly praised at the Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8 to 10, which assessed the achievements of China's economic and social development over the past year.
General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the meeting, deeply summarizing the economic work in 2021 and deeply analyzing the current economic situation, making major deployments for the economic work in 2022, and providing a fundamental guidance for us to do a good job next year in preparation for the successful convening of the Party's 20th National Congress.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China and formally announce the complete building of a moderately prosperous society and the achievement of the first century-long goal, opening a new journey towards the second century-long goal of building a socialist modernized country.
We held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee to sum up the Party's great achievements and historical experience in its hundred-year struggle, and passed the Resolution of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on the Great Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Hundred-Year Struggle, the third historical resolution in the history of the Communist Party of China. This is a political declaration of the Communist Party of China in the new era to remember its original mission, adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for looking to history for guidance, creating the future and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
For the past year, the world has been facing unprecedented changes and the global outbreak of COVID-19, with the external environment becoming more complicated and severe. The tasks of COVID-19 prevention and control and economic and social development at home are extremely heavy.
The Communist Party of China Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, adheres to the general principle of maintaining stability while seeking progress in its work, calmly responds to the challenges of a century of change and a global pandemic, coordinates epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, accelerates the construction of a new development pattern, strengthens macroeconomic policymaking across cycles, and strives to promote sustainable and healthy economic development, deepen reform and opening up, and resolutely achieve the great tasks of reform and development. As a result, the Party and the state have achieved new and significant successes in all areas.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" has started off well, with new progress made in constructing a new development pattern and high-quality development yielding new results.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain global leading positions, and the characteristics of strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum continue to be manifested; the national strategic scientific and technological strength accelerates its growth, and major innovative results emerge in succession, the ability to innovate science and technology continues to be enhanced, and new breakthroughs are made in key and core technologies; the resilience of the industrial chain is enhanced, the volume and quality of foreign trade increases, the structure continues to be optimized, and new kinetic energy represented by new industries, new business formats, and new models grows and expands; reform and opening up are deepened, and efforts are made to break through the bottlenecks that restrict the supply and demand and the flow of factors, and to create new advantages in cooperation and competition with high-level opening up to the outside world; people's livelihood is guaranteed in an effective manner, the scale of employment continues to expand, the growth of residents' incomes is basically synchronized with economic growth, and grain production has remained above 13 billion metric tons for seven consecutive years, reaping the "eighteen consecutive bumper harvests"; ecological civilization construction is continuously advanced, the carbon peak and carbon neutrality work is coordinated and promoted, the pace of green and low-carbon transformation is steady and robust, and new achievements have been made in ecological environment protection.
These results were achieved under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and are the result of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. They are also the result of the concerted efforts of the whole Party, the whole country and all ethnic groups.
Practice has once again proved that it is of decisive significance to the development of the Party and the state cause, and the progress of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, for the Party to establish Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the whole Party, and to establish Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding ideology.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Communist Party Central Committee and the whole Party, with the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and with the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups united as one and fighting tenaciously, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and create a new era of glory and achieve new historic achievements in the new journey of building a modern socialist country.
The Party will convene its Twentieth National Congress next year--a major event in the political life of the Party and the state.
We will carry forward the great spirit of the Communist Party, adhere to the general tone of stability, progress, and seek progress while maintaining stability, implement the new development concept comprehensively, accurately and comprehensively, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepen reform and opening up, adhere to innovation-driven development, promote high-quality development, and adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line. We will coordinate epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, and coordinate development and security. We will continue to do a good job of "six stability" and "six guarantees", and continue to improve people's livelihood. We will focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, keeping the economy running within a reasonable range, and maintaining social stability. We will be able to maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a peaceful and stable social environment, and a clean and upright political environment, and meet the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China with outstanding results.
Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, enhance our "four consciousnesses", remain firm in our "four confidences", and achieve our "two maintenances". We must constantly improve our political judgement, political understanding, and political execution, and take concrete actions to implement the Party Central Committee's decisions and push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test result, with a "buffer period" in place.
The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia at port cities, requiring that people leaving port cities on the mainland (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) in the near future must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and people arriving at port cities on the mainland must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date each province or region determines the port city range and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
English:
The head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some border cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the two sides of the border are frequent.
The policy of differentiated management of partitions should be implemented, and the prevention and control line against spillover should be changed from one line to two lines, so as to realize the front-end movement of the port and compress the risk of spillover of the epidemic, so as to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several outbreaks of locally transmitted epidemics in China, all of which have been imported through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic monitoring and early warning not timely, high-risk positions personnel closed-loop management not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing in the form of cold chain items in each link not in place, centralized isolation management not standardized, epidemic emergency not scientific and precise enough.
The notice requires efforts in nine aspects, including perfecting the mechanism of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, so as to speed up filling the gaps and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation and scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that cities at all ports should synchronize their research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicize and smooth out the hotline for the protection of people's livelihood, regularly investigate and eliminate potential risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the cities mentioned include those where land, water and air ports are open, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and directly-administered cities where they are located. The specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

The video on Youtube reveals the truth about the American military's 20 year history of bloodshed and slaughter.
The video is from YouTube.
December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform caused widespread concern.
This film tells the story of the United States' "war on terror" in Afghanistan, where it forced its version of democracy on the country through military means. For 20 years, the US military has been characterized by its brutality, bloodlust, and indiscriminate killings of innocent people, committing various crimes against humanity in the process.
Abusing drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian places, twisting human nature, and setting up a killing group.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
The more atrocities committed against humanity by the Taliban, the more Afghans hate them.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "getting more and more terrorizing."
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth about America's bloody war in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article by chance and would like to discuss from a commercial and storage perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to can the goods, even though canning is a deep processing and does not fall within the scope of business of a bonded logistics company. Maybe the following text can explain why the customer wants to do this?
I've been to many baby formula factories and seen many production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and bottled milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all.
So everyone must be wondering: why is the shelf life of packaged products one year, while the shelf life of products in cans is two years or longer?
English:
Actually, from this point of departure, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is the best.
Some consumers say that the taste or flavor of the food is different after eating it!
The reason why bespoke audio is expensive is because of the quality. Where is the quality?
English:
Most manufacturers consider pricing when setting prices. If the price of a bag is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low or there is no profit. How can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a big increase in the pricing of their listening devices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers push for listening to装, instead of袋装.
There are so many factories that spend millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So as society develops and market promotion costs like mall salespeople, mall display costs, product promotional costs, advertising costs, etc. continue to increase.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they're listening devices, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact, their raw material costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
Some brands will go to any lengths to promote their products, including bribing hospital doctors to help them market their products. They make anywhere from 30 to 80 yuan in profit from each sale.
English:
It is suggested that, on the premise of having a can at home, powdered milk be bought in bags and be stored in the can, so as to save money, while increasing the shelf life and sealing of powdered milk, with no adverse effects on children.
Don't think that the shelf life of a canned product is longer than that of a bagged product. If the shelf life of a canned product is the same as that of a bagged product after opening, it is only said that it is not easy to store and easy to get damp and deteriorate.
The food delivery was late and the food was cold. The food was cold and dry, and it was completely inedible.

I completely cannot accept this.

Avoid it happening again.
I would like to know the exact time of delivery.
That time is constantly being delayed.
I don't know when to wait.
If I cancel my order, can I get a refund?

I don't want to wait any longer.
Don't startle people at the starting line.
When strolling through a book market, one often gets a sense of the popularity of books on success.
The success books of today often promote "the best principle"--that is, assuming or implying that you can "achieve" first, and then telling you what you need to do to achieve it.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental part of "how to do it."
These books all have one common characteristic - either they try their best and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" is something that anyone would recognize as "absolutely correct," but 99% of people are scared off before they even start.
This theory advocates a "you need to grit your teeth, start over, and make a complete 180" approach, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow tradition, and refuse to change, you just have to shout "you need to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to a cow.
Most people are timid in the face of the word "change", and they are reluctant to take the first step. They either make a sudden decision to change, or they bravely take the first step, but they often don't last long.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people "sigh at the door."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that could lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful path.
The "next best principle" is all about "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a "small win theory" where if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always better than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because it's still better than standing still.
In short, it is always better to do something than to do nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for more ordinary people to stick to it, and as long as they persist, the success rate will also increase.
Just following the "second best principle" the road to success is a little longer.
In short, the "best principle" may motivate more people effectively and benefit more people than the "second best principle" does, even though the "best principle" purports to be for the success of everyone.

The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year.
The latest monitoring results show that the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the initial protection in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, also known as the "Jiangyu", is a precious fish species unique to the Qinghai Lake. It plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as large-scale artificial slaughter and the deteriorating environment of naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
The Qiangtang Lake naked carp was listed as a endangered species in the 2004 edition of the Chinese Species Red List.
Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of banning fishing in order to protect the fish population. No units, collectives, or individuals are allowed to fish in Qinghai Lake or its major tributaries. The sale of naked carp and products made from them is also banned.
At the same time, through artificial reproduction and release, as well as cleaning up the main rivers and channels entering Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, the protection of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources is continuously increased, and the reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources are increasing year by year.
8 billion naked carp have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake so far, accounting for more than 23% of the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the eastward expansion of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued announcements on the key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag. It was cold outside.

We only saw one bag.
I wonder if it was a mistake or if someone took it on purpose. Thank you.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't arrived.
I just saw an article about taking sick days off, it's too long.
English:
Most girls will experience their first period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and will reach menopause around the age of 50.
After that, as long as the body is healthy, it will come once a month.
English:
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people have them for three days, some for a week. Some people have little bleeding, some have heavy bleeding. Some people have no reaction, some people are in so much pain that they have to be taken away by ambulance. Menstrual cramps change over time, so just because you didn't have them before doesn't mean you never will.
English:
Menstrual pain is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve pain in the month, but it is useless to take it after the menstrual period begins.
English:
If you're around the time of your period, have a sudden stomachache, and your period comes within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria will easily grow. excluding sleep time, the worst case is that they are changed six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pieces. If we add the number of pads prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one per month.
You don't need to change your sanitary pads very often. You can change them every five or six hours, or up to eight hours if necessary.
English:
Although official crime data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and would not use emotional problems as an excuse,
Not only blood flows, but also the endometrium that is shed from the uterus.
The endometrium is thinnest after menstruation and gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, build a house (endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If guests don't come, demolish it all (menstruation discharge) and build a new house next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades, a few days 24 hours of bleeding each month, but also abdominal pain, back pain, who would like?
English:
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting, and finds that the preparation that women's bodies make for bearing life is disgusting, they shouldn't say so in public. Girls, stand up, don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in their lifetime, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can you face your own mother with this attitude, and how can you want your own children?
English:
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and it's disappointing to get the wrong gift.
You will need to order a separate meal for your child.
I hope the store will check the products in the midst of its busyness.
Is it safe to have an electric foot bath if the basin is leaking?
English:
As people's awareness of health care increases, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers and a large number of products with different grades appear on the market, from 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. This gives consumers a great deal of choice.
On relevant data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health-care home appliances such as foot baths are booming, but there are no industry-specific standards for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father's birthday present, but his father felt numb when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that when he turned off the vibration function, his father would still feel the tingling at the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and found that it was bright. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
English:
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on aspects such as the temperature setting of this long-popular foot bath, who it is suitable for, and what materials are safe to use.
However, in general, the bathtub is not electrically charged, but it does not exclude that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a freestanding bathtub when purchasing.
There is no safety hazard in separating water and electricity.
You can also take the electric pen at will.
The 13th Hunan Tea Expo opens - Headlines from Shidian - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Innovation Tea Technology and Culture Promotion Conference was held today morning at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.

The tea industry in the province is increasing its innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns in the forefront, and the main tea-producing areas promoting the integration of tea and travel, driving increased income for tea farmers.
The wind and the water take turns, and the red tea is gaining strength.
Experts in the provincial tea industry say that after picking green tea, picking black tea, and tea farmers have income all year round, the value of tea gardens is rising.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Tea".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant found a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhungao, said with great joy that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
A touch of red in Newhua tea, infused with the connotation of tea culture, popular and transaction-fired, Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided over the past 30-plus years since our relatives passed away. In particular, I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends both domestically and internationally in 1994, and this assistance has continued uninterrupted to the present day.
Most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families of their own.
Your kind act helped us families in need get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is raging globally, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop giving humanitarian aid to the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have ended long ago.
I will forever remember your love, and I firmly believe that your actions will be remembered by history.
English:
Please accept my sincere blessings.
I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the IFCSS and MCDF's humanitarian relief efforts over the past 32 years.
In the course of humanitarian relief, the American Association for Chinese Students and Scholars and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers often overlap.
The Apple Daily newspaper reported that the Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.
Aid money often cannot reach the hands of those affected by the six-four incident smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", which was executed for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor and Elderly Assistance Fund" and has been executing it to this day.
These projects are mainly funded by donations from campuses and society in 1989, from individuals' generous donations, and by the support of the Foundation for Democracy in Universities and Colleges.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years later, that the families of Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donation that was raised in Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen Square.
During this time, China Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for a stop to the June 4th donations because he was considering the donors, who are mostly retired and not as well-off as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the relevant parties and terminate the project within two years, and resume it immediately if necessary.

Thank you for the feedback, Rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of power to continue, we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no perfect.
The makeup artist is very delicate and can match the makeup suitable for you according to your style. The makeup products are also top-notch brands.
Teacher Tian Liang is even more professional in photography.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require a six-month waiting list. A colleague of ours had their photos taken there, and after seeing the finished product, we thought it was just so-so.
I specially sought out this studio - a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we feel that this is also the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will take pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
English:
English:
I've already recommended my BFF and she just saw the pictures and loved them.
I hope that studios like this don't get buried and that more people discover them so that they can shoot in their own style instead of all looking the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Zhenying and Jingling. Both of them are very creative newbies. We are a creative studio. As long as the customers like us, we will try our best to finish it. Thank you for the acquaintance.
The sweet and caring assistant, the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, and every member of the team are all super nice. It's a wonderful shoot and a unforgettable experience. And the effect of the shooting is much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work.
Thank you for your comment, Xiaoyu. It's destiny that we met each other. We trust each other even though we're thousands of kilometers apart, from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao. I'm happy to know you. I hope to have a chance to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.
How do I give money?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you're planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money for training is very much, and you have to use 6 months to learn.
If you're planning on getting into this industry, training is definitely a very good choice, especially for those who are self-disciplined and weak. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
The first thing you need to look at is the strength of the faculty at the institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is not worth it. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculties.
It's best to ask around about this training institution before making a choice, and see if you can find out anything about the students who have graduated from there. After all, only the students of the institution would know how good or bad it is, and how good the courses are.
Hello, I'm actually not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given a definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this stuff has a lot to do with the individual's own situation.
For example, your major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you're in can all be related to the field you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, I personally suggest self-study if time permits. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large. Basically, it takes 3-6 months to concentrate on training.
English:
There are also some classic books that can be integrated with video learning.
If you're not majoring in computer science but are willing to pay for tuition and dedicate time to learning, it's recommended that you attend a training institution. The classes are less strenuous and the teachers are more thorough with their explanations. There are also people available to answer questions. In addition, the institution can help with planning and supervision.
Many training institutions now sign employment agreements with internal recommendations and recommendations after learning, which can save a lot of time in the later job interview.
These are my thoughts. I can't give you a detailed answer because I don't know your situation. If you have other questions, feel free to contact me.
I said I would be there an hour ago, and I saw it in the app.
What does it mean when someone says "什么叫"?
I'm not done yet. What are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boiler water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional grouting, and homekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently liked me, worked hard for a living, life is tired but continue.
Life won't let down those who work hard. Follow me if you like. Thank those who silently like me.
Life is like this. Others only see the results, but we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we can only be strong and continue. There is no other choice. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job, but it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude, see the satisfied smile and thumb of the customer, that moment all the fatigue is worth it, and the pay will be returned!
My daily work
Your request is my command.

English:
My daily work is cleaning inside and outside the house.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will also become dull and lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Do it with your heart and you will be successful; do it with meticulous care and you will create something exquisite; we take pride in our work.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself. Professionalism is worth trusting. Your approval is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to make a living in any industry nowadays!
I always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, I can persist and work hard, and I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The day begins with the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you take happiness, luck, health and good luck with you. Start a new day and keep a good mood all day. Good morning.
When we are young, happiness is something we have; when we grow up, happiness is something we strive for; when we mature, we realize that happiness is a state of mind.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; life's two treasures: good health and good mood, live brightly and happily until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, it is not your ability that restrains you, but your courage to face it actively.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it bravely.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face them head-on, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennial, jointly organized by Chinese and Saudi curators, was held in Saudi Arabia.
The first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennale - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale - officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Dhahran Biennial Foundation and China's UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, Director of China's UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, serving as Artistic Director.
The theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The Biennial covers nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Towards the Public", "The Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
More than 40% of the exhibits are from Saudi artists, including paintings, installations, and performance art. 12 Chinese artists are also receiving attention, with some using recycled materials in innovative ways. For example, in Xu Bing's "The Endless Mountain" (2014), he reconstructs a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
The CEO of the Diriya Biennial Foundation, Mr. Barkley, said that he hoped that this Biennial could establish an international dialogue, so that the global audience could have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen mutual exchanges.
Tian Fei Yu said: "The Biennial's goal is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to engage with the contemporary art world."
According to reports, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Regulating and Standardizing the Management of Rural Public Welfare Positions - Xinhua Net
The Yunnan Provincial Government has recently issued policies to promote the revitalization of rural areas by managing public welfare positions in rural areas, so as to help advance rural revitalization comprehensively.
The responsible person from the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken laborers, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people achieve employment and income, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively promoting rural public service capabilities.
The new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Department of Rural Revitalization, and the Department of Finance, mainly for the purpose of unifying the scope of objects, fund management, position development, and position management for grassroots recruitment of personnel for rural public welfare positions.
In terms of position development settings, the new regulations clearly state that they will be set according to the principles of "position development as needed, personnel determined by position, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
The new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments in charge of the development of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare positions.

Can I cancel my order?

Although the right-wing has had successful periods throughout history, they have not been long-lived, so their shortness is because they need only a little sunlight to flourish, and only a little water to sweat; if they are slightly successful, they will be able to see all the way to Sichuan, but if they are met with defeat, they will be forced to join the ranks of the Maoists.
But to be realistic, the right wing has played a positive role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of setting the standards of truth at the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, promoting technological advancement, and pushing for institutionalization and the protection of human rights.
I don't agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, but I pay attention to what he says and respect him as a person. He is sincere and takes Chinese society and its problems seriously.
I disagree with his anti-communist theory; I think that an unnecessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage the people's livelihood, and plunge the political arena into a mire of infighting and foreign intervention.
Change or improve China must have the patience and be responsible for the country and the people's attitude, political opportunists in the fire to get the chestnut, that is not the right-wing, is a scoundrel.
Let's talk about it again.
The left is actually a group of political and social outcasts.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some of the right's comments and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not be able to do this, because the left is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Recently, I saw some friends scolding the rebels while refuting Zuodan, and they were quite angry. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't even try to reason with traitors or leftists - they're both incorrigible and unreasonable.
English:
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you a five-mao, when the Leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people also have ideals in their youth, but they forget their ideals or pursue their ideals after they grow old, and become obsessed with them.
English:
I think that "left" and "right" generally refer to restraint and freedom, and that China's overall orientation should be left-wing due to its historical and cultural heritage.
Right-wingers in China emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers prioritize fairness and security.
The current social climate overall is one of wanting more focus on fairness, while the rivalry between China and the US leans more towards the latter, which is likely to continue for many years.
Although I can't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up.
English:
The blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips by the United States in recent years has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American system" companies.
The United States is suppressing China's semiconductor industry and requiring its own companies and allied countries to block China's semiconductor industry at the same time, which directly leads to the global semiconductor suppliers' orders and profits being affected, resulting in reduced research and development investment and capacity of semiconductor manufacturers, and thus causing a shortage of semiconductor supply chains globally.
Now that the "core shortage" has affected all major industries globally, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the rise in mobile phone prices, almost all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to gain control over "chips", an increasing number of countries' technology giants are beginning to move towards "de-Americanization."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been taking action frequently recently. First, it presided over the "Chip Summit"; then it invited 64 country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and provided funds to support US domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the field of chips, Intel, a old-brand technology giant in the United States, invested US$20 billion to build two wafer fabrication plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
English:
The reason for this is that Intel, as a veteran American technology giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
English:
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April, Zhang Zhongmou was amazing. He had no scruples about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory. He directly said that Intel's investment in building a chip foundry was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's entry into the semiconductor field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still resentful of a grudge against Intel from more than 30 years ago.
English:
In the 1980s, the world's top semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this pattern has put some small businesses under too much strain, and many semiconductor startups have had to back down in the face of the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that if there was a company specializing in design, he could set up a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
English:
TSMC targets its main business at the "wafer fabrication" single link, providing only foundry services without design.
At the time, TSMC had just been founded and was a small fry compared to Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once looked for Intel's investment, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously somewhat proud and looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel at that time did not look down on wafer fabrication services.
I never thought that the giants who looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services in those days would now have to start outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into foundry was ironic.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
Facing TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally dare not stay where it is.
Nowadays, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
I'm not going to wait any longer.
I placed my order at 19:06, 2 hours ago.
Today let's take a look at some [strange hot searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Three random hot searches: February 2nd Dragon raises its head, Haolai You prices rise, Huolala incident, public opinion diffusion forms a peak, and then [the index declines] (smoothing curve) finally disappears. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump again.
They look exactly like the "evolution of public opinion on the internet" model exhibited by the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a "peak", a "sawtooth", or a "cliff".
English:
In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is within seconds. It must be that the unified batch of water soldiers received the task and started a new round of attack.
The professionalization of the black public relations industry is evident from the dozens of hot searches that appear on the list at the same time. Which of these searches attracts attention, which is responsible for popular science, which incites hostility, which diverts attention, which influences cognition, which misleads judgment, which stirs emotions, and which wraps up decision-making? The black industry accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuning operations, taking into account almost all the elements of public opinion diffusion.
Propaganda is a science, and if you set aside all subjective factors like position and emotion, there's nowhere for it to hide when you look at the objective data.
English:
The data comes from the Hot Search Time Machine.

Three new variants of the coronavirus have been found in Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi.
Mauritius reports its first two cases of the Aumihkoron virus.
According to Minister of Health, Kailash Jagutpal, one of the infected is a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th; the other is a local Mauritian who tested positive for the virus on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
English:
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of infection with the Aumichrong strain for the first time.
These three people are students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. Because they are all mild, they were not hospitalized.
The government is stepping up its efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.
From December 6 to January 10, all passengers aged 12 and over who fly into the country will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
The Malawian Minister of Health, Mr. Kumbuzo Chimpanda, announced on the 9th that the country had discovered 3 cases of infection with the new coronavirus strain known as the "Omikron" strain.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 new coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three infected cases.

DaMei 360 integrates home decoration.
Address: 12th floor, 156 South Ring Road, Happiness Community
I was introduced to this company by a friend, and I chose to come here because I trust them. I originally budgeted 70,000 RMB for a basic renovation.
They start a series of scams as soon as they come into the store.
I came to the store for the first time and showed them my floor plan. They didn't measure the house on site. They were able to give me a quote for my 135 square meter house for 70,000 yuan. They showed me their materials, but I don't know what brand they are.
They will try to trick you into paying a deposit as soon as you walk into the store (and you will never be able to get this money back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
I was hesitating about whether or not to pay the deposit, and they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you could get today if you paid the deposit.
This is a big scam, and I am a living example of someone who was cheated. I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I was impulsive.
His quote to me had a lot of problems - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom - these three are the biggest expenses for a basic renovation.
Their service fees are also higher than other companies' when you take away these.
I lost trust in this company when they had me sign a contract without explaining anything first.
English:
No matter how, it is the customer's problem that they will bite to death, and they are entirely blameless.
There are many details involved in their shirking of responsibility, and I don't want to go into them all--suffice it to say, don't choose them. My friend who had them renovate her house also had poor quality work, and they ended up charging her all sorts of fees.
English:
So don't choose such a shitty decoration company.
In the future, everyone should consult with others and do their research before making any decisions because renovating is not a small task.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to post merchant reviews of any kind. For details, please see the merchant's inclusion statement.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest business information such as the address, phone number and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration, so that you can find the decoration company and decoration company.

The Starry Sky Has a Date | Gemini Meteor Shower Will Peak on the 14th - Xinhua
The Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere and the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, will peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomical enthusiasts took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the Gemini meteor shower is caused by 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is the second known meteor shower not "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council member and astronomical science popularization expert Xiu Lijie introduced that, like the New Year's blockbuster films, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year, with the "release date" lasting from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Geminid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
The significant feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow in speed and rich in color, and there are also many fireballs. It is suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners to take pictures.
Tianjin City astronomical enthusiast Yang Jing took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiation point directly overhead) of 150.
The Twins Meteor Shower is best seen in the Southern Hemisphere.
Last year, the "spectacular" Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered with by moonlight, and the degree of excitement will be discounted.
The 14th is the 11th day of the lunar month, the phase of the moon is full, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
English: "Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but they need to be careful to stay warm."
How can you see the most meteors?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude, less light pollution, facing the northeast direction of the field of view, and then patiently wait for the moon to fall, you can observe it with the naked eye.
You don't need to stare at the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower the whole time you're observing it; the meteor shower has a large flow in all directions.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower' scene, using high ISO and the largest aperture.
Based on the consideration of stability and continuity, tripod, spare batteries and shutter line are also indispensable.
Peng Xiuli reminds us that.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, while the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning is mainly reflected in the following two aspects:
Lasers focus on the big-screen market.
Laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market than LCD TVs, or laser TVs are products born for large screens.
The mainstream size of LCD TVs is from 55 to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, laser TV shipments and sales have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of overall TV sales of 80 inches or more.
According to Zhiyi Health's forecast, in 2020, laser TV sales will grow by more than 140%, continuing to grow rapidly.
The reason for the great success in the big-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
The imaging principle of laser television is based on the reflection of light from a laser television. The light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronics Standardization Institute's Saixi Laboratory and ophthalmology experts from Beijing Union Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for 144 groups of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye-protection properties and can even improve vision in certain ways.
With vision health becoming increasingly valued, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye-protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Lasers TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
English:
English:
It makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TV has many advantages that liquid crystal TV and projection cannot achieve.
Laser TVs use short-throw projection technology to project a 100-inch image at a shorter distance than traditional projection equipment, making them more space-efficient and requiring less equipment.
English:
English:
In addition to this, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen, etc., which can bring users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It's not that laser TVs are a sham, but rather a product of over-specification. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, they're not for audio-visual enthusiasts. If you want to watch in a large screen and have a good viewing environment, you can try it out. Everything has its pros and cons, so weigh them out and make your own decision. The last thing you want is to be swayed by one-sided opinions.
In simple terms, the ultra-wide angle close-focus projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, have to use the expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflector, which does not comply with the best optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fiehler screens is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically enough to change a 65-inch LCD.
I really hate it when projection manufacturers try to sell diffuse reflection as being good for your eyes. Come on, the light from the screen that your eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it onto the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffuse. When you turn on the TV, doesn't the ceiling also get lit up?
And also, if the projection screen cloth is not diffuse reflection, it can't become like that.
The hot spots (light spots) on the high-gain screen are precisely what are ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

After I arrived and chatted with my sister about my ideas, she patiently helped me try on two outfits that I was undecided about. We finally decided on a makeup style and started taking pictures. The photographer would arrange props and guide our poses before taking pictures, and he was also very detail-oriented.
However, because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style of the shoot didn't turn out the way I wanted it to, but it should be good-looking.
English:
It will take about half a month to fix the film, so wait for the results.
I won the "Bawang Can" photo shoot activity for the second time ~ most of the clothes can be chosen for shooting.
I chose a black chiffon dress in the end to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer who is responsible for the shooting is the younger brother of 95. I feel a little bit green. I hope I can give more suggestions on customer shooting action guidance in the future. He is very talkative and the shooting process is pleasant.
English:
Come check out Queenie too now that you're on the home page!
First, fill out your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose your clothes. You can choose your wedding dress here, and they're patient even when you try on 3 or 4 outfits. After you've chosen your outfit, they'll do your makeup, which takes a long time. The staff is friendly and they'll teach you how to pose later on, but the edited photos make your face look really big. They said the final product will take half a month to be ready, but I got it in just 3 or 4 days and it doesn't look much different from the original.
The environment is not bad.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup locations, one of which is inside the photography studio.
The service is very friendly and also very attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements seriously.

English:
I also shaved my eyebrows, which is a bit awkward since I don't usually wear makeup.
I gave the photos ten days, but I'm not very satisfied with the Photoshop effects; it's still very obvious that there's double eyelid tape on them.
I wasn't quite sure what style I wanted, so I tried on two sets. In the end, I chose the black dress because it was more Audrey Hepburn-esque.
English:
The photographer started taking pictures after I did my makeup and hair. The photographer directed me the whole time on how to pose. It was a very easy and harmonious process.
English:
It's been 3 days and I haven't received a response...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can I be exempt from the monthly fee until you finish your investigation, is that okay?

To be an insurance broker company, according to the "Insurance Brokerage Regulatory Regulations (amended in 2015)", it must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no major violations in the past 3 years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite strict. In summary, the company must be qualified, approved by the state authority (regulates all insurance companies and banks in China), and have good shareholder behavior. As an insurance broker, Xiaoyusan Insurance, policyholders don't need to question too much whether Xiaoyusan Insurance is legitimate or not. After all, with these three thresholds, not every insurance company can reach them.
So far, so good. It's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest HeTai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claim side and the insurer are both HeTai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary. There is no need to doubt its reliability.
Internet products generally have a higher cost-performance ratio because they don't have the overhead costs of running brick-and-mortar businesses or paying sales staff. They also have flexible payment options, including monthly payments, which can ease the burden on policyholders while maximizing the insurance industry's leverage.
This is still very good.
Perhaps.
It is especially important to consider the professionalism of the insurance salesperson, because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In the areas of health notification and occupation, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective consciousness when they insure, thinking that they are healthy or qualified, which can easily lead to many hidden risks of claims and the risk of being rejected.
I have worked as an insurance salesperson on "Tencent Micro Insurance" (an internet insurance brokerage platform, just like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible in telling everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and credible, but it is not credible that people are professional and have many sales misleading.
For example, if you buy insurance for 1 yuan, you will be insured for 6 million yuan. If you buy insurance, you will be given a mobile phone for free. You will be given 60,000 yuan for critical illness insurance. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are avoiding the heavy and the light. They will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is the normal fee, which is dozens to 200. Many customers don't know what they are paying for after a year or two.
English:
Free cell phone, is the policy number such as 6666, 8888 this special policy number only sent, and if the winning text message is sent out, no one reminds themselves not to exchange.
This is another trap for the policyholder. They offer a free 6-million-yuan critical illness insurance policy, but it's only temporary. If you only rely on this and don't have any other commercial insurance, and you really get a critical illness, 6 million yuan won't be enough to solve the problem. You'll be left to fend for yourself in the future.
The state is also cracking down on the false advertising of internet insurance sales.
So in conclusion, the platform is not the problem, the product is not the problem, the problem is the salesperson's professionalism and professional ethics.
I would suggest that the questioner consider carefully, in fact many offline insurance broker companies have more products, customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have better cost-performance ratios than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers by myself, and have provided them with offline products, which saves them 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am an insurance broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience. I have served nearly a thousand corporate customers and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor the insurance products for the customer. During the insurance, I will compare the three insurance companies for the customer and try my best to get the best underwriting results for the customer. After insurance, I will help the customer sort out and deposit the insurance policy, so that the customer can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
Internet insurance is an insurance business that allows policyholders to complete all insurance procedures independently by clicking on an insurance link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although there is no "ceremony" in the insurance of the Internet, and even the paper version of the contract may not be printed, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit like "telephone sales" in that it's a assembly line operation, but there is a fatal flaw with buying insurance this way - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for several decades. When we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we have chosen is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and also provide us with services in many years to come?

In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If we don't take into account political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
I have been ignoring your requests to be friends on Facebook and your posts that are meant to be jokes since you started them. Now you are trying to post my home address and father's name on social media.
After you stopped messaging me incessantly throughout the day, you continued to post humiliating comments about me on Facebook to your so-called friends. I don't care anymore.

I said that you wouldn't believe me, but you didn't.
I don't think any girl who's been bullied like that could say she's okay.
Only those who lack basic moral character would choose to harm any woman in this way, whether in the workplace, in society, in politics, or in business.

The Yangtze River mainstream achieves full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area.
The Chongqing Fuling Waterfront Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation on December 11, according to a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan. This is the second Waterfront Green Comprehensive Service Zone to be officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the operation of the Luzhou Waterfront Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan Province on December 8.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The Vice Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation, Qiu Jianhua, stated that prior to this, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already established 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River which had been widely recognized by sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the ability of the Yangtze River vessel pollution receiving and shipping service has been significantly improved.
According to reports, the Waterfront Green Service Area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and sailors, and helping sailors solve the "desperate and expectant" problem.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas that have been built and are now in operation along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services, and government services, with a focus on green environmental protection and featuring ship repair and ship emergency rescue services. This will enable sailors who are sailing on the Yangtze River all year round to work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China according to the latest satellite images. American media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending a strong message to both allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform", on January 9, a satellite found the US aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" near the Balabac Strait.
The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait connects the South China Sea and the Gulf of Sulu and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the "Carl Vinson" has deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
There is the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson carrier currently sailing in the upper Pacific.
The USS Lincoln also carried an F-35C squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the "Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan) carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile destroyer "Shangpu Lake" and the missile frigate "Stoke Dale".
The US has three aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Aircraft Carriers Gather around China, the Most Powerful Weapon Rarely Visits Guam on January 17, 2022. CMV-22B transport aircraft flying route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal paid an rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada", carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Guam naval base last Saturday (January 15).
The US is sending a signal to its allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation around China with the rare visit of its three aircraft carriers to Guam in the Western Pacific.
This is the first time that an American ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and only the second time that one has visited the island openly since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China's periphery. The strongest weapon is making a rare visit to Guam. China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongxu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
The United States Navy stated that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's recent visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, showed the United States' capability, flexibility, readiness, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
English:
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rumbling" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept secret.
The secrets surrounding the ballistic missile submarine, the "Boomer", make it the "most important survivable weapon" in the nuclear triad, which also includes land-based ballistic missiles in silos in the United States, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
I was talking to a friend about how Meta's stock has fallen 26% recently and how it has lost $251 billion in market value. Zuckerberg responded to this by saying that they are "facing unprecedented competition." Why do you think this is?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is an advertising company that generates revenue primarily from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., regardless of the functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many Apps external Meta advertising, advertising platform Meta is to achieve realization.
But times have changed.
Because of the adjustment to Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
English:
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
The weakening of the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist)
Meta is not operational in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, primarily from Chinese companies doing maritime business.
We have around a hundred employees in our Hong Kong office, and several major distributors in Mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent goes to Meta.
It's interesting to note that Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta was able to make a lot of money off of Byte just a couple of years ago.
Various domestic agents are helping bytes to Meta for advertising, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
Chinese companies have gone through a stage of burning money on a large scale overseas.
The third reason is that the expansion of new traffic channels is not going well.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms like TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but also on future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "the original universe."
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the Metaverse has a longer implementation cycle, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a tough period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, it's very prosperous, and it also has an annual income of 10 to 20 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook now feels very crisis-ridden and has no good moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his social software now has a higher daily activity and is also a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., he is not confident in the face of TikTok's rapid development, and it only takes a blink of an eye to subvert it.
It is impossible to achieve the concept of the universe in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also why Zuckerberg keeps changing the name of the company and looking for new tracks. However, I think his choice of tracks is wrong and is a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.

The "Peace Rescue-2021" medical joint exercise between the Chinese and Vietnamese armies has come to a successful end.
The Chinese delegation participating in the "Peace Rescue-2021" medical joint exercise with the Vietnamese army safely returned to Guangxi, China on the morning of the 12th, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
This joint training exercise focused on humanitarian medical relief, following the mission of medical rescue and treatment, and completed joint medical command, joint on-site rescue, and mass casualty treatment according to standards of practicality, effectively enhancing the medical protection capabilities of the two militaries.
The results of the exercise were affirmed by the armies of both China and Vietnam.
The head of the Vietnamese side of the Joint Committee for the Exercise, Major General Nguyen Huy Sung, who is also the Vice Director of the General Logistics Department and the Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, said at the closing ceremony of the exercise that the Vietnamese medical team had learned from their Chinese counterparts about the organization and professional conduct of the exercise, and had also seen Chinese medical and security equipment.
The results of the exercise have proved the professional ability of the two countries' medical forces in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
Chen Chunming, head of the Chinese side's guiding and coordinating group and deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Logistical Support Department of the Central Military Commission, said that the exercise was another innovative practice based on the successful holding of the joint medical consultation activity in 2018, which was of great milestone significance.
During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, rapid nucleic acid detection instruments and other health epidemic prevention materials to the Vietnamese People's Army.
