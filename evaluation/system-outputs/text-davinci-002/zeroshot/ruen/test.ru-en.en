In my opinion, the literature program was formed by the Balzac women of that time based on their interests.
We prefer Danielson and Volkovsky from Russian literature of the 19th century.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the perspective of those very same ladies of Balzacian age.

The mattress has different levels of firmness on each side: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft surface is a natural latex sheet.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
The model's advantages include breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, ventilates naturally like a coconut shell.
This helps to preserve a healthy microclimate in the bedroom.
Also, the mattress has an extended warranty period.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in practice the mattress lasts longer.
The dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable jacquard cover, which is included in the set.

Germany: A fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in summer or fall of 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccination campaign in Germany is not the final one and will continue with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
Ulrich Wiegel, head of the Association of General Practitioner Physicians, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in summer, at the latest in autumn, - the expert believes.
English:
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
The new variant is especially dangerous.
The likelihood of a recurrent "Omikron" infection is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that at two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 are not enough to protect against infection with the micron-strain.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts are urging for faster vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zaltsberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, as Zaltsberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing in this regard," the expert emphasized.

The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for use in bottom fishing, not just for casting.
These lures have a greater than their close analogues in size, weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top slider made of durable and resilient plastic, creating additional vibration hues when moved vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter vib", Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a quite aggressive game when fishing.
The most sensitive animation is often the simplest monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
The deviation from the vertical axis is not very large when planning, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles that can be hooked.
Additionally, a small deviation is relevant when catching pike and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter when a precise and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Upon reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please her caprices, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
Also noted is that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive catfish, which does not even react to bait.
English:
This lure is understandable and not capricious, goes well with the line and braided lines of even large diameters.
For catching pike, sturgeon, perch or walleye in addition to a uniform "step", sometimes with a "peck" at the bottom.
If you fish in snaggy areas, you can change your treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among its class, the Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most productive.
With the same success can be used on both small and relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

There are 7,000 Russian mercenaries in Libya.
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
On Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Higher State Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Meshri announced.
There are currently more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt), "the agency Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Halef al-Mishri also said that Russian mercenaries are trying to capture the central part of Libya extending from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save the presence.
The publication's interviewee believes that Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to an agency report.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is supported by the Kremlin.
English:
According to the agency, "Wagner" is probably active in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, "Wagner's" subsidiary companies receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as supplies of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, - the article says.
According to the media, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donetsk, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered with any government agencies or in the business registry, and its members are not listed in any formal lists of personnel.
This company is under sanctions by the United States.
We would like to remind you that the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries have previously approved sanctions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Higher State Council of Libya is effectively the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24 at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the elections, and the chances of them happening on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
The Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reports.
The foreign policy of Russians through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
Examples of success - "in Syria we defended, restored peace there", "decision on "Nord stream -2"" ,"we scared the whole world that we have cool weapons", "Crimea we took back".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says the study of the "Public Opinion" Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based operations - all government services have also become digital.
The Dubai government has announced a complete switch from paper-based to digital operations.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
Today marks the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the heir to the throne of the emirate, chairman of the executive council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, both internal and external document circulation in all state institutions in Dubai will only be conducted digitally through special information platforms.
The new initiative has affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. The initiative has also been joined by many commercial organizations.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
The authorities calculated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved during this time, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, has previously stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days per year.

Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the 2020 level.
Production and exports of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
The industry's performance for the 11 months was worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November 115 thousand cars were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than the year before.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
If the automotive sector in Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to the previous year during the first 10 months of this year, then the output of vehicles for the 11 months of 2021 turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this drop was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSCB subjects have been granted a deferral on credit payments in 2021.
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation with providing benefits for small and medium businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
According to the Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in order to implement the instruction of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of April 9, 2021 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Payment Deferrals to Loans of Small and Medium Businesses", - Alihan Smailov wrote in his answer to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the deferral of loan payments provided by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities to subjects of the self-employed, including sole proprietors, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The grace period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's statement could have indicated a different payment deferral period.
English:
For the year 2021, applications for deferral of payments on loans were submitted to second-level banks by 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 subjects of SMEs were granted a deferral on a amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFIs, applications for deferral were submitted by 131 subjects of the SME, of which deferral was granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Dr. Purasev suggested that people with weak immune systems are able to easily carry the "okimon" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the "okmiron" coronavirus strain may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus's inception.
Scientists believe that "okimon" was born in the body of an infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
This means that he didn't encounter any resistance from immunity when he mutated.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
It looks like he has more of these spike proteins, thorns, maybe than he should, their antibodies weren't cut during mutations - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to carry "okimon" more easily than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections when young people in their 30s die, while old people in their 60s just get a cold.
The young man's immune response was absolutely insane; where one could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows - Sergei Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or viruses.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the organism - this is the temperature, weakness, malaise.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid.
The authors of the study examined fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
English:
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from Covid and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Semen Goloshekin, a candidate of biological sciences, has named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Golosheokin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
English:
Also contributing to dementia are harmful habits like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decreased level of abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, - the biologist added.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities requiring involvement of memory and logic to prevent the disease.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts to the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV by Shaaban Abdel Gawad, head inspector of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities' Department of Returning Antiquities.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year in the Museum of the Bible in Washington were 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization found," he said.
Abdel Guaad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
The employees of the department are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon their return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that one of the artifacts returned was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in finding the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
An auction house Christie's on July 4 held an auction, at which a bust more than 3 thousand. Years was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused displeasure on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally smuggled out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god of the sun Amon, was kept in a private collection and not put up for sale since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".

Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the USA, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, but instead offers a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to current rules, the bank is allowed to review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used for conducting business with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, spat with imazhinism, he is himself, but is known, in demand, sometimes severely scolded by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
Over 60 poems were written in the year, many of them masterpieces, the "Persian Motifs" cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Karenina" was written, and 8 books were published, including the collection "Soviet Russia".
The main success was the signing of a contract with Esenin on the publication of his works in three volumes by Gosizdat at the end of June 25.
No contemporary poet has been as honored as Sergey Alexandrovich, he's the first!
This also promised very good money - under the contract, the honorarium was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
We needed the money that year more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and they needed to set up a household, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems like life is going well, there's something to be happy about, but for him everything is primarily in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Mayakovsky's death) has materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind that's whistling?
Over the empty and deserted field,
It's like a forest in September.
Alcohol is rotting your brain.
Many friends noted that Esenin greatly deteriorated, looked bad, was obviously sick.
English:
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
If such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Say, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedaor Duncan, was treated for health in a clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Gannushkin (again Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
There are plenty of accounts of the poet's binges, scandals on this ground, complaints to the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed with his friend, imazhinst Ivan Starcev, for a short time.
It is surprising that despite Esenin's relatively good earnings, he never had his own place in Moscow or St. Petersburg, instead renting apartments, staying in hotels, or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
He would only come to stay the night and in most cases he would be in an incoherent, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and coughed.
English:
Esenin himself, after touring Europe and the United States (there was Prohibition in the States at the time, but Duncan had brought along a decent supply of alcohol), admitted:
I saw nothing there but taverns and streets.
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
English:
I drank because the longing was gnawing at me.

"Not by Senka's hat": when a velvety jacket makes a man a laughing-stock
At the 2021 secular events, velvety jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
English:
After him, Prince William twice followed, who first at the ceremony of awarding the Earthshot Prize donned a green velvet jacket not corresponding to the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic version at an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried on by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress is already seeing increased demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
4 times more people started buying the service, according to analysts at Gazeta.ru.
The most popular warm velvet jackets are with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and of course black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
English:
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented in almost all brands - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is the Gucci, in which one of the ambassadors of the brand Jared Leto came out for the premiere of the movie "Gucci House".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a hairy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but of course, they last less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that with a velvet jacket the main thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoschkin. - It will also be suitable for those cases where the invitation indicates the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to consider when choosing a velvet jacket is the status of the person who will be wearing it.
The authors of the "Gentleman Brammel" Telegram channel believe that a man in a velvet jacket should first of all acquire a proper advanced party with a surplus. People who usually don't buy tickets often own velvet jackets.

The immunologist said that vaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the coronavirus strain "omicron."
The vaccination can protect against the new strain of coronavirus "omicron" within four to five months.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period."
"In the past, this time frame was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases - every four," - said the expert, calling for a parallel vaccination campaign to be vaccinated.

If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or they have fallen ill and been vaccinated, or been vaccinated and then fallen ill, then they have received "hybrid immunity", that is, there are many antibodies and they are sufficiently neutralizing," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "major consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.

It is emphasized in the document that "Russia's military aggression" against Ukraine "will have far-reaching consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
We, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.
English:
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, - also said the ministers of foreign affairs of the "Big Seven".
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response", - they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier today, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia will face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed "a united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and who made it very clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have severe consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 32 times less effective against the omicron-strain of coronavirus than against other strains.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant, said Professor Malik Peiris.
Scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course in coronavirus infection.
Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic taking into account the impact of the omicron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine has accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Aleksey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the purchase of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany had put a veto on the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and machine guns to down drones.
It should be noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
The Minister of Defense stated that Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
FT notes that the new German government's position on allowing arms shipments to Ukraine under Chancellor Olaf Scholz remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk stated that Kiev should not expect any arms shipments from Berlin during Chancellor Merkel's visit.
He said that the previous German government had explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalating the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, a diplomat is sure, Germany will preserve and with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenskiy said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in outfitting the navy.

Ways to get stolen money back from online stores are revealed.
There are a few ways to get your money back if you've been scammed by an online store, and to avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
Their exposure was revealed by experts in information security in a conversation with RBK.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when your bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
A portion of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts recommend also opening a separate card for purchases online.
If money was stolen while shopping at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility lies with the participant in the payments chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
An Ecommpay expert has stated that a customer has the right to file a claim with their bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
If the perpetrator used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the funds to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
She believes that an effective solution in the current situation could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the border with Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline.
Although Schroeder declared his intention to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, has stated that he will be calling on Schultz to speak out against the "North Stream-2" pipeline, which is intended to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
Moravetskiy believes that Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disagreement.
The European Court has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, has not taken on any public obligations to stop work on the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite demands from Poland and the United States.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a high-ranking Congressional staffer said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Schroeder warned of the consequences if Russia violates the Ukrainian border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.

The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, the head of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU that Russians now often use anticoagulants indiscriminately and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large Lakewood Evangelical Church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches that faithful Christians are promised wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cole was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the church discovery and, according to his words, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing."
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It seems that the discovery is connected to the theft that took place at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
Then around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church didn't suffer any losses.
A reward of $25,000 was offered for information leading to the arrest of the criminals.
Justin Cole could not claim this amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded a five thousand dollar reward and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20,000 dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.

The full protection scheme from COVID-19 has been revealed.
Anatoly Altstein, a virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and a distinguished figure in Russian science, has revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
He says that this can be achieved by injection and intranasal vaccination.
When given intranasally, a large number of A antibodies are produced. When given by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.

The main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19, said Sergei Tokarev, Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District.
He added that this would help because in this case the body's defenses should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
He says that this is exactly the picture that is seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.

In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog, who was running somewhere there.

The WHO has found the "micron" in dozens of countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain.
As of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries and all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it only began to spread actively at the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the high rates of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the WHO are concerned that the new strain may surpass the "delta" strain in terms of spread, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus that is currently leading in all countries without exception.
The former head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that the new coronavirus strain could have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.
In similar fashion, this also happened in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the next few months.
The number of people who have fallen ill in Britain will be around 1 million. This is while officially "micronomes" in the Kingdom are currently ill with several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the "omikron" strain, and at the peak, hospitals will be taking away more than 2,000 people every day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

"Will such a 'return to physical' growth of economy apps slow down? Not at all," - say the authors of the report.
India is the leader in app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
The United States (9%) and Brazil (8%) follow her.
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: on iOS had to 65% of all spending on apps.
The video editor CapCut was the most downloaded app in 2021.

Russians warned of new scheme of fraudsters
Criminals are finding new ways to commit fraud through video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestiya" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Product, Zurab Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances over video chat or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a planted malicious actor can put people in absurd, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
The leading Varonis systems engineer, Aleksandr Vetkov, in turn noted that psychologically people trust each other more when they see each other.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.

Eat a healthy diet.
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some people do not think this is important, and they are wrong.
Sugar diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing your drinking habits - reducing the amount of sugary drinks and switching to plain water can positively affect metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Illness is not only influenced by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
English:
A similar diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova told about "migraine of the day off" in workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to feeling worse on the weekends.
The "migraine of the day off" is often the cause of worsening well-being after workdays, said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, head of the clinic of Systemic Medicine of Zhukova Pavelova in her Telegram channel.
She says that this often affects hard workers, who on weekends experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change in conditions.
Our life changes radically on weekends.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small break begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and breakage.
The late rise plays an additional role.
So if you stand three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
She arises in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor is most responsible for the deterioration in her condition, Pavlova recommended that she pay attention to what changed the most on weekends.

Scientists in South Africa have said that the Pfizer vaccine is not effective against the "omikron" virus.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against "omikron" was declared to be ineffective.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa have conducted a study and reported that the Pfizer vaccine is not effective against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of "microna" neutralization) corresponds to the level of vaccine efficacy in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - the study says, published on the MedRxiv portal.

How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Excess sugar in his diet could lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as heart and vascular diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain dozens of names for sugar.
One of the most common and frequently occurring names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, hot dogs, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that gas will lose its importance for Germany within 25 years.
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
He said that Germany plans to completely stop using gas, oil, and coal by 2045 to become a climate-neutral country.
"This means that in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to FRG and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Schulz noted that Germany remains committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annelena Burbok, said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
The Minister said that, in the context of coalition talks and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also said that the pipeline does not currently meet European Union standards.

The majority of voters in New Caledonia voted against independence in the referendum.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of residents of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of independence for New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
France-Presse commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters to boycott the vote.
The initiators of the referendum, they opposed its 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the epidemic COVID-19 on the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" pre-election campaign.
This non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists have said that they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
It was reported on Sunday, December 12, that President Emmanuel Macron is to give a speech at the Elysee Palace following the referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has enlivened the past few weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for president have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who at the end of October published an article in Le Figaro, urging the Catalans to remain French.
Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position because it is not his responsibility.
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
The new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will start to create unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced by the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Aleksey Arrestovich, on December 11.
This means that they are able to act against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft equipment: the fuselage and the like," he told Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arrestovich said that they are reactive, not piston drones.
He says that this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpasses it in all respects.
The first batch of the drone should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA flying machine was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian general staff had secretly gathered data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during joint military operations in Donetsk.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction had begun in the country on a factory for the production of modern military drones.
He says that Ukraine is planning to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a training center in Kyiv Oblast for personnel, as well as testing and servicing of Turkish Bayraktar drones.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a "big real step forward."

Two tigers managed to escape from a container with a family of lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't move away from him because of the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranq darts and are planning to take them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
The animal returned home voluntarily the same day and no one was hurt.
Specialists have warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Studies show that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
Experts believe there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to watch the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, always monitoring dosage and avoiding cereal with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is contained in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, up to 75,000 people could die from the omicron strain by April.
British scientists' forecasts show that, due to the spread of the Omikron-strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported, citing research by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), that
According to the most optimistic forecast of the specialists who are part of the scientific and consultative group on emergency situations at the British cabinet of ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no fewer than 25 thousand deaths from the Omikron strain, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the hospital's illness, more than 2,000 infected will be seen daily.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overwhelmed if the Omikron strain turns out to be more contagious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections, said mathematician Rozanna Barnard from LSHTM.
The UK's Health and Safety Executive has previously informed that if the speed of the omicron-strain's spread remains at its current level, then by the end of the year there will be around 1 million cases of infection in the country.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become the dominant one in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1898 cases of coronavirus infection with the Omikron strain in the United Kingdom, 633 of which were identified in the last 24 hours.
While on December 9th the head of Britain's Ministry of Health, Mr. Javaid, stated that in reality this number could already be reaching 10 thousand cases.

The demand for supertankers has increased by a quarter in the world.
Superyacht construction is breaking world records this year and next year's orders despite calls to reduce carbon footprints and combat climate change.
In the world register of boats the number of ordered yachts made up 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
It is difficult to imagine that the number of people who want and can afford a floating fortress for 50 million dollars or more will not decrease in the era of fighting the consequences of climate change in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, writes "The Guardian".
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than last year.
Brokers say that there hasn't been this much excitement on the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held via zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, just so their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In western society, many people criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Rich people, say sociologists, don't want to understand that during times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts, or private jet travel can cause irritation in society because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to implement this with the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a keel length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke is building a 183-meter yacht called REV Ocean.
After it is launched, it will be the biggest yacht in the world.

But it has symbolic value if we take into account that there are just over 2000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than the average person's footprint on the planet.
If one person emits an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the world's largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere in 2018.
While two-thirds of his emissions footprint came from his 162.5 meter long yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not evoke sympathy from other people when, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of bowel cancer has been identified.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol in drinks per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is according to the Daily Express.
Specialists have come to the conclusion that the use of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to the harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But they don't even realize how intelligent four-legged creatures really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out how animals' intelligence has developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond consecutively to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics, or art, but they often manage to trick their owners.
Some experts believe that representatives of certain breeds show better results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
Some breeds of dogs are traditionally considered to be geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability, they do not lag behind a two-year-old child.

The Ukraine is preparing for trade with the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "trade" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for "Gazeta.ru."
He believes that Washington and Moscow are planning to continue talks soon on guarantees from the United States regarding Ukraine's non-entry into the NATO alliance, despite American leader Joe Biden's words about the right of countries to "join anywhere."

China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Production Equipment Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province / Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said Hou Chaoven, a representative of the company.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which went into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with data technologies that will provide increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
China has significantly increased its exports of railway vehicles in the past six months, and many Asian and European countries are witnessing the "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd., destined for export to Europe.
These trains will operate at a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour on railways in Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.

The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness, said Fan Yao, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
This sector provides the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the world market, said Fan Yaojiang.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a leading system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaojiang, the country ranks first in the electrification of railways and in the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Goloshekin listed the early signs of dementia in an interview with Sputnik radio.
He says that signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and decreased abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion about how hearing loss can be both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, to date, medical professionals do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin its prevention in time.
He says that studying foreign languages and being actively social will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Goloshekin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking," said Goloshekin.

The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
The former president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otari Toidze, who is part of a consortium of doctors created by the Georgian parliament speaker.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The specialist said that the main problems facing the ex-president are problems with mobility, coordination and changes in character, noting that this is not outside the scope of what is normal and that he needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurorehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began a hunger strike in protest of the denial of medical assistance after he was subjected to disciplinary punishment by prison staff.
Georgian politics quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

In Spain, there have been protests against COVID passports.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of demonstrators was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
English:
In Valencia, a passport for vaccination is also required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
The protesters in this city have claimed medical dictatorship, and vaccination has been called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted a bill on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail establishments by presenting either a vaccination certificate or a certificate of a previous illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and by plane.

The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow for the collection of the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of lagging remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure development in the region, there is also work being done on landscaping: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still far away.
Justin Downs, an organizational consultant for the Games, says that the Chinese ski industry has changed unrecognizably since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese people travel to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Mokong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents are unemployed.
The country is opening more and more stores that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Restaurants with national dishes are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
Over 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty because of the pandemic, the WHO said.
Over 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress on universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said.
In connection with the observed December 12 International Day of Universal Health Coverage WHO and UNICEF have published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in healthcare services and caused excessive strain on healthcare security systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, while the mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and UNICEF emphasize that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

The panel discussion at the "Summit for Democracy" organized by the United States that Minister of Digital Technologies of Taiwan Audrey Tang was speaking at was recorded on YouTube without video.
The Reuters news agency is reporting that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
They said that the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Mrs. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world by the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked as "free" in green, and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked as "closed" in red.
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "One China" policy adhered to by Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the National Security Council of the United States angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place on December 9-10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize summit, the editor-in-chief of "Novaya Gazeta", Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averyanov, said that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

China is stepping up prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular ordering the strengthening of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection across the border.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the test for COVID-19 nucleic acids, obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who are arriving in cities where land border crossing points are located must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
It is stated in the document that these requirements will come into effect on the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
It is also noted that cities where land border crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that there was a "sad conclusion" to the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Ryabkov, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with "Izvestia."
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some perspective of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey we have taken with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the United States' desire to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that he would not risk making optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is being made.
Russia urges the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
A virologist has warned of the dangers of vaccinating with a nasal COVID vaccine outside of hospitals.
Those who are vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergy and will need medical assistance, so the first vaccination points should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virusologist, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
English:
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that the person after that sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in just one or two minutes, which can sometimes be very useful," said Natesov.
English:
He also emphasized that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it hits the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after it is injected.

The Prime Orto S1000 mattress has different levels of firmness on each side, and a total height of 22 cm.
The maximum allowable load on one sleeping place is up to 150 kg.
The base of the mattress is an independent spring unit "S1000" (1000 springs per sleeping place).

An additional layer of insulation made of felt has been added to the mattress springs for extra protection. This layer separates the mattress filling from the springs.
There is a 3 cm layer of coconut coir on one side of the mattress which provides additional stiffness and durability to the mattress.
On the opposite side of the mattress, a 3 cm layer of coconut coir and a 1 cm layer of natural latex have been added.
Natural latex has anatomical effect and wear-resistant properties.
The mattress cover is made of cotton jacquard, stretched on environmentally friendly Hollcon material.
The fabric is treated with a special antibacterial agent called Sanitized (Sweden).

In the United Kingdom, 1239 cases of the omicron-strain coronavirus were recorded in one day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1239 new cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in the past 24 hours.
This is according to Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variety of infection in Scotland, and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the United Kingdom has reached 3137.
Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine previously estimated that, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "micron" strain, 75,000 people could die in England by April.

The press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It's impossible to impose sanctions against Russia and not suffer consequences ourselves," said a Kremlin official on Russia 1 television.
Peskov claims that "everyone understands this in the world."
The United States is reportedly considering imposing energy-related sanctions on Russia as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles to dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

The residents of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French territory.
This was reported by the French channel BFM.TV on December 12th.
Against independence voted 96.5% of those who voted.
3% of the residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots have been annulled.
The level of participation in the vote this day was very low: around 55% of the residents of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
A majority of the residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its territory.
There are approximately 270,000 people living on the archipelago with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the New Caledonian administration that allows the region to vote on its independence twice, with a two-year difference in between.

The WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "micron" is less dangerous than delta-strain coronavirus.
English:
As of December 9th, "Omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
The preliminary data and the significantly changed antibody profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary estimates from the WHO, it is expected that the disease will be less severe than with "delta" - says the technical report of the WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "micronom" infection in the EU are proceeding smoothly or asymptomatically.
Together with this, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They "were previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
Anna Popova, head of Rospotrebnadzor, said that there is no reliable data yet that the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky.
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadym Denisenko listed four variants of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
He thinks that the head of state can stay without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will go to compromises on the Donbass.
Denisenko told "Glavred" on Sunday, December 12, about this.
The first scenario that Denisenko called "the perfect storm" assumes that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its involvement.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
English:
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
The Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on the issue of Donbass, which could lead to conflict within the country.
By the end of summer, Zelensky's positions will have weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to a former member of parliament, is 50-55%.
The third possible outcome of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a conflict between those who disagree with President Zelensky and the population, which could lead to a takeover of the security forces and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
English:
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
This could be caused by some event that would be a strong shock to society.
The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine, Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic catastrophe or Russia's aggressive actions, an ex-deputy believes.
The Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
It was noted in Moscow that it is precisely the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to record low levels, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest level since he was elected head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, Zelensky would receive only 21.8% of the vote, while ex-president Petro Poroshenko would receive 14.5%.
Only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

The poet arrested for his action on Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko 10 days they give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster that said #poetvrossiyibolshechempoet.
This quote belongs to writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under the administrative article on the repeated violation of the order of holding a public rally.
He was first detained on January 23 on Pushkinskaya Square at a rally in support of Aleksey Navalny.
The goal was to draw attention to poetry in generalâunfortunately, now people are losing interest in it. This is a decline in general culture in Russia, but there is also a small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to further explore the message of his message.
English:
What did they ask in the department about your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as if it sounded funny in some context of this word.

When they heard, they looked if not approvingly, then understanding.
Except for the monkey house that was blown up on all four sides, everything was perfectly fine, but I knew what I was getting into.

Researchers have found that potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help to keep the systems of the body functioning.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to the high content of potassium, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most benefit, the root vegetable is better stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express has previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as are other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products that contain carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened beverages, white rice, and white bread.
The Russian newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of potatoes in early December, noting a decrease in production in private households and an increase in processing capacity.

Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, the owners of the "RAEK/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Russian Internet and most of them ceased to exist, says the director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazaryan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks in part to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia ivi (part of AIVI).
Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, has the animated new release "Enkanto", but, judging by the video quality, it is what is called a screener (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 years later" of the channel TNT (enters "Gazprom-media") is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines.

English: Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultima.
This model is convenient because it has two different surfaces - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product only includes quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
The center of the model is equipped with an independent spring "micropackage" block.
This means that 2000 coils come to the sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
Their functioning provides for a unique fine-tuning.
The "Micro-Package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of springs "Dimaks", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: a combination of layers of kapok and natural latex is installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex on it, the other surface has a coconut husk.
This fill tandem has been classic for a long time because it not only gives the mattress orthopedic properties, but also anatomical properties.
If the mattress provides proper back support, then the latex provides adaptation of the surface to the human body.
English: The cover comes in an Aloe Vera-trimmed, three-ply cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
English: Orthopedic foam used in mattresses has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus's clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
The third mission is to bring a sample from Venus.

The multiverse will change Russian business.
The topic of universes became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event became an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, like those around the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them.
The multiverse should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating distance interactions in the context of a pandemic, as people are tired of the dissemination and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the result of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.

A British economist was unable to give a forecast for the year 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes that such attempts will end in failure.
In an article for Project Syndicate, he wrote about this.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increases on goods are temporary or not.
As the specialist noted, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' endless generosity has already run its course" and it is time to return to a situation where interest rates, taking inflation into account, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new inflationary surge.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the department of global research "Otkrytie Investitsii" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar course Shulgin called the monetary and credit policy of the Fed, oil prices dynamics and concerns against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on new car purchases in the first 10 months of 2021, 28% more than in the same period of 2020, according to data from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency.
To put this in perspective, the government spent approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) supporting citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.

Hyundai is in the lead in terms of this brand and the increase in the average weighted price of a car - over the year Hyundai's price rose by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of price increases was stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes for Korean brands did not grow as significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of European Business Associations in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the sales volume leader trio in monetary terms - Russians spent 10 months on this brand's cars 275.5 billion rubles, 14% more than a year earlier.
Mercedes-Benz is in second place with a value of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - both the volume of sales (37%) and the average price of a car (nearly 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) have increased for the German premium brand.
Mercedes-Benz is experiencing good growth in sales and average prices - more than BMW, for example - which is why its financial capacity is growing, explained Tatyana Arabadji, head of the Russian Automobile Dealers Association.
Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
The Russian Lada car brand has demonstrated average growth in terms of revenue (plus 28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on this brand of car over 10 months.
The companies that saw a drop in sales in 2021 are those that were financially weak last year: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
Russians spent 12 billion rubles on UAZ vehicles in 10 months, which is less than the 12.4 billion rubles spent on them in the previous year.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions affecting the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AVTOVAZ" has increased the price of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Automakers regularly revise their pricing on their own products and those of other manufacturers.
The Russian car market will continue to grow in monetary terms - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses contribute to this, experts say.
I think that, in the context of a car shortage, many car companies have been able to pass on to consumers some of the costs from previous periods that they were unable to include in the price of cars before.
English:
I think that in financial terms, manufacturers are feeling very good right now, supporting high sales margins.
One indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth of car prices, which are observed throughout 2021; the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, an expert clarifies.
The market will grow in the long term in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As demand increases, the ability to raise prices will be limited.
The Russian automotive market will continue to grow in monetary terms and next year, even if the growth in vehicle prices slows down, manufacturers will be able to make up for it in volume, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now trying to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
Increases in production of machines are not expected at a minimum in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is heated even further and uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation that has developed in the market, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold at a higher price than the original cost, an expert said.
Biden said that the United States would redeploy troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The United States has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion."
With this statement, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke.
"We've never had such plans," said the head of the White House, in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
English:
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops in a one-sided manner to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine's territory, the United States will redeploy forces to NATO's Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any attack by Russia, "Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukrainian territory.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's use of Turkish drones in combat, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

Felting wool as a craft began 8,000 years ago, but it was very difficult to find the wool of animals, let alone colored wool.

But I remember that the thought is material!
