The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a large customer of #PRS_ORG# and thus it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.

I find that really annoying.
English:
I agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
Although I find that it also does big siblings good to take care of the little ones to a certain extent.
Just a quick look, just a quick help, just bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
I don't see a problem as long as they can still be children themselves.
English:
You are the best judge of whether that is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay up with her for hours until she falls asleep.
It is probably legally questionable.
Perhaps that is also where the psychologist's statement comes from.
If something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
It's up to you whether or not you want to take that risk.
Can you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come back to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
A zookeeper commits suicide at the beginning of the story by drenching himself in food and going into the cage with his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, falls for the male therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The police officer has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
English:
English:
A woman jumps out of the window and another intentionally drives herself to death.
This confronting of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
English:
This is the general plotline and I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on one circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the gauge H0 and 0.
The LokSound 5 Decoder is offered with all common interfaces and always comes with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He is just as proficient in the DCC data format as he is in Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as common as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.

New cases of Omikron are worrying politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
All adults in England who are eligible for the vaccine should receive an offer of the vaccine by New Year's Eve.
English:
Everyone over the age of 18 in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was originally the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish regions.
English:
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get your boosters now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent.

Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in more detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often because of my job.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't want to help themselves or think that we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
There are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
I always want to make it clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just put up with violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.

At least Johannes Patrick could be relied on.
English:
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said, looking back at the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
She didn't rest after the game - she increased even more after the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
English:
The three-point shooting percentage was a mere 13 percent, 4 made baskets (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
English:
English:
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
English:
English:
While in Patrick's team, even the star players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came back to within eight points, after they had already been behind by 39:59.
Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there's not much time to dwell on it.
On Wednesday (7:00 p.m.), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Always looking dapper: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is touring with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
English:
English:
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by government order", to contain the Corona virus.
Other planned appearances during Advent will have to be cancelled as well, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
The artists want to reschedule their postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic from January.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia. As a young man, he sang a lot and enjoyed it.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchestra with fellow students in 1986.
The baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women it is no Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He's made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair slicked back and focused on etiquette, Max Raabe is now an integral part of the German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: No new housing will be created through expropriation
The new federal construction minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No single new apartment is created by expropriation, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A mix of different types of landlords, such as private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
The coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party in Berlin will set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not improve, Geywitz does not rule out further tightening of the rent control laws in coalition talks with the FDP in the so-called "traffic light" coalition.
The coalition agreement includes a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.

At least 100 people have been killed by tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has produced numerous tornadoes across the United States.
More than 100 people may have died in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like they're from a war zone.

The storms have left a 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of that, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had gone through, everything was gone.

Some parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates that there could be up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky, and the official numbers are increasing by the hour.

Companies are paying vaccination premiums and changing advertising slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, redesigning advertising slogans to vaccination appeals - following the German example - is supposed to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.

Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin's Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-See.
English:
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the heroes, intending to lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed
The goblins lie in wait for the hero in a hollow way and flank the cart to the left and right with bows armed with three bows each, while two spears stop the cart.
If the heroes should lose in battle, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the village headman's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his minions and come to the heroes' aid in combat.
English:
English:
English:
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later, so they're not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
The broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the time schedule was far behind the planned schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Even though it's dumb, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race.
English:
There was once again ignorance of the rules among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen is allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think that one should simply know such basic rules when commenting on Formula 1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time that they're both unsure of what's allowed or required by the rules—they're just constantly uncertain about rules in general.
I generally don't like Roos' affected commentary style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
This is accompanied by constant silliness which makes both of them look unprofessional, like when the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke orders coffee or when Ralf Schumacher says "UuuuuHD."
The latter is causing a lot of unrest in the comments section, apparently not taking it seriously.
Sky's advertising simply takes over at the end of races, as F1TV listeners can attest - you just have to listen to the German audio feed without commentary after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising during the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
RTL does a better job than advertising for the four races they are allowed to broadcast.
This year's F1 season is much less enjoyable than it could be with a decent broadcaster.
I'm curious about your opinion.

It is also possible to operate a filter system with air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
English:
English:
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model. Fans can also be used to create an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration which transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell, or something similar to name.
The MK series has a special sound-dampened construction which results in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
English:
The water pump should be level with, or higher than the water line, and be mounted on the outside.
The fan pump should be set lower than the water level to prevent backflow.
Cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if ever water would run backwards, that the water from the basin through the pump runs...
The fan pump should be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we list the processing time as 3 days on eBay, we pack every day and the packages are picked up every day as well.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take some precautions so that nobody gets upset if it takes a little longer once.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all of the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services.
People naturally like to complain about these services, even though we're saying at the moment,...they're really struggling.
This varies a lot by region.

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, on Saturday.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos himself took the newly crowned astronauts in reception after their return.
English:
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and thirteen seconds on their way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
English:
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
English:
English:
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies mostly autonomously.
The capsule that was separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the limit of outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned All-Ausflug by Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers, were also present at the second one in October.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism industry forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry.
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory doesn't bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry laboratory behind me).
I, of course, also looked into job prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely study until I received my PhD.
I am currently having doubts, especially the job prospects are depressing me.
On one side (Studycheck etc), you always hear about great job prospects and that the profession is in high demand. On the other side, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
I'm really curious about this:

NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molting process and new feather growth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 ug Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in birds is due to nutritional deficiencies.
The feathers are made of protein-rich substance, so a balanced diet rich in protein is necessary for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large number of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds and balances it out.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be given.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.

It is a very rare locomotive, most likely originating from the ME Heft 11/1968 model railway proposal. It is used with play wear and missing parts, as seen in the photos, but is in good working condition. The E 95 series was a heavy freight locomotive designed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) for use in the Silesian network. It is possible that the kit also came from the small-scale firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operational refurbished
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.

English:
Everyone survived the Second World War and later found themselves on the territory of what would become East Germany.
The locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as war reparations in 1946.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
All six locomotives at the Dessau Railway Improvement Works were found to be in need of repair.
As the electrification of the central German railway network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight train services increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines used as spare parts donors.
English:
English:
The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren train depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own timetable in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The increasing complexity of locomotive controls proved problematic as age increased.
This often happened where the shooter would get stuck during gear changes.
The fireman who constantly rode on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wedge to loosen the brake during the ride.
Damages to the driving motors occurred more often and led to months-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were retired.
English:
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the E 95 01 followed as the last, quitting service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heater at Halle main station.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
The initial external restoration of the locomotive began in 1979 with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
She has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then.
English:
The locomotive is being taken care of in a museum in Halle (Saale).
Employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive since 1995.
English:
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves to be reliable and requiring little maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig in the central German network.
The main area of operations was initially Silesia.
English:
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.

However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.

A house fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential property in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit Euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjoining house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation, according to reports.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not suspect arson.

To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes photo of vaccination
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend has moved him to share, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false rumors on social media that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated.
My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For a few months now, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
I was deeply saddened when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
English:
He didn't ask for the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Angst can be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences instead.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not currently allowed by law to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of the vaccine in Germany.
The prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
A fire at a power station has left tens of thousands of people without electricity.
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more power and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had knocked out a power station.
English:
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several communities were affected by the power outage.
The power supplier Westnetz reported that numerous backup generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread power outage could finally be completely fixed late at night.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The utility company thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
English:
The repairs will take a few days as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to the company.
The power is back on.
The fire that broke out at 7:15 p.m. on Friday has, according to Westnetz, heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
English:
English:
English:
English:
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected as of 9:30 p.m.
English:
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and that they notify the local fire department if help is needed, explained Sebastian Schuster (CDU), after a crisis meeting.
The main focus when setting up and operating backup generators was on residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, temporary care facilities were set up in schools according to government officials for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or who needed medical care.

We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have a 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot slide it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate feedback.
Yes, that is much easier!

In order to get an even and clean coat of paint, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to get rid of any dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply a new color to your model with a brush for the first time, it is recommended that you practice with 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts that will later not be visible, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
English:
English:
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark could show through later.
English:
Otherwise, unpleasant metal streaks can occur when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals or stickers.
English:
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible.
English:
The most important thing when gluing is not having the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, but having time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out in order.
English: Decals are also called water-slide decals because you briefly wet the back side with water until the backing paper darkens from the moisture.
English:
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Always check that the picture is in the right place before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or tear.
English:
This is not suitable for children under 3 years.

English: Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing the private health insurance, it suddenly refuses to pay.
In order:
We applied for fertility treatment with our private health insurance in advance and were approved for 3 attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was reimbursed by the private health insurance.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we didn't yet count them against our health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance company again and were granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, of course, the most expensive ones are calculated with the private health insurance), we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first approval expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
English:
What are the experts' questions here?
Who is right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the promises that the further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
English:
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help in advance!
Can you please send me the three options by email and tell me how I can reach them again?
Okay.
We will not order anything else from them.
If they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
English:
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was processed and now you're telling me I have to return the item.
I can't help it if the dresser arrives completely upset with me.
English:
It is clear and evident that the refund has been processed, and I have still not received a refund from #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal wear and tear.
Otherwise, they're not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
English:
No, I am not able to get a different type of packaging.
I will be able to take the wardrobe apart and make it available to the moving company.
English:
We're sorry, but we don't carry the stools that are advertised as being available with these products.
English: Can you help?

There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about that:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What is it that appeals to you?
What do you guys not like at all?

Hello
English:
The EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
English:
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of limbo - Belarus isn't quite giving in, but the EU feels like it's winning - is probably going to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the way people are treated at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
English:
This development weakens the cohesion of the Union at the same time.
English:
Bossong argues that the EU is also paying a price for its policy at the Belarus border in that a basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
English:
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again attempted to cross into Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were arrested and returned to the border overnight, the agency said Sunday.
English:
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them in with the prospect of being able to travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has used its market power to weigh in and demonstrate its resolve to operate with tough sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to be prepared for the security apparatus to regularly funnel thousands of people through the country.

The first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park showed again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the fans having fun together on the roller coaster is confirmation for us, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels at the same time.
English:
There is practically no difference to the original audible anymore.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which may have impedance between 4 ohms and 32 ohms.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual sounds can be adjusted in volume.
The super flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows for the faithful simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separate adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.

There are problems with the glass fiber and the Devolo DLan/Magic.
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few outages.
English:
However, at the other DLan module, which emits the wifi, no longer the full 500, but the further I move in the house with the module, the less comes in (ie a socket is used which is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms from the other module is located).
This leads to the internet being slower with the new fiber connection than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
English:
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to run LAN cables throughout the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased with a response.
When it's time to switch your checking account
Who would have thought that now there would be peace with the checking accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the negative interest rate allowances are also continuing to decline.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's just halved the tax-free amount and even quartered it for the savings account.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Now, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
English:
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks have now set a limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin even received right against this regulation.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.

Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
English:
It's actually a miracle that you're able to win the hearts of both male and female fans alike.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her true love.
She has crossed the baby off her list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
This hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what is wrong with me, medically, why I can't do this.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame make one happy as well.

Hello wonderful girls and women!
I have a lot of things that I just want to write about, and maybe some of it resonates with others too...
I am 24, have PTSD, full-time student, and dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him; we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage from a burn).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week) which is very difficult for me in terms of my need for affection and love.

I realized back in school that a lot of religious studies teachers don't actually believe in God, and to them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this has always been strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and always believed it somehow.
English:
Perhaps you could also tell of work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
It would just be weird to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
Why would someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Keep culture alive or something?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I enjoy writing in English, I understand it well too.

Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
The film has two timelines (or parallel universes).
The modern world.
The past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman who I cannot describe in the real world.
In the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier wearing a uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean.
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
I think both soldiers are fighting each other at the end.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply would be enough to operate on its own.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the power adapter plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happens.

A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?

With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
English:
The "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) also presents the series in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is literally packed with innovative solutions from Peak Design's Everyday Backpack series that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while providing quick access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently designed solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor beams, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is heavily loaded, take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The snap closure and hook are also magnetic.
English:
The second option also differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: in addition to the top flap, there are also zipper openings on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top-access backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
This clever detail also increases the backpack's everyday usability: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
You can individually configure the interior of the Everyday Backpack (more on that below) and thus store both easily separated from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack half and don't get in the way.
English:
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made completely from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're going to Scotland in the fall.
I'm waiting in vain for an email from their support.
English:
The shipping company has announced that they will be contacting us to pick up the wrongly delivered table.

In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
"For many, it was 'Coloma or bust'!"
You are a pioneer in this game, seeking wealth in the west and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river basins and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers or you'll go bankrupt along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to budget your resources, and build up a tableau that increasingly works for you (so-called "engine building").
English:
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a three year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While every round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can take actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
English:
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
The players then take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters.
English:
The announcer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, so each location is hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why Kids Aren't Tyrants - Documentary, ARD Mediathek
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about parenting.
Ex-patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to endure.
I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be about power over the child for us parents and other responsible adults.

The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing obligation for those vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
We countries need quick clarity on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have received three vaccinations is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference next Tuesday.
I want to return the lamp.

A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuner.

Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
Only one federal state has a value above 1000.
Only the German state of Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute announced the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
The incidence in Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in the country, was 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower on Friday and Saturday, but also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals with intensive care on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
The health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the new cases.
I understand.

Greetings, fellow members of the Bundestag! I am u/StratorDE, here in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe, on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the German parliament in recent months, you can see that it is non-existent.
We've gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer slump for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
The majority of this is likely due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we are in general.
In recent days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here are still interested in the German Bundestag.
We need to change.
The community around the MBundestag is asked here which one it would like to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days has become aware of this project and, simply put, found a mess.

I was a vegetarian myself for a few years.
In response to the question of whether I've always wanted to be vegan, and whether vegetarianism was a planned stopgap measure, I answered honestly without much thought.

The Lahnsteiner Wehr is prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros in funding from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a grant decision of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle water rescue of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.

I find the question of right and left to be always very simplistically stated.
In general, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that naturally, people who are attracted to the right side of conservatism by magical means should also be aware that these people then have a hard time dealing with reality. Of course, it is also clear that, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine gay stereotypes, because they are rather less present in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom you would not notice unless they told you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or put their own at risk for you.

It is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad to start stereotyping and saying things that are controversial to politically incorrect as a result of negative experiences.

Hello, I (male, 32) have been occupied with a matter for some time now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little free time), but all my life I have been able to keep my house clean and tidy only with difficulty.

A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
I am starting to realize that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told before that I seem unapproachable (although I think that's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I would rather work in addiction counseling or family services than as a street worker or in an open youth center.
I don't know if the actual work day is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I fucked up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back from work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).

The protein ingested through the bird's food is broken down into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract, and from these, the bird's own protein substances are built up again, which are also needed for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the regeneration of feathers in molting birds is an extremely complex process and is associated with a particularly high level of stress on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be given during breeding as it can cause problems with the breeding process.
After this short course of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

Thank you very much for making it so easy!
Rat and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately not going well because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling on here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently taking the referee course as a career changer.
I originally studied something else and worked in that field (to stay at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that might be more fun for me.
I ended up in teaching eventually and was sure that that was it - even though the conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now on my third "I google other job postings."
It's only been half a year.
English:
I am absolutely done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
English:
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moment.
Now even the family reunion is too much stress for me.
English:
It's generally fun, and from an outsider's perspective the Ref is also going well, in terms of feedback and such.
I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I really want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring but at least it was paid appropriately and I was working with a team instead of being a lone wolf most of the time like it is now.
English:
English:
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, it probably won't lead to anything good.
Perhaps your views will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or at least enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has constantly evolved, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We're introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps that is absolutely on the cutting edge when it comes to sound.
English:
These amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier, of course.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
Additionally to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just gush forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the sound requirements of new additions, which in 2010 led to a performance boost in the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series, from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the power and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
While conducting a thorough analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier stage is primarily responsible for the tube amplifier's tonal character, and based on this finding they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Magic lose to Clippers despite 20 points from Wagner
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro-closure parts, it adapts to your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible set-up would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photo things.

The volcanic eruption on La Palma is probably the longest in history.
The lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage in the three months since the outbreak began.
Is an end in sight?
The eruption on La Palma has now lasted 85 days, making it the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days has been considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make a prediction as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
English:
Just over 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava flow.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
English:
The banana industry, which is immensely important to the island and provides livelihoods for about half of its 85,000 residents, was hard hit by the volcanic eruption. The industry was already in crisis before the eruption.
Over 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with more areas heavily affected, according to the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner, and the kids will be eagerly awaiting the festive season.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them when combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How the Christ child became Santa Claus
English:
In the past, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the popular German tradition of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
English:
They object to the institution for these reasons.
Martin Luther turned Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, creating a new tradition.
The focus of gift giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Most Protestants don't see such details so narrowly anymore, so it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a firm part of Advent just like the Martin's custom of Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches, in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
There is a great deal of diversity in traditions among Christian countries.
Sources document a tradition of gift giving on the Feast of Saint Nicholas dating back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a joyful jumble over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
Santa's white beard, his sleigh pulled by reindeers, and his preference for coming down the chimney are some of the ways he differs from the historical figure of Santa.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost became famous.
Here it is not reindeers, but three horses, which pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

I would now like to stop taking this because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I got acne all over my body explosively when I last took a break about two years ago.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed me down and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years since the break, things have never really gone back to normal.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without any fuss, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I haven't been able to get an appointment with a dermatologist yet.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
The skin is such a thing.
I had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of peace, then large-scale psoriasis and acne.
I've also tried all sorts of different diets in the context of Christian illness, and I've settled on a diet low in sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else has really worked well.
It could also be that there's simply a hormonal issue at play, but when you've got construction going on everywhere else, you just don't want to go looking for more things that could be wrong.

To plan lessons (EK)
English:
I've been at the Ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
My school is not technically well-equipped, so I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an overhead projector as a medium.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my lessons right now.
We are, for example, currently working on the topic of geo-factors and for me every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I also don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need it for office hours, etc.).
I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (most of the time I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with the book Terra and most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets.
Perhaps an geography teacher could show me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would actually like to return the old one as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the 2G rule for Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed in most stores.
The trade holds this for unnecessary and laments sales declines.
He has a possible solution ready.
The two-tier system is ruining Christmas business for retailers, according to the German Trade Association.
English:
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies are looking negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many people would have written off the Christmas business already.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is often a bottomless pit now," said Genth.
Dealers who lost 2G access restrictions lost about a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
It's only running well in the food retail sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
English:
"2G is not going to help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations are deterring customers and requiring high levels of staffing.
The bandage regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all stores with the bracelet received that day.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as they already are in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested).
Also the real estate company specialized in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at about 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now sure to fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, prove their 2G status at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all the shops without interruption." dpa

The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
English:
There are two standard color temperatures for brightness adjustment: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and save the color temperature manually in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The 120 degree beam angle that allows you to light up large areas at relatively close range is excellent.
English:
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult to reach places.
English:
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
The slot for NP-F batteries (not included) is also located there.
User Memory - The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To change the settings for each of the presets, simply hold down one of the preset buttons and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
English:
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a battery tester built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for mounting so that you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of setters on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and consequently designed for durability and tough use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.

The German women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after their humiliation against Denmark.
The German national team suffered a heavy 16-32 defeat to Spain in Granollers in their final game of the World Championship main round, meaning they will now have to face the hosts in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said Germany head coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8: 2 points in second place behind the Danish (10: 0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game from everyone and we need to delete it, said Captain Emily Bölk.

English:
We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense, admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We now have to look quickly forward."
From front to back, not up to par.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
English:
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This was not the hoped-for spark.
English:
The game was effectively over when it was 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially when Mia Zschocke was shown red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
She will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals.
The German national team didn't start playing well until the last phase of the first half, and by halftime they had only closed the gap to five goals.
The slim hope for a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
English:
The German team was unable to raise itself to a higher level of performance and left the court as the clear loser.

I would like to give a gift voucher.
So just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers.
Does that work for you?
I am a vaccinating doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
English:
I am happy to answer questions without time limit about the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a person (for example, "I am taking medication X, is that compatible with the vaccine ..").
My responsibilities include providing information about the vaccine, determining eligibility (the person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no contraindications), documenting the medical information, and potentially providing emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
We often don't have a nurse on our vaccination teams, but "only" (for goodness sake, no disrespect intended!) a pharmaceutical-technical assistant for vaccine preparation, who however cannot carry out vaccinations (are not allowed to?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.

With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberg resident, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has caused some serious reflection.
English:
No, it wasn't a "nervous person."
And also not to someone who "everything has to go fast."
English:
The man from Amberg communicated the solution and probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines.
The "Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the stove."
English:
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".

I have restarted, connected, and synchronized the #PRS_ORG# with the PC, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.

This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit for my bike tour next week.
English:
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happens in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
There is glass on the track.
English:
I didn't have the opportunity to get a replacement coat or replacement hose because of the day of the week, so I had to turn around and take the first train home.
English:
Now I am standing in front of a question and hope that you can help me.
I have a relatively long journey ahead of me over several days, and I would very much rather not have this problem occur multiple times.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike did 120km until 2 pm!) And he had already called them suboptimal, because he had driven on them for several years.
English:
Now I've started talking to an older man at the platform who's surprised me by asking why I don't have Marathon Plus tires; I've been told they're puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting.
English:
I don't really feel like spending 40€/tire only to be disappointed in the end.
I'm still wondering: I'm probably on the racing bike 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
English:
The Swallow-side seems to my absolute! Laiewissen rather the Durano DD to recommend?
Thank you in advance for your help and kind regards!

After the release of our new high-end B 100-6 OHM broadband, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new life.
The new Solo 15 is visually similar to its predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a matching foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is particularly well suited for people for whom maximum volume is not a primary concern, but who still want to achieve exceptional sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels virtually unfiltered.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
English: On the contrary, she appears quite mature and impressively accurate and precise for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in highs.
This is generally done with broadband to optimize the strong bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is perfectly aligned with the listening position and provides very clear and fine sound.
English:
English:
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM make it a unique enemy.
The SOLO 15 not only supplements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan corresponding changes during construction, as with all our kits.
If you want to veneer the speaker cabinet, for example, you have to adjust the depth of the speaker accordingly because the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to run the cable through there later without any problems.
The speaker opening in the front is now cut out using a router, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush-mounted later.
The back of this opening should be chamfered at 45 degrees to make the opening of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four mounting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail phase".
English:
English:
English:
The stiffeners themselves can be varied in thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.

Next, use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
The footplate is glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
English:
English:
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
English:
In the upper part of the casing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and also left loose there.
The crossover is being prepared and inserted below.
The frequency crossover blueprint, as well as the corresponding connection blueprint, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
The crossover is installed and the terminal is screwed on, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
English:
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
English:

English:
To dampen, a pad of the dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed throughout the housing.

Hello to all,
We're excited to announce that we'll be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
We are unfortunately unable to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which has meant increased planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
English:
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
Hey, it's still a pandemic - but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 12:30.
Get drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
