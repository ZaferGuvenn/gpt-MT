The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career lately, is returning back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon make his way into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň, and the Russian team Čeljabinsku was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Right at the midpoint of the game against Vegas he was substituted and since then he has yet to appear on NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body," the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL net eventually stretched out to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
He recorded 94.5% of the saves in the AHL.
The Plzen hockey graduate is finally looking to make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season he had issues with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille for Christmas wishes, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas greeting this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photograph of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC informed about this on their website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues, and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte has the same dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear when the photograph was taken, and William and Kate did not reveal who took it.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas card in front of a bale of straw and a pile of wood at their rural estate in Norfolk county.
The photo, which served as a Christmas greeting, was also released by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein was captured in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask that matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - In the current corruption case, detectives reportedly worked with the allegation that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported that it had access to parts of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of the Vršovice Club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the Red and Whites had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red-Whites was in frequent contact with both Berbr and former sports director of then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the criminal investigators, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdík.
The file does not indicate whether the police are still pursuing this information, according to the server.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the dynamics of Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
"We have never engaged in any illegal activities, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, or provided any financial remuneration in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously insults some former Slavia players of dark complexion and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked last October by a police raid on several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association.
The highest-ranking figure in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are Cold War LARPing.
The guns will be new, but of a generally inferior type (gunners must fire from an armored cab and carry shells by hand without protection).
Cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: Combat- decent, but at the end of its lease, Transport- too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential.
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export abroad)
SAM: Medium - Cold War, obsolete; Short Range - Good, Modern, Relatively Good Numbers.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the town.
Nutrias were climbing out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I was there for a while.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I had hoped she would leave before anything came out, but of course the fox went away soon.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shat himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That is, the meadow can be a nuisance.
On the other hand, it's not war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen on the thermal vision that almost everyone has nowadays.
So put your valuable items in a visible place, close to your feet in your backpack and you should be good.
Vojtěch vs. Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry procured respirators much cheaper than the Health Ministry.
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus has issued billions of crowns in the past weeks for their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for a respirator differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which agencies acted frugally?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations went through), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that the recruits can get their hands on, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, furthermore modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the abilities of the reserves will be rapidly diminishing over time.
To that, modern conventional conflicts, where one can deploy who, will play out very quickly, there won't be time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and it is also an expressed necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, fighting will only be possible in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
We mainly don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them are playing as if they had it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you look like a guy who two minutes ago couldn't hit an empty goal, driving into attack alone between two or even three Swiss players and you're thinking to yourself "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "dribble past defender" is so bad that I caught myself genuinely surprised when I saw our attacker manage to dribble past one of the opponent's players.
The First Signs of Spring
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting any major turnaround in the following weeks.
The surge in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time yet and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon to be added is also the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the current results reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic in order to find an appropriate treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
These researches often overlook the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and don't openly share their opinions.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as the beak grew us".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In Czech, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They fear cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing their job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But you will really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% according to the polls.
We even know that the objects are three in number and completely identical in Czech.
Identical due to the rotation of units so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, all the objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory for either security or deployment speed reasons due to its western location.
In the underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive to retrieve the head and mount it on some kind of carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often over-expressed himself, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went to him to explain something, rarely missed, went regularly, did sports with us, didn't steal snacks or phones, and was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips, did all sorts of silly things, but he was always okay, never got into any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after, they beat up the teacher, the police were often called in to deal with something, they threatened and intimidated other students..
I personally sell something on the classifieds every now and then (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any stunts on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me a month later saying he had already transferred it to himself..
I say to myself that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as is expected in a polite society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, drives out people from their homes and apartments, creates chaos around them, causes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, but I will be bothered.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it's all the same to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably travelling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons veered off into the opposite lane in a bend.
After colliding with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident the South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and remained trapped in the vehicle.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the Czech Budějovice hospital, stated the rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan where the post is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive, now you must add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email notification that customs is expecting the arrival of the package.
Then, just fill in the shipment information, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, it will be calculated by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the shipping.
In case the recipient does not arrange the customs clearance themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll tick one or two checkboxes, attach two attachments, and I'm done.
It's usually a five-minute question for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly, however.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people are not responding to requests for the data needed to complete the customs process.
Currently, there are 30,000 packages at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the necessary data and filled it in on time, we would be roughly halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solutions to Inflation
See title, how would you suggest a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow or offset this growth?
We see for example in Poland a reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much have you been given as an added bonus (who is the employee)?
They gave me a 2% raise this year which is a joke, but thankfully I have a similar income from the business I run on the side while employed.
Could someone explain to me why convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for as little as 6 months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can the court only sentence such an animal to 6 months behind bars just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma their victim will have for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it.
Will this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The Man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The Man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself had summoned her.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
First, he approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
When the police were called to the scene, they were astonished when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the police would come to the scene.
He actually just wanted advice from the officers on how to file a report to the Czech Police.
Upon checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, I obviously agree with the meme, too bad Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without any proof just because it might potentially bring benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
Here I cannot agree with Pascal, there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose then?
I would say it is quite likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a god other than him.
Even in the Ten Commandments it is written that there is no other god but Jahve.
Wouldn't it then be more rational to abstain from belief in any god, rather than risk picking the wrong one out of thousands and having the one true god I didn't pick send me to hell or some such place for it?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model is somewhat similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If one were to conduct themselves well, they could get a professional offer.
Something like this would be useful for all branches of the AČR.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can talk about this: There is a constant discussion about collaboration between the educational sector and industry, companies are fishing in schools and there is some kind of interweaving, where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongolian invader will ever enter here again.
It seems funny to me how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and so they will defend us if something goes wrong.
Well, bless my soul.
Just one option in the US that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that consistently works as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed military and a population that can operate the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so why not.
We don't need border walls, that's so yesterday, but a tech-savvy teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How to Not Drown in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home buried in boxes and fillers?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that are in need of packaging materials.
Thus, a map of stores that will accept your used boxes was created.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a waste to treat them as single-use waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overfilled blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply, and also the saved money, as the packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Individuals bring us boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno when they accumulate at home, but we also have agreements with companies for regular deliveries of discarded cardboard.
We will use all of this when packing orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more mindful world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application, however, shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The project map in total now contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It just seems wrong to me that technology is so simple and foolproof nowadays that kids who use a computer or phone to play games don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because for example Google Photos or Apple's Photos app or really mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything onto one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of straddling the right and left agree on little, but on Europe, yes.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators quickly came forward with criticism that Macron was engaging in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, wasn't so bad, and it's having quite a bit of success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičovou.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, he held the top spots in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being under the weather" I had a few days of diarrhea and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than a regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Just personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone does it this way)

Another helping of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A tale of returning to one's roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
The Bohemist and Comparatist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its rendition surpasses folk versions with brutality and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the path back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of return from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains will start running according to the new timetable, with some changes in operators in some places.
Starting Sunday, trains will be running according to the new timetable on the railway.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, and possibly their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets already during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in Northern Moravia or in Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their fares annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry into the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier here will replace Czech Railways following its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will be running a total of 16 connections daily on the route, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopping at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain similar travel times for its long-distance trains despite the planned works.
With few changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be changed on some regional routes.
Changes await travelers, for example, in Ceskolipsko, where instead of Czech Railways, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the route from Mlada Boleslav to Ceska Lipa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a unified fare on the railway for the second year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will be increased by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning to see the other side?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, died.
In life, I have never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave side or from that time, nobody is defending this, just condemning it.
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold each other into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they had been slaughtering each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately omitting facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, I won't deny that (for example in Japan, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it is what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when it comes to those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Additionally, the North wasn't much better than it is idealized by many people today.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt like at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported that.
And when I imagine these people being much older one day, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and it's no longer about the same thing, it's become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, are labeled as feminists, which leads to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Additionally, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I've just met with bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something connects me to people, it's interests, perspectives, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
That Slovak pastor is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always says some nonsense about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Then there is of course the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there they do a mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Flame is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it over from Austria.
The Bethlehem Candle, lit in Bethlehem where Jesus Christ is said to have been born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not travel to Vienna this time either, but they received it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They also took it over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the scouts take the train to Vienna for it.
Nothing changes with the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On the subsequent distribution of light, scouts couriers will take care of it on Saturday, December 18th, traveling by selected express and personal trains.
From there, the light will be taken up by local scouts or volunteers at stations, who will then spread the flame further across the Czech Republic, even to places where the railway does not reach.
This year, scouts must still adhere to the valid measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's running similarly to last year.
We recommend that both the courier teams and the organizers of local events should of course wear masks, try to keep their distance, keep their numbers to a minimum, not sing along with colleagues, and just generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, a spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light traveling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope and light overcoming darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and girl scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event stands on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to get a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer to the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the hallways saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is hindering development when this company is barely holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely agree, it's awful.
Even the person born in the internet age can sometimes get caught in some trick or trap - especially ads.
I thought internet ads wouldn't affect me, but then I still find myself influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that one can't always resist it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internets.
I feel like this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):

"I won't believe everything the media says"
"I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles – China, television networks and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies and this year they will premiere a record of more than two hundred for their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the movie database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only included those movies that have the word 'Christmas' in their title, so there will actually be many more festive films.
Movies traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated mainly with fairy tales, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
The real boom in Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC reminded.
Her advent project titled Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This station began to get its viewers in the Christmas spirit as early as October 22nd and will feature a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Competitor station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total count.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, humorously described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace for two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark channel uses the same formula for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's some misunderstanding that arises about half an hour before the end, which is happily resolved and the two of them kiss.
That's how it goes round and round, and as long as all the films look and feel similar, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive test for Covid-19 and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas stable will thus send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than the 20th place he had earned in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
The starting grid will thus feature only nineteen cars, with Mazepin's team mate Mick Schumacher starting from the last spot and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is reportedly okay and is showing no symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
"They are now in isolation and will be following the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," their representatives told formula1.com.
Haas cannot and will not send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with Covid-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Covid-19 had Kimi Räikkönen, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive.

In terms of the law, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
Therefore, in the same group as HIV, malaria, jaundice, or typhus.
Section 152 Spreading of Infectious Human Diseases
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the danger of the introduction or spread of an infectious disease among people shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to three years, a ban on activities or forfeiture of the thing.
(2) The perpetrator shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for two to eight years.
c) if he or she breaches an important duty arising from his or her employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him or her by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious harm to health.
(3) Imprisonment for three to ten years shall be imposed on the perpetrator who causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death by an act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) Imprisonment for five to twelve years shall be imposed on the perpetrator if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and he put in half a year's worth of work and all of his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, as sweaters were never really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours over the course of six months on his work.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then adorned the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a softness to the sweater," praises the creator of the piece, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" 720,000 crowns.

If it stops doing that, we will stop having that money.

You can argue that the money from those grants could be used better, but that's a whole different discussion.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Geologists, scouts, and drone pilots could set out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are helping their Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and to build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in response to the Belarusian regime's several-month-long actions of inviting citizens from Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already present on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in Southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We have currently reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
"No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been established," said Ciupek.
Six cases have appeared in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that there were two nurses from one workplace at the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of the above have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they had contact with anyone who has been abroad.
None of the listed have any connection to the water polo championship, said Ciupek.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player who fell ill upon returning.
California will limit the sale of firearms.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms in California.
Newsoma responded to the Friday statement of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, despite it going against the nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide up to roughly 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was thus shifted to the public, thus making it impossible for it to be challenged through the usual court route by the Texas Republicans.
"I am appalled by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow the preservation of Texas' ban on most abortion services and to largely uphold Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are the terms used to describe homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the Governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has been banning the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for a decade, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue certain officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where the vaccination scheme is gradually figured out and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies on the effects of 4 doses are already rolling in from Israel in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, it's just too early for that right now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to come to the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?

That does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland has threatened to stop payments into the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of the law if it used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU's recovery fund for economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing for the removal of EU funding from countries violating the rule of law principles.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept any concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But to make sense of it... At our Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I hadn't been looking at the other things, I had also seen the same yogurt multiple times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to, I won't even go to the market, sale or no sale, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's in some kind of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching how data is treated here like manure, most anti-vaxxers are just a little more off the mark than most pro-vaxxers.

They used to punish me with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I kept refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, mom always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after another "catching" she just brought and put the spoon so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few spanks on the bottom (over clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
I think the important part is the warning section, because it gives the child a kind of choice whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
In the end, it usually only took a warning for me to start listening.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swore and was taught from an early age in school, or rather an agreement that could be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be careful with changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs changes has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
It has been tested over the years with situations its creators (Vojtěch Cepl among them) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents suggests that political interventions into their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at FN Brno a few months old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less affected and less endangered than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
There are however children patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a pediatric infectious diseases clinic.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently being admitted to the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were continuously on the doctor's ward throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia that requires a stay in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
There are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have children of several months old to adolescent age," said the head physician.
He is however glad that the FN Brno Children's Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist's collaboration is an integral part of the children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus department.
It also highlights the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children can reduce the severity of the disease and lower the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose application even for children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside of the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest off marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor exercise?
Music is running through my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He was weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Kralove Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the outbreak under control and that its authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an impression of having the virus under control and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to contain the outbreak that has now become a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's hospitality?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the grass, washes the car with its trunk, and the kids play with it.
Just great.
If you want, I'll sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it'll be great...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: what the heck did you sell me for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant poops everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
He who sells says: speak not ill of the elephant, thus you will not sell the elephant...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is upheld, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
It currently works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
That occurred to me too and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be word-smithing.
I'm just going off the fact that an ellipse usually encompasses two different units at the same level.
Taking an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with “Spanish fruit and tangerines” it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Additionally, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know American complexes are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for the US forces.
But again, I'm just word-smithing :D
Either way, it's an unreasonable demand.
An earthquake of magnitude five was recorded in Tokyo.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a capuchin monkey named Milly.
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowers in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushes it and laughs at it.
Holland's monkey was also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
The primate rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse stated that they had never seen a macaque so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week custodial sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay €12,000 in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing okay, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would hunch and hide from anyone she encountered and any loud sound or sudden movement would cause her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, as she has settled and is content with her mate, her view of new people can still evoke panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after police in Gwent discovered harrowing footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat over drug allegations.
On the shots you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (roughly 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric era three times in a row, when you bravely skip over the entire 20th century?
So you're taking the same stuff in first grade as you are in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Mainly write the test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can figure out the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even bat an eye and tell you they couldn't care less.
So what the hell are we learning here?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learned for the sake of the many people who will need that thing.
But like, I was totally serious about that note that you don't really need all this stuff standing at the machine... ...because you just don't need it.
Additionally, we are slowly entering an era where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
(This is probably due to our communist past and the persecution of the educated and the elites) However, the price of having barbarians manning our machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, then Covid probably would never have reached these proportions here.
Married at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
"Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what about Kadrim disappointed her so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
There had been friction between Kadrim and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main issue was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She resolutely refused it.
And as it turns out, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a premeditated attack! Kadri snapped in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty to his ex-wife now didn't even please his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I normally don't comment on such things and we never really talked about these things much in my family.
I certainly don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I love so much, it just doesn't sit right with me!
I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
It makes me even more disappointed when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would really wish for everyone to know Kadri as I, our close ones and family do, stands in the declaration in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Chao began his robbery spree in the parking lot of a residential area, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, a total of approximately 330 crowns were stolen from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
The security camera footage then captures him walking away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and he called the police.
She then held Cchaa back.
The man admitted that he had consumed some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and effectiveness-bound to a pandemic alert.
When that is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law does limit the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections for the councils of four municipalities.
New councils people voted in on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number prescribed by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
A total of 99 candidates were vying for 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected councilors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said Deputy Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in Uherskohradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, 18.52 percent of voters gave them their vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, was also re-elected to the council.
The Komňané – independent candidates achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimovsko, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which translates to four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeat elections in Lužice on Mostecku were again won by the Lužice and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second-placed candidate, the People's Community, which received 43.27 percent of the vote, will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves on the Liberec region were won by the independent candidates of Naděje pro Novou Ves over the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters cast their ballots for the association of independent candidates, securing four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Statute Book.
What do you think would be the bigger issue?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think you already know all of this stuff that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's too bad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to look good).
And I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I dislike how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it hoarded, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but state and church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was attended to by the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Staff at the county's operations center received an emergency call at one o'clock in the morning with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two emergency medical teams immediately responded to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, medics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window around twelve meters high and landed head-first on concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have, and the fire brigade went into action.
Upon the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, secured artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after further measures of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns than the coronavirus from the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and medical staff who are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had an amazing night of fights with some interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňa was able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror in seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprises no one was expecting.
This brought a women's bantamweight match between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The start of the duel was also in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very aggressively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
Penová, however, was not forced into any further mistake and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm unsuccessfully.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both competitors exchanged plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Pena additionally got Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and back away.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to take down his opponent with an arm bar.
He didn't quite manage that, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on the back foot and bombarded him with a series of strikes.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out to the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In his next match, Sean O'Malley secured a commanding victory, landing a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
He then charged him with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
That knee, or this knee?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most substantive nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether it is masculine, feminine or neuter.
Then there is also a relatively large group of proper nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declined, they take on two endings and in some cases remain in the inflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, the former being declined according to the pattern "stroj" and the latter according to the pattern "píseň".
For the next group of nouns, the different forms in the nominative singular are already the same, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some terms may vary regionally, such as "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly with other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally not inflected, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "bufet", which remains in the neuter gender, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern "hrad".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like directly at the Greek borders?
Tension is mounting at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground like?
We hadn't seen a blue sky in three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating bushfires that Australia has been facing for the past four months have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?

Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with journalist Sydney Ikou Detrichovou.
False accusations have always been and remain quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People are uncomfortable addressing how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them.
The prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
A lot of people have been put in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to finish the unfinished family homes and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material costs, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish already partially constructed family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unapproved homes.
In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses in a year and fifty percent of it has been accomplished.
For us as a construction company, it's hard in that we have to adhere to certain things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it for free," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will soon be facing financial difficulties.
If they had counted on the house construction costing five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will be waiting," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment were the materials that increased the most in price.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently the only one that is more favorable.
"Building permits issued in October totaled 7,675, which is nearly 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
Real vision is missing, says commentator of Czech Radio - mujRozhlas.
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, was traditionally accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the nation was addressed by the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What have we learned that is essential?
I think a diploma thesis is great because I get to choose my own topic, build on my bachelor's thesis, work on it for a whole year, and then write the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are pretty chill here, if the person isn't a total monkey and something stayed in their head, then the commission won't unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for my state exam and when I was at the end of my rope, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical deduction that I immediately understood and I had it right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then just learn the project and they're good to go.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the subject there is an exam that tests the knowledge gained through the project, not just a defense.
All good but don't flood emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much of a jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can still put up a similar statue of Putin next to the Teddy Bear Pú statue.
Maybe give it to him so that it reaches Xi Jinping's backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will drop to an absolute minimum.
Additionally, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I've been really annoyed by it lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
Finally, I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Working Party on Donbas
United - yes, broken - no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8th, 1991, in the Belovezhskaya Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17th, 1991, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open indulgent attitude, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting destroyed in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, stifled agriculture, and detached fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism from the world's largest power.
If we look even deeper, then we see impoverishment of the population, disintegration of the economy, sciences, army, rise of criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, expansion of NATO to the East, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is a result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
All that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events of the late 80s and early 90s of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket does not necessarily correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain discounts it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you describe the mechanism by which this change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I could wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 Kč/kg one day before the expiration date - how would this meat be different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This talk about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, rotten, or low quality is really stupid, to be honest ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take such things to help out the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused but I had a feeling it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found out who published it and eventually it turned out to be Scientology.
No, like it was good stuff, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I should wash and not be a brat.
Paper waste, this could have saved the rainforests from being cut down.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you care for them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me multiple times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship but then another half year passed and it started to go downhill.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will suck the life, emotions, and joy out of you.
Keep your distance
When insurance companies are recklessly buying up cloud tests and rushing to find positives who would not have known about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator got five days of home detention.
Out West they have stopped with the clowning around and realized that it's not worth dealing with a sickness weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing some nonsense.
Looks like the old scoundrel is back again.
After several years of dormancy and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, however the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first earned money came in, one quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to push out a few certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only income-generating, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots and pans.
What I can say though is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every piece of gossip and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone into one basket.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be bragging about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't experienced many of those things in the corporation where I work.
HR is hands-off, managers manage their own stuff and don't stick their noses into anything.
So regular assessment does happen, in the form that it works here it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, look at what worked and what didn't after a year) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone evaluating you based on numbers and such.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a bit of an anomaly within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're this almost-startup that's squatting in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so we don't bother them too much, as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the outgoing Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be providing any further information about the case.
"Sincere condolences," Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work, she was supposed to pick up some money from an ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this context have already arrested one man a few days ago.
What role he had to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but has not been made public.
At the end of the year, four towns elected new councils.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number prescribed by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovna, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected to the mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
36 women and 63 men were vying for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils were held there, and most notably, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last polling district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the voting results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, upon approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest issue I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
Dealing with how stupidly a large portion of the population across all its layers approaches it, I still have a problem with that.
I'm most excited for the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I'll finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be deprived of the office of President and of the capacity to reacquire it.
The chances of it actually happening are though, as others have mentioned here, very slim.
Additionally, I'm not sure if the shredding of the file could even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic endangers its sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Has Impacted Intimate Lives: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Have Gone a Year Without Sex
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly consists of religiously-minded people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity has risen from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, or video games could also have contributed, making sex a lower and lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having had sex in the past year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them stating that they had been without sex in the past year 2021.
Among unmarried people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital contact and religious background also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while around 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among free individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious in nature.
Since 2008, among unmarried people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
"Among the less-believers, the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone declared.
Other factors such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic also contribute to the decrease in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which likely reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend has taken hold especially during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole debate about vaccinating against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, the one that I'm personally most interested in is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order it for them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we certainly could be held accountable for the death of an eighty-year-old person who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccinationist who is here shouting alongside the SPD and the KPD about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated seniors probably belong to the second group, so they will really have to take responsibility for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather can even complicate the preparation of the Jizerska Padesatka cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it doesn't involve a theocrat.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us across town to the boatyard so we could go boating on the river.
On our way there, we went down this quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended upon us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed the whole way to the boat dock.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič.
Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The Chancellor believes it is advisable to resolve the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group" comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border night after night.
The Chancellor discussed further sanctions to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured the DPA agency that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to cover it up.
The car eventually returned to the scene of the accident, but it was now being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to give way and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted to hitting another nun with her car who had asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and, upon finding that she had over two parts per thousand of alcohol in her blood, immediately revoked her driver's license.
They also informed her that she will be held accountable for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič did not guard his film.
Czech filmmakers drew inspiration from American stories about canine companions.
But they forgot one essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy movie F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie is now vying for the audience's emotions in cinemas - Here We Guard.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič ml. follows up his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012 with this one.
The talking dachshund Hugo is back on the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a struggling Bavarian guesthouse, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and most importantly, her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shajmovich (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least that one entertained kids and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mix of awe and embarrassment.
Let's summarize this.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to superstitious delusions in her longing for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing therapy of nature and the power of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, marvels at what a content-filled melodrama full of unbelievable situations and characters was necessary for this message.
A pair of thieving staff, a dog show competition, a Bavarian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal - and of course the wacky family at the pension gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma and immediately sits curled and made up with a cigar at the family table demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shajmovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct supporting situations, a sense for the characters and the point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is clumsy, and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and some dog-eared one-liners, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
Nor is long-term membership in the Dachshund Club - as in the case of the producer lady - an argument.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft in order for a person to tell a believable story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and not enough sentiment for a good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapy, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is seen how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to those kids more often, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The near complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two days of rain this week were more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the perfect Christmas backdrop, Nazaret Wasím Aškar's resident rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, there is an increasing number of cistern trucks.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river has run completely dry.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the Vienna talks had not yielded "any progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz on Saturday declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not made "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago too.
I kind of liked the lady and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicions of a pyramid scheme were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning and doubting the lady for a while and then thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have been able to open due to this.
The skiers were not deterred by the requirement to present a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people headed to the running trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather today, which offered both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased, that opening weekend really worked out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the Ještěd Sports Area Director Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also headed to the Jeseníky for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
Open were for example Ski Aréna Karlov or the resort in Branné in Šumperk region.
The weekend turnout was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The terms are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, without sparing praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after recovering from Covid-19.
With the exception of people being prepared and providing the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told CTK.
"We have only recorded a handful of incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
A higher influx is expected during the ski course period.
David Šinták, the director of the Královéhradecká company Snowbear, also feels that due to the Covid pandemic, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost fully booked.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
According to him, people have become lazy due to the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, the rental service in the Novako area in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now interested parties have to order them in advance.
"We're starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the area's operator.
According to her, there is also interest in a ski school comparable to the pre-epidemic period.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay here, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they would abroad.
That certainly doesn't include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and capable people are leaving the country with no property.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad like that.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is are there even elections.
When life is lived stupidly here, then some traditional V4 crazy person can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose wealth cannot be stuffed into an airplane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood due to a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the cast and crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), were enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a photo of his bloodied face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work on Sunday, November 28th around 7:45 PM and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Roe acted as an "assistant to the nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help to find her to contact police," the statement continued.
Publicly calling for cooperation is also MP Harriet Harman, who highlighted the case of the Srncové at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, and her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try and find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare," said Harmanová.
Police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
That is not "huge amounts", but around 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our interference.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing it to the situation in '38 is so off in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare that to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would be the "concentration" at the borders.
Oh, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables for Prague will be in effect from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have been discontinued.
The Mladoboleslavsko region is now being integrated into the system.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
On the suburban train service, the S7 trains will depart, which will pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will now be expanded to other areas.
Additionally, buses will go as far as Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starých Splavů and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladoboleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
With the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague Zličín and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
Services will be strengthened during morning peak and at weekends from Prague to Rakovnik, with the new express line number 404.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 supplemental line runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonného v Podještědí.
Conversely, the operation on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to railway modernization, there are ongoing restrictions on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and the vicinity of Kolín routes.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
Routes 540 to 543 to Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses to the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing the classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy's or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement after work, I don't have the energy to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and diet-wise as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I end up buying pizza bagels for lunch and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately.
And these are not trees that you necessarily have to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree may be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that it's the only reason why they forbid us to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Acknowledging Gifts of Relationship with Nedved: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing else since Friday than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent an extensive message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love from them for half a year.
"I would venture to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not heard that Dara caught a bear, excuse me, a Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But it is said that he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not take joy in it.
And here it is.
What we both dreaded but knew would eventually come, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone should know the list of your ex-partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, isn't it, Daře?
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was going for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been working there again for a long time as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They only went public with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife had been separated for three years, officially divorced for only three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are all just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commenters have already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found apartments together, which I think is the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments usually aren't advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it doesn't hurt to take a look at the offerings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that way is nice, besides it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where you are exactly enrolling).
I've never looked for a rental myself, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly help with Brno as a whole if you need any more information :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually okay that the state doesn't sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves or they go by the state and the state pays for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of education just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a claim loses some of its weight when it is written by someone who two days before had expressed themselves in such a way about a petition to boycott a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who assigned you the work.
Otherwise, I have experienced in cataloging/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either just guess, or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it in a footnote depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone has already figured it out here.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
That's a much bigger blunder than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, so a basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing non-standard relationships.
Additionally, the English language is quite interesting, post-Brexit.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's going great.
I drive from work at 10pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has never stepped foot in the ghetto can say that it is a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is loiter on the sidewalk and park where they're not supposed to :D definitely not something I'd be afraid to go out on the street at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable accommodation with good access to the city centre, then I'd go for it.
Many of the apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or Gelemová's lover like a stick in the mud!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I've seen Dáda's wreath and Lucie surely has one too," said the saxophonist to Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house on Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Little Bird still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we got together with Anika, Felix, and both of their grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying gifts gradually and I'll definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, probably perfume.
"I'm a gentleman," Felix said, who had come to the music video launch party at the Richman club himself.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have a good chat with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And are we the Island so that we can afford to have no soldiers or weapons?
I doubt anyone will come to our defense and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other folder that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
There are few police officers and they can't afford it, so too with the firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
And that our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through its worst period of drought in recent years.
Scientists have reported a decrease in water in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and even places where there was previously no shortage of moisture are recording lower amounts of rainfall.
The cause of the drought that is prevailing in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are further exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in relation to drought?
And how can we help nature in these tough times?
Yeah that's about it, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried out in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also pretty much a joke.
Whether you're the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But either way, what I hear from Czech commentators pointing out what referees pay attention to or don't pay attention to, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the same with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of Infections in Russia Exceeds 10 Million
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, plus another 74.
There have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the chief medical adviser to the British Health Safety Office, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omikron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkinson expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, however hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by hosting a Christmas quiz at Downing Street in December last year when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually", via computer.
However, there were groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street who participated.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial broadcaster ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is speaking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of European-wide significance.
How much can be expected to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, since the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, gerrymanders electoral districts to its benefit, and does other small and large tricks.
The latest one goes that everyone can choose in practice where they want to.
This will allow Fidesz to shuttle voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could prevail.
So I'll just reiterate that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big change for Viktor Orban and his party.
Won't they strive to keep power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, has leaked to independent media, where he is telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the hints of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (just in relation to me).
I am also very choleric and used to get so angry as a child that I would lie on the ground in a fit and turn blue, which happened to me twice and they had to take me under the shower to calm me down.
Sometimes they would spank me as a form of discipline, sometimes it was more out of desperation.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, like when I was little I used to fight quite a bit, now I just punch something to let out my anger and when I was younger I would maybe slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get a spanking), so nothing too extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly upbringing has its share in it too.
I'm afraid I'm going to be losing patience with my kids and dealing with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes up something at some point, so it's probably impossible not to mess up your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would thus call customers those who create laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I was wondering if you're worried about a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product so that you will have enough to pay off the mortgage?
Kočner's Monstrous World.
Where will Slovakia take the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins for the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It sparked civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What major breakthrough will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is hugely due to the journalists.
How is it possible that this petition had orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of all the deans of medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No way, they got carried away and the company paid the price for it.
People were dying of Covid on Czech television even half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government after years of delays by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local authorities are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers over storage, as promised to mayors since 2011 when work on this legislation began, as required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in collaboration with municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has available, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of selecting a location for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective can only be if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given location at all.
This can be ensured by requiring the Storage Management to request the consent of the affected municipalities prior to initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted draft of the material plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the permitting process.
The design lacks a system of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the storage facility, its permitting and operation.
Representatives of municipalities realistically have few options under current legal norms to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a storage facility.
Only in certain permitting proceedings can individuals submit their comments or appeal, however it is the agency or minister in whose interest the permit is being issued that decides.
Any lawsuit shall not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-determination of local authorities that the Platform is calling for is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those that have already progressed in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is furthermore another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was entered into by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work is to be almost 4 million crowns according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of the Cejle municipality from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage said: After the Industry Ministers, who only pushed off the equalization of the position of local authorities to the state offices in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities for their support, as they perceive the issue of inadequate rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that decisions on the selection of a location for potential disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight out of fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, eventually he was scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, according to The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new figure at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John joked that his friends and family were always asking him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's any text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, like a university one, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Games like Dark Souls etc. have several bosses, right, so a "boss" is something like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how can they even be called?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It's probably impossible to translate the word "boss" into one word in any language, including Czech (Catalan is interesting because it translates "boss" as the final enemy).
It is simply a computer-controlled, stronger than all previous opponents, and guarding the completion of some level or task, that is significant to the story or game in general.
The whole world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police have also become involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Peter Srncové since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
They have been searching for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncovou was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has now been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, is slender, and has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
It should originate from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear, however, who it is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected email attachment is designed to grab the user's attention with a title that references payments and financial transactions.
Whereas last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was labelled as “Copy of Receipt for 11.2021...exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malware actively searches for stored login credentials which are then sent to attackers.
The last major campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and September and with the approaching holidays and end of the year, attacker activity is again on the rise.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November have mostly detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks occurred continuously throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
Formbook contained most commonly an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The term receipt still appears as well.
An attachment in Czech can then be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the past few months.
That today's demo of smarties who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
From the shots of the procession along the waterfront and from my experience of the demonstrator, I would estimate around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the quay and bridge, and the opposite quayside road.
That means a lot to people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and the like wouldn't be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The Chcípl pes society's actions are gaining in popularity, it reminds me of the Milión chvilek for democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be cobbled together from this discontent, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine doesn't become a four or more dose one.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose one, as it is becoming increasingly clear that we will need to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant feat of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
At last, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more premature elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From secretly taken footage comes a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns were growing about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, the former employer of the children's hospital worker and the Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are also calling for information.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work on Sunday, November 28th around 7:45 PM and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Roe acted as an "assistant to the nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help to find her to contact police," the statement continued.
An anonymous person reported Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional Pirate councilor) for infringing copyright with her paintings.
The court, however, ruled that the Krtek paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Usti nad Labem there was a moon-shaped hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Transport Authority, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained open.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate began to "intensively address the situation".
