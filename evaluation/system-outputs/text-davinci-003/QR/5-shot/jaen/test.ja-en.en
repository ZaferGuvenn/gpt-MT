When I tried to buy the entry package, two packages came out, one blue and one orange.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What's the difference?
Please help me as I am unable to find out.
It should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They are the same, just look different.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who would be stronger if two people of the same height and weight fought?
Jiu-Jitsu
Traditional karate only practices sparring with other karate practitioners.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in particular, involves practicing with the added element of dealing with strikes.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation for Durandal's betrayal of Talia?
Did Talia and her partner break up because they couldn't have children due to genetic incompatibility, and is their genetic compatibility really that good?
Do you think that a Destiny Plan is pushing it too far, so there could be some backlash?
What do you think are the benefits of a woman getting married?

I don't even feel like watching TV anymore because there's so much of that stuff out there...
Is it because the comedians are overworked? Television is all about comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when I was saying it wasn't particularly funny.
It's creepy how some people laugh along with comedians even when they're not funny, just because they're popular.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood and make it awkward to work with them.
The industry is like the old black companies, with a sports club atmosphere, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a nasty attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who keep emphasizing the difficulty of their work in a way that seems to be belittling other comedians by saying "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that income is quite low until you become popular, but it's like being told every time that being an entertainer is a difficult job and at the top of the peak.
It sounds like justification for self-promotion and comedians taking up too much space in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the things that touch the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like I couldn't be healthy if I didn't let it out, like a fart.

Merchandise ordered from the Tsukumo Net Shop was switched without permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale and received the wired version instead, and was told that if I wanted a refund I would have to return it.
It's more of an online shopping trouble than a custom PC topic, but I can't make sense of it and it's a well-known place, so I'll post it here.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen in the Tsutaya Net Shop's Tsutaya Day Sale, which started last Friday (Linked to Yodobashi).
Since the wired version was the same price in the store, I checked the page for the wired version to make sure there was no pricing mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Tako), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order confirmation email and the next day I received the shipping confirmation email.
The names of the two emails and the purchase history on my page were written as "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS".
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to the shipment, the wireless mouse ordered was thought to arrive at this point.
Here's the problem: I got an email a few hours after shipping saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to the email
They were selling the wireless version at a discounted price, but it was actually the wired version.
We already ship wired mice.
Reject receipt and cancel all.
Return the mouse only for a refund.
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your compatibility.
It seems that the product page was divided into wired and wireless versions, but the delivery note, purchase history, and email all stated wireless versions, yet they sent wired versions without permission.
Isn't it unfair to expect a refund without any understanding when you send something different from what you bought and ask us to return it?
Please lend me your wisdom as I would like to retaliate with a single strike rather than accept a refund in the end.

Isolated Twice...The only bridge connecting the district to the outside world was washed away due to typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara district in Yatsukawa-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a significant impact on the lives of a family of eight.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was all over so quickly, like it was swept away," said the residents of the Takahigahara district, whose only connection to the outside world, the Takahigahara Bridge, was swept away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 11 households and 30 people isolated.
Residents forced to go without water used the JR railway bridge, which was usually off-limits, to transport the necessary supplies every day.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car there, I had to carry or carry it in my hand and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the convenience of transportation, the car. After the emergency bridge was completed a month later, it was isolated again for a few days until a temporary bridge was put in place due to heavy rain in less than three months."
Two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"I thought it would be best to secure at least two to three days' worth of food," so they stocked up on canned and cup noodle foods that could be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "I felt that it would be better for everyone to have some supplies, because you never know when a disaster might strike you personally, not someone else." Meanwhile, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" when the bridge was washed away.
The town started its own initiatives in 2021 to not forget the lessons.
Mr. Ryuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Division of Yatsuri Town: "We have announced that we would like to designate October 12th as 'Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and use it as a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
I think there is an increasing awareness of the possibility of the unexpected happening.

From what I can remember, in Hiro Yuki's video, the bad person said something like if you go to the organization that provides food, clothing, and shelter, they will somehow help you even if they tell you not to come (I'm not sure). So I guess there must be such an organization.
Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympics.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of tourism in Tokyo through digital means.
Running machines and road bikes were provided at the venue, and people visiting the venue were running a virtual marathon course recreated in the virtual space with dedicated equipment.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing for an experience of running a marathon course with participants from both inside and outside the country, while also being able to enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said... "The scenery was really different and really enjoyable."
"It's tough running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's really fun to run while enjoying it, and it's great to be able to compete with everyone and do my best until the end," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it in sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the used housing market is doing well with used housing transactions.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
With the coronavirus pandemic leading to an increase in people wanting to stay at home, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", while relatively cheaper newly built properties have seen a sharp decrease, likely due to the same influence.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act to introduce a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, to promote safe and secure transactions of used homes (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system where a qualified architect familiar with residential properties checks the current condition of the property, including any deterioration, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Commerce explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the transaction, giving the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for conducting building surveys is usually the seller.
In addition, attention should be paid to the fact that only the announcement of the inspection system was mandatory.
In other words, while real estate agents have the obligation to explain whether they can or cannot "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property", the actual implementation of such is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking abroad, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where there is a risk of concern with seller-led inspections.
Before a residential sale, the buyer will request an inspection of the building from an expert known as an "inspector" or "building surveyor" as a prerequisite.
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of all used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the buyer is in the driver's seat when it comes to inspections, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are vastly different from the seller-centric one.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building in the best light, and to sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are looking to review the inspection results and make the necessary repairs to feel comfortable living in the property.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are highlighted as potential risks concerning Japanese regulations.
The scope of the seller-initiated inspection survey mandated by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
There is a risk of overlooking really important issues due to lack of detailed investigation ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces them to the project in question can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility of an inspection being carried out with "leniency", such as not reporting unfavourable survey results to the seller.

It is important to go to a psychiatrist and get the proper treatment, as well as to have a record of the visits (very important).

Five Fun Facts You Can Talk About While Silver Bluffing (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula back in the day.
It's only in Ginza that you can show off your trivia knowledge with phrases like "As evidence... ...".
Here we introduce you to some interesting and fun facts about Ginza that you'll want to share with someone.
Going up Ginza!?
Infiltration of the Golden Vault
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As she and I were walking around Ginza, a sudden silence descended and she said, "You know, this used to be a peninsula."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of the bustling shopping district that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
The term "Ginza" originally referred to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year) the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
It was formerly known as "Shinryogawacho", but when it moved to Rikagakucho it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
Interestingly, the area around Ginza used to be a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a bay extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now known as Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Kiyomasa developed the neighborhoods and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
And they dug a moat, cut down the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet to create a harbor.
If you are interested, you may want to look for the stone monument of "Ginza's Place of Origin" which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Ginza Tiffany Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku).
The "Pilgrimage to the Sacred Site" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among the ten or more shrines, the most noticeable one is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
There are often people who visit the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater before and after the performance.
Meanwhile, the "Ryukou Fudouzon" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Dejichizouzon" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Takadonoinari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwainari Shrine" are tucked away in back alleys and not easily visible, but the "Toyoiwainari Shrine" is known for being revered by the Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. The "Seikoinari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is also closed to the public except when on the Hachioji Shrine pilgrimage.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most of the shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
The "Inari Shrine" where a fox greets you at the entrance was built with great enthusiasm in places where there were many farmers, in the hope of bringing the benefit of a good harvest of the five grains.
This in turn led to the belief that it was beneficial for business prosperity in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most bustling shopping district, faith spread.

I went to the dentist two days ago because I had a sharp pain like hypersensitivity when I pressed or touched my front tooth.

How to compile recruitment scripts & how to modify existing MOD scripts
I've been looking around and trying my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that, so I could start from MO2 without having to run scripts or resources, but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorials, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom mod.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do that...?

On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City, dead.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoji River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to the 110 emergency number.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he had died at the scene.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death in a hurry.
Meanwhile, an elderly man in his 70s was found lying in the river at Sakawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.

South Korea's Posco International Acquires Australia's Senex Energy, Expands Overseas Gas Field Business - Korean Report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, Posco International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the local company.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition price was set at KRW 7709 billion, with Posco International investing 50.1% and Hanhock Energy investing 49.9%.
Posco International explained that it had decided to make the acquisition, as the demand for natural gas is expected to continue to increase even in the energy transition era, and blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operational personnel in Australia.

Could that knee pain be osteoarthritis?!
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's Note: I have been having persistent knee pain lately.
What potential illnesses are there?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can cause deformities and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does rheumatoid arthritis affect joints other than the knee?
Yes, Professor Maruyama.
It can also occur in joints other than the knee, such as the fingers of the hand, the base of the thumb, the neck, the waist, the big toe, and the hip joint.
However, the most common is the case of the knee, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by two bones fitting together in a concave and convex manner.
The area where the two bones meet is covered by articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editor: So it has a complex structure?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovium, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
The reason why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing out knee movement is because of this.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone has rheumatoid arthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushioning role.
However, if it becomes worn down or misaligned, it can cause deformity and inflammation of the joint, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash I sleep in something like a tracksuit!
Are there people who can quit smoking cigarettes and those who can't?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but has since quit.
He said he was thinking of stopping, but then decided to just go ahead and stop.

Experience the Gambling & Games 3 Selections (Real Sound) from the "Kaiji" Series - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" which enjoys explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game of life and death.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tingle... ... Take on the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to take a look at the games of Kaiji that can actually be played or are being practiced in the planning videos.
Swamp - The pachinko machine featured in the gambling-themed anime series "Kaiji" is full of traps and is called "Swamp".
In the original work, Kaiji was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was rigged with large traps such as "nail forest", "moving dolls", and "three-stage crone", making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every trick in the book, eventually resorting to the outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji is actually a pachinko machine and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held as a pastime by the wealthy, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in a "human horse race" called the Iron Girder Crossing.
The debtors must proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin iron beams set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participate, with the top two able to win a prize, but there are only four beams and inadequate safety measures, making the risk of death quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but it can be experienced in a very similar way at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also deployed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge extending to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond it are the "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge", which can be reached on foot.
Of course, security measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kōran released a video on his YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming it was an experience that could only be had in Japan, which became a topic of conversation.
E-Card is a two-player card game.
Play with one Emperor card, eight Citizen cards, and one Slave card, divided into the Emperor side and the Slave side.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic of the emperor being strong to the citizens, the citizens being strong to the slaves, and the slaves being strong to the emperor.
In the movie, Kaiji plays a game of poker against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
Kaiji eventually realized that his ears were being read by a device that was destroying them like earphones attached to his ears, sending changes in pulse and body temperature, and he won by shaving his ears to the extreme and throwing off Riken River by making his body values abnormal.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from places such as Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Ryuya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaizi mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to experience the world through the game?
Taking the first step into the new year, gently pushing forward - Tora's great votive horse at the Prefectural Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
A large votive horse for the upcoming zodiac year of the Tiger has appeared at the Yamagata Prefectural Shrine (Yamagata City) as preparations for the New Year continue.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to paint the votive tablets since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine pieces of Japanese painting from the Art Department's course led by Professor Sueyoshi Tomenmei, the work of 22-year-old Yuichi Tsuchiya was selected.
The large-scale painting is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing him forward into the new year.
The sight of the tiger standing still and admiring the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, one can still have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya's design is also featured on the ema generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonenki said, "I think it will be a great help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

"Let's Think About Tamano We Want to Keep Living In" - City's Four High School Students Hold Workshop to Propose Ideas: San-Yom Digital | San-Digi
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", the raw voices of young people are compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer out loud such things as "when I'm with a lot of people and having a good time" and "when I'm drumming".
The first meeting was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns with a sense of purpose" while moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the World Cafe method.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them by sticking them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems like towns with a lot of young people would be interesting." "Public transportation like trains and buses is essential for livability."
Let's discuss further to see if there are any common points.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
The 18-year-old students from Binnami High School noticed not only the issues of the area, but also its charm, as they talked with adults about how there are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it is a nature-rich place.
The second meeting in December will be for high school students only, to organize the proposals.
We plan to announce it with the mayor and education director in February next year.
The president of the center, Higashi-e, said, "We hope to foster a sense of local attachment among high school students and provide them with an opportunity to actively participate in town development."

How to Find the New Way of Strolling (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Scarves are essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
We often hear people say that they don't quite know how to balance the scarf after they have wrapped it around themselves, while looking in the mirror.
I was wishing for a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of stoles have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
At first glance, "Can it be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece like weaving a long and narrow cloth, and the whole is in a mesh pattern.
The mesh of the net has been designed so that the edges of the mesh can be passed through.
So you can wind it up and secure it without having to join the ends together.
Lightweight and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is really interesting!
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like a raw, life-size Beatles, with a lot of freshness...
We're on the brink of breaking up so there's tension, but it's not the dramatic tension I was imagining.
While trying to keep things in order, Paul with his annoying "I know I'm annoying but come on!" attitude, George with his "But see~" grumbling, John who is always late but not very enthusiastic about it, and Ringo who is not very proactive but just sits in the back with a "Oh no~" face...
We weren't really enemies, but there was a very common feeling that it was impossible to work together anymore, which is interesting because it was the same with the Beatles - it's like a legendary breakdown or something.
And in that atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
It's crazy how a simple phrase can turn into an amazing song just by going back and forth with "What do you think of this?"
Especially the moment when the Get Buck is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle hum gradually turns into a catchy "Zu-cha♪ Zu-cha♪" and lyrics come in was recorded perfectly.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composition like this.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is sweating profusely, so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
So far it's only been one episode out of three, but so far it seems like the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
Even though the four of them would start having fun making music, when it came to the conversation of where to do the live show, the producer and the promoters would start talking in a "The Beatles are the best in the world!" kind of way, and it was easy to see that the four of them had lost control of the situation.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought it might be because Paul is supervising it, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul is quite villainous.

I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not very good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I found that I was really suited to sales activities that were requested by customers. So I switched to a different industry and found it much easier to work.
I was asked about what I couldn't do, but I think if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, it will make my life a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and relax before considering this.
I think there is also daily life, so if there is a union of the company or an industrial doctor or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there because there may be some system.
It would be nice to be able to live life with a little more ease in the future.

U.S. Hit by Unseasonable Warmth and Strong Cold Fronts as Tornadoes Strike (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
Tornadoes broke out across the southern United States from the evening of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth of the period caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, resulting in the rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the high temperatures on Thursday and Friday are expected to reach near 30°C.
With this record-breaking warmth in place, a strong cold air mass descended from the upper atmosphere at around 5500m, forming an active front due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It appears that there were successive tornadoes in the vicinity.
The American South is historically prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record-breaking number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US reported more than 400 incidents of tornadoes and gusts of wind in a single day (Friday) in local time.
This reveals two distinct, concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which indicates the intensity of a tornado, reached its peak with gusts of wind up to 70 m/s for a brief moment. EF3 is the third strongest on the 6-point scale.
Future investigations may determine that it is an EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita scale but adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
The JEF3 tornado equivalent in the US is also likely to occur in Japan and is at a level where wooden houses can collapse.

On the subject of tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) as "one of the largest tornadoes in US history" with a solemn expression.
Reported by CNN Television, among others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do whatever it takes."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the death toll could exceed 100.
Residents carry furniture and other items from a damaged house in Kentucky, which was affected by a tornado. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
The record of the tornado's damage range is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925, which affected Missouri and other states, but a meteorologist from CNN estimated that this time it was the maximum scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In the hard-hit state of Kentucky, the candle factory that was running around the clock in preparation for the Christmas rush also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were employed there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remains.
A woman trapped under a pile of rubble, unable to move, felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her in the darkness and asked for help via a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone, about 1.5 meters thick.
In the broadcasted live stream, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the sound of a woman seemingly singing "Happy Birthday To You" in tears to distract from the fear could also be heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in her basement with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, like something was erupting," he recalled.
The police officers of the Mayfield City Police Department will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, a warehouse belonging to internet retail giant Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least six confirmed deaths.
Trains have derailed from the shock of being uncoupled and highways have been blocked due to the effects of vehicle overturns.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to make more?
Consume high-protein foods and beverages.
Avoid coarsely cut raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying something can be done.
It would be great if there were "live-in work" options like hotel or resort jobs that could provide both an address and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social climate of the coronavirus pandemic.
I did a quick search and found this website↓,

There has been an old saying that different people have different opinions about star rating systems.
It is argued that while other countries deduct points from a base of five stars, Japan takes a neutral stance of three stars and adds or deducts points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a two-star difference, and four stars mean something completely different, from "has flaws" to "not a masterpiece but still good".
If you base it on a five-star system, then "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used and such operations are not given three stars (bad reviews), I understand why you would not want to give it.
So trying to argue against people who make these kinds of claims with a binary rating system on Steam won't get you very far.

Is there a USB-powered submersible pump that can accommodate a standard hose size?
The power capacity from USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, which is only 10W at most.
Depending on the water pump, it will consume at least 500W, so it is impossible.

Winding of a homemade radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitors and coils, but there was too much noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was a different radio than the one I was tuning into.
The tuning might have been too soft and not sound clear, but it was different from the expected station, right?
So here's the thing, I was supposed to make an AM radio but it seems like I'm getting FM radio instead.
Why do you think that? Is that even possible?

I understand the risks and have no plans to actually do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" "Freshly-caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento Box with Freshly-Caught Fish and Shrimp Fries and Homemade Tartar Sauce
"Hakobune" is a take-out specialty shop for colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes with plenty of vegetables.
Last August, Takayuki and Yumi (both 39) opened their restaurant with the goal of providing customers with a restaurant-like experience at home.
One of the popular bento box menu items is "Freshly-Caught Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Fries with Homemade Tartar Sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available in the market at the time.
"We make the flour as thin as possible so that you can feel the texture of the ingredients," (Mr. Kiyoshi) and the shrimp tempura has a crisp texture that can be felt directly.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of rice with mixed grains and Saga Prefecture-grown Hinohikari rice, and a soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the homemade field next door and from direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that provides a "familiar and comforting taste" (Yumi-san) that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, like rolled omelette.
The popular bento box "Hand-kneaded Domestic Beef Hamburg Steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Next year, we will also be releasing a charcuterie set of processed meats to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to be at Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I decided to try it out.
Ride Comfort Not too bad, but occasionally a bit bumpy (not enough to make you feel sick).
Naturally slow.
I felt safe because it slowed down or even completely stopped when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It's uncomfortable to be watched by people around me; it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it feels like they're intruding and it hurts.
Overall, it was not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it was a nice ride since I could take it slow and enjoy the scenery, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a thrilling ride with a futuristic feeling of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings, which is quite difficult for those who are not very patient.
I was so embarrassed.

The answer is "Nas!" (Tap to reveal the answer!)
I always thought that people who like unagi just eat it with sauce and that it doesn't really matter what kind of unagi you use, but then I realized that the texture and amount of unagi is actually quite important.

Man Cut with Knife, Escapes on Motorcycle in Saga City - Attempted Murder Incident on 12th - Saga Shimbun News - Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call reporting a "fight" from a passerby.
The man sustained a wound of approximately 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth on his left cheek, but is conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with a few acquaintances and is being investigated for some kind of traffic trouble between a pedestrian man and a man on a bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Planting Environmental Protection Activities at the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Find Asia Corporate Consultant in Hong Kong) China, with its vast landmass, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and are not only promoting environmental protection by the local government, but also encouraging the activities of environmental activists.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna) in Southwest China is also one of such regions.
Li Wenda, my sister, is currently an actress. Sipsongpanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Dai (Thai) people" who share Thai roots with the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River flows through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people in China covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet with Li Min-guo at the Seesaw Pan National Park, and hear about the environmental protection activities he is carrying out.
Starting Environmental Protection Activities with my German Husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection initiative "Tianzi" has been active since 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband came to Seychelles for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China, and he is from Germany.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and was renowned for its rich biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest took place in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
He was sent here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And that's how I met and married the journalist I was working with here.
Did Li not have any interest in conservation before then?
Li, I am from Cesar Panna but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
So she had to push the project forward without any knowledge of it.
Why do you think some people have an aura even though they don't have a particularly attractive face or a tall stature?

I'm not sure what you mean by "praise in detail" since I've never been told that before.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yoko Homma?
"My heart is blooming with joy after your confession, thank you very much" - I will accept your offer and go out with you.

[Personal Note/Troubleshooting]: MOD self-environment causing CTD, took about a month and a half to identify.
Due to lack of time to play from GW onwards, there were multiple CTDs due to various factors, and it took a long time to identify them as I could only investigate a little bit during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dlls and meshes don't leave a crash log.
Major CTD Timing
All Papyrus and .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the logging type will leave no trace in the logs.
*When accumulating kills/attacks on some NPCs: Activated even with console kill → Improved with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF *Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
Camera work for activating kill moves against some NPCs → PC kill move setting OFF via .ini for basic improvement: Conflict in settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoor) Field movement + some magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all OFF, 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Is this due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for the body mesh? Also, the default .ini for SPID usage in 2.0 has a formatting mistake, but as a result, it should have applied the prerequisite Perk to the NPC.
Initially, we focused on checking for mods related to part attacks and OnHit motions/combat (.dlls), and this is the result we got.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
I thought it might be useful to post this as a reference in case there are any other people in a Japanese environment who are having similar CTD issues.
Everyone is pretty much doing it on the edge of their mental capacity.

Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Nursing Visits - After Today's Nursing Visit
I have been receiving home care visits for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I have developed a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, it also does the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, today's home visit made me realize how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication.
Today we ended up talking about gender differences and gender theories, or something like that.
We also talk about things like sexual desire between men and women, or why she got divorced, or is it okay to talk about such things in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances about cases in psychiatric hospitals where visiting nurses, who were unable to work in the ward, came and only provided administrative support, or where an occupational therapist came for a visit but was given orders in a condescending manner, saying "We are providing medical care here".
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really great because they face me, who has a mental illness, on an equal footing and frankly.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits and those who are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, please go ahead and take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to break contracts because I could not get them to agree.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, China's one-fifth... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japanese Version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced its Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative) by 2022 and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the proliferation of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the price per kilogram of hydrogen is 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in fulfilling its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
The National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) announced on the 12th a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core materials of fuel cell vehicles, carbon fiber, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) in the global hydrogen market has been increasing at an average annual rate of 14% (since 2014).
South Korea is ranked fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative).
However, the All-Japan Council of Trade Unions reported that "in effect, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually lower-ranking among competing countries."
The country patent rankings are China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States in 2017 to become the number one, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, South Korea registered 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to become the fourth largest, but still lagging behind China (4,721 patents) at 22%.
The All-Japan Federation proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large scope of tax deductions for equipment investment and research and development expenses."

Do you get paid for volunteering?
There are some misguided people who think that volunteers must be unpaid,
There are also paid volunteer opportunities.
For example, clinical trials for drugs are usually volunteer-based with a reward of a stipend.
People often mistakenly think that it's a good byte to divide it.
Was the ratio of older sisters to wives during the Meiji to Showa period much lower than it is now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so commonplace that the phrase "sister-in-law" is being used.
Back in the day, it was said that you should look for a wife who was even older than you, so I imagine that there were more wives who were older than their husbands during the Meiji and Showa eras than there are now.

Is it a crime for a store to sell items at a higher price than the list price?
Today the PS5 was being sold at stores for 70,000.
It is lawful.
As it is a free market, for example, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and have their prices rise.
The reason why the PS5 is being sold at a high price is because of its scarcity value and its value has increased from its original price.

TV-style flyer creation, Takasu reform of the Diet in progress, "Communication Book" of the members: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition
The Town Council of Taka-su is undertaking unique council reforms such as creating an eye-catching flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate their council members.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive no-vote, with the aim of getting the townspeople interested.
To inform about the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Asa Kara Nama Gyokuro", "Tetsuko no Heya", "Sawaguchi Hito Tansaku Series"...
The flyer distributed to every household by the town council on the 9th had catchy wording reminiscent of popular TV shows.
Hyoe Katayama (43), the newly elected member of the Diet, said, "I want people to come to the Diet with a smile on their face."

US Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engage in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12th.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (approximately ¥6.8 billion), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to a Pentagon spokesman, the aid included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's buildup of forces near the Ukrainian border.
The US is on high alert over Russian military movements and is consulting with NATO member states to devise a response should Russia launch an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st of this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, state troops from Florida were sent in accordance with a multinational joint training program for Ukraine support.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational security.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, with a tense exchange of words also taking place regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make lifetime gifts a "forbidden hand" is directly targeted at Masaki Amari, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year's holidays!"
It is called "Advance Gift and Pre-Inheritance Technique".
While discussions of the integration of inheritance and gift taxes have been left out of the proposed 2022 tax reform outline, it is highly likely that in the near future, lifetime gifts, a common inheritance tax mitigation measure, will become a "forbidden hand".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Kanemaru, and a Member of the House of Representatives, we will impart everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the year-end rush of advantageous gifts.
(Edited by Keiichiro Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
"To build a tax system that is neutral in terms of the timing of asset transfers, from asset owners to urban company employees, by taking a more integrated view of inheritance and gift taxes, and to proceed with full-scale consideration of prohibiting pre-death gifts" ――.
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great stir among not only the wealthy but also the middle class.
This is because what it is saying is that it is trying to increase inheritance tax by changing the rules of inheritance and prohibiting the "king of inheritance tax measures" of lifetime gifts.
The ironclad rule for mitigating the burden of progressive inheritance taxes is to "reduce the taxable assets".
The strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used not only by the wealthy but also by employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integrating inheritance and gift taxes" emerged.
Although the December 10th announcement of the fiscal year 2021 tax reform outline was concerned with the fastest introduction, it was once again set out a policy towards unification with more detailed wording such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
Former Tax System Research Committee Chairman and former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Akinori Amano, said in an interview with this editorial department.
It is most important to not lose any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing of asset transfers and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
"Right now, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (from integration) and the fastest amendment will leave us with three chances for a pre-mortem gift."
It seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken towards invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax avoidance measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift taxes change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from midnight on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
"Photo: Kanako Yamaya as the heroine. Based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's BE・LOVE from 2018, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past."
Fumiyo Kohinata plays the protagonist, Kairi, and Hanako Yamaya plays the heroine, Rise.
Riso, a college student, meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kaili, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Risou is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but is Kairi a murderer?
Yuudai Furukawa Comment Drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
We hope those who have not yet seen FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the work by seeing the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Risae, and their struggles and changes.
We are happy if even fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

How did the players feel about winning a game with only three passes? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in this game.
This was only the second time in the past 50 years of the NFL that this had been done since the Bills recorded two passes in their Week 3 game against the New York Jets in 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had the once-in-a-lifetime talent of O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to surpass 2,000 yards in the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with Simpson and another RB, Jim Brown, in the run.
The main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border and has the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18m, and it was snowing before the game.
Bill didn't change his play selection much, being local.
Pass 30 times versus run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was never impossible.
There were four red zone penetrations in ten offensive series and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, it advanced into the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to get three points in three attempts, with one field goal.
Last-ditch defending in front of the goal in the dying minutes of the match.
The Bills committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He threw a pass at the end zone targeting TE Dorson Knox, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, Ace WR Stephon Diggs was running a slant route and was wide open in the end zone, but it didn't seem to register with Allen.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant short of the goal line, ending in a failed attempt.
Brian was covering Bill's WR Call Beasley, but he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen threw two passes to the end zone, both of which missed their intended receivers.
The fourth down may have been a foregone conclusion, but there was no need to target the TD on third down.
Get a first down in two plays.
It was still two minutes before the fourth and short, so Allen's own run should have come alive if he had made it.

Time to Throw Away and Replace: 3 Items You Tend to Keep in the Kitchen for a Long Time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as often as recommended.
Research from 2017 has shown that kitchen sponges can still be a breeding ground for bacteria, even if they are microwaved daily (though it is still recommended to do so).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has suggested that cutting boards should be replaced when they become scratched or grooved.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep clean, allowing bacteria to proliferate.
If all is still well, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry with either air or a clean paper towel, patting lightly to remove excess water.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also cause lips to be cut or drinks to spill due to missing parts.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged General Guan Yu by Builder of Forbidden
Submerged General Guan Yu: "Oi, Yu Jin!"
Forbidden "Uss".
"Yu Jin is so brave that even if three thousand arrows were to come down, he would not die."
"Ussu"
"You can't die even if you get run over by a Tiger tank."
"Ussu"
"I won't die even if I'm swallowed by the muddy waters of the Han River."
"Ussu"
"So can the water assault and underwater bridge withstand three quarters of an hour?"
"Oohs and ahhs"
"Let's practice so we can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Woo-hoo!"
Is that a promise?
"Got it!"
"You'll never know when you'll be killed by Cao Cao!"
Saying that, the general left and went back.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water assault, underwater bridge three-quarters practice! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and sink them in a cage.
Did you read the linked article properly, even though you quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community markets and trades are two different things.
The Community Market uses Steam's payment system.
This feature allows for red envelope transactions with strangers, which can lead to scams where people are left with items but no money.
That won't happen.
Trading is a feature that allows items to be exchanged or gifted as presents, but does not have a buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different topic?
I don't understand why you would think it's the same story.
There can be full-time employees for simple labor and non-regular employees for intellectual labor.
Help with FlashBIOS not finishing
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced my B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed there without blinking.
Trying to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS in case it is corrupted does not seem to work at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about five minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be that the USB memory tried is too old, or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you been sleeping too much and getting tired?
Are there any other likely causes?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?

I'm embarrassed to have branded items.
You can carry items that are not too conspicuous, but you cannot carry items with the Louis Vuitton monogram and the letters "LV" written on them.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits you.
By the way, I think it would be a good idea in Japan.
In Japan, it is ____.
That has nothing to do with it.
I should have said it earlier, "Why are you talking to me so casually/using informal language?"
If it starts to feel like it doesn't matter because you're not from here, just say it's unpleasant.
I don't think I would even dream of having an unpleasant feeling with a somewhat decent probability.
I used to live abroad and when I went out, the Japanese people, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people there and I think they misunderstood that they could say whatever they wanted to the locals.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's done without any malice, more like a kind of coddling or friendly attitude.
My friends from Europe and the US call each other by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, I sometimes get a bit confused about which one to use.
Well, it's okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just something he's doing normally, but it might be a good idea to say something now before it becomes an exception where he gets away with it because he's a layman.
Can you please speak according to Japanese rules since we are in Japan?
Observation: My white friend who is naturalizing always raises his glass higher than the younger people at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person, so that I'm not treated strangely by people younger or older than me.
Japanese people, regardless of personality, are so detail-oriented (including me) that it's annoying.

I opened Reddit today and saw that the new sub I made had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you all for subscribing!
I was actually thinking it would take a bit longer to get to 50 subscribers since yesterday we had 25, but for some reason today we got 25 more so I'm really thankful for that.

Since I only have a limited understanding of English, I will judge based on the translated text only.
I think the translated text has a bit of a strange feel to it, but it conveys the message and should be fine for playing (I'm just feeling this way, so it might be good to ask others as well).
This level of translation is often seen in games made overseas, and it feels well translated if it is a small company.
I think it takes a long time of studying for someone who is not a native Japanese speaker to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I'm not sure what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people would not feel uncomfortable with, I would suggest looking for someone else.

What would you like to do first if you visit the Kirishima hot springs?
After soaking in the hot springs, eat sashimi while drinking beer, then drink local sake while eating local cuisine.
The consideration is that training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Effort Equals Exchange" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the recent manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique is the amount of training it involves.
It is a common belief that training arcs, where there is no battle and the characters train day and night, are not popular with readers.
It can also be inferred from the fact that, even in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates separated for two years of training, only the beginning was drawn out and the rest was glossed over.
Well, one-piece dresses are one of the attractions of wandering lands, but "staying in the same place for training" doesn't always go well with them.
The training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and Giyu said to him, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, only to be forced down by the strong with sheer power...
Despite this, Yoshiyuki introduced Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains the applicants for the Demon Slayer Corps, as a demonstration of his kindness (even though he is not good at communicating his intentions).
Tanjiro's first encounter with Rengoku was when he was asked "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and Rengoku responded with a single punch, "You're too slow to decide."
It's an apparently absurd exchange between fans that has become a talking point.
But taking his sister, who has become a demon, with him carries the possibility that he will be forced to make such a judgment at some point.
It could be said that this is an initiation into practice from a mental attitude.
Rin Tazakura, a novice who has yet to undergo training, is taken to the Kamado Mountain by Urokodaki and told to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, catapults, and traps, and it seems like death awaits before one can even begin their training.
Still, with his sharp sense of smell, he can barely detect the faint scent of a trap set by a human and somehow manage to avoid it, which is barely enough to be called a "heroic correction".
Even so, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba to have Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so much more physically capable that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is just being able to use the power and skills that have been honed up to that point to their full potential.
The "Law of Equivalent Exchange" that states that one will be rewarded in proportion to the effort put in and nothing will be rewarded for no effort is a humanistic anthem that differs from the supernatural power of a god and is a difficult rule to break that is consistent throughout the work.
Is this old?
Sleeping on the floor of the house with a mattress, futon, and quilt instead of a bed.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I'm sure there are a lot of people like that.
Are you frustrated?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, not particularly.
In that case, it doesn't fit my idea of "strict".

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has established a new "DX Division" to integrate home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its CE and IM divisions into a single set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has named the division DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be seen that the aim is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly launched DX division is comprised of business units from its CE and IM divisions, including Visual Display (VD), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, Mobile eXperience (MX), and Networking.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
They also emphasized their intention to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies across the entire company and build a foundation for differentiated products and services that transcend organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through inter-device linkage such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Is 1500BCE the same as before the Common Era?

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for non-Christians, it has become more common in recent years to use BCE instead.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

This is Empire of the Undergrowth, right?
I recognize it because I supported it on Kickstarter and worked on translating it into Japanese.
Personal preference aside, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be appropriate for a natural science documentary narrated by a low-voiced man.
I would like a more heavy and formal expression.
They lie in wait, their armored heads visible above the sand, ready to spear and drag anything that stumbles into their pit.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey, showing only their disc-shaped head above the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantis lie in wait in the sand, ready to pounce on their prey at any moment, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be.
What's worrying is
Have you consulted any other documentation?
Seeing it from an ant's perspective
Is that so?
I think translating "armoured heads" as "circular heads" would make the part about "a giant beast wearing a helmet in ant-scale" disappear...
Aichi 24-Vehicle Collision: Truck Driver Has No Pre-Existing Conditions, Was It Carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no pre-existing condition and that the accident was likely caused by some form of carelessness.
At 10am on the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
Police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a first-collision accident that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The Nomura suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some kind of negligence was the cause.
The police are conducting a thorough investigation by searching the premises and gathering information about the situation at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began with three volumes, concludes with this fourth volume!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks as it focuses on only one battle!
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● The superhuman wrestling match has already begun before the match even starts!
In short, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, the mutual tug-of-war and special training scenes are quite different from before, and it doesn't lead to a match, but it's never boring.
The tension of the story gradually increasing as the century-long war is about to begin is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly a calculated production that makes one marvel at this period.
And before the big finale, we can't miss the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Aside from the extravagance of the card game, what I like is the scene before the match where Ramenman is pointing to a Kinnikuman poster and saying "From now on, I'm the one to beat!!"
Trying to chop it down.
But then a passing Terryman catches the blade in his hand, stares silently, and the scene ends with them parting without a word.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there will be no chance for them to fight against Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is a dispute over this Kinnikuman.
If I were shown this, I couldn't help but think of the distant future and its possibilities!
It is a scene that still makes me feel as a manga artist that when a character stands up, that is what it means!
The fight between the two ends without taking up much time, but the highlight of the scene is the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
"Don't underestimate the power of divine luck for Kinnikuman!"
That's what she said.
This could be seen as a grand meta-statement about the work itself, that readers have been subtly feeling that Kinnikuman will ultimately win, not because of his strength, but in some way or another, despite not having it.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei preemptively drove home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one sentence, the reader is left wondering, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman is actually going to beat Robin with his own strength?"
How do I do it?
It will also stimulate the imagination for unseen deployments in the future, and from a writer's perspective, this is like a self-imposed constraint on the creator of the work, like a set of lines.
Wow, you did an amazing job!
I'm sure this is one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Takahama-cho Nakayama, the first ever winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
The winter illuminations that began on November 26th have 50000 LED bulbs scattered along the pathways, lawns, and a 20-meter-high cedar tree. (December 12th)
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find this place here."
She said it was "very beautiful and calming".
Illumination was first planned to give people a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, the 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with button pot serving and a movie screening planned.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power to the PC for the NAS has gone out.
What happened
Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
The PC is powered on.
After a few minutes, I noticed a sound coming from my PC, like a pink rotor, so I immediately shut it down.
At this point, I assumed that the fan was just being affected by the drop in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
Not booting.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will briefly turn on and the fan will start, but will quickly stop.
He said nothing afterwards.
Try unplugging the power plug and trying again, but it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Connected only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin and removed all other parts, but still unable to boot.
I have heard a buzzing sound before, as if the fan of the PSU was hitting something, so I am suspecting that the PSU might be the cause.
I will try to find an extra ATX power supply and test it later.
Maybe.
What if it doesn't work?
Should I change the case and motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?
Where did you see it?
Is it surrounded by nature?
I live in the Tohoku region.
