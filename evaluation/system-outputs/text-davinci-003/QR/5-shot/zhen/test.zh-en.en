Students Singing the Lead Role at Zhejiang University Academic Conference - Research Results Open Up People's Minds - Xinhua News
Hand-washing with air, diagnosing diseases by sniffing, and accurately searching for sources of smog were all honoured at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, they created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor the size of half a smartphone that can be connected to a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe lightly and this instrument can detect the initial health condition of your body from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands available on the market that can detect health conditions generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-Energy Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new line of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, inventing the intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are detected too late and not cut out properly, and this has to do with the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs that enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate according to the needs of the operation and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air Handwashing: Water-Saving and Cool
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand-washing devices".
As soon as we step onto the apparatus, our weight compresses the air out of it.
"It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
"And now we can get our hands clean!"
Colorimetric and bacterial residue tests showed that handwashing by this method was as effective as conventional handwashing.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring both a high level of cleanliness and a saving of 90% of water, with no energy consumption throughout the process, making it energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the sole gold medal.

Alright, thanks.
A certificate that makes sense - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
FYI: First aid is actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency aid.
If I were to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes, the golden four minutes, to save my life!
So it's important to know first aid around you!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
"In China, we have official data that three million people die from accidents every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
Nationally in the US, 15% on average can be saved.
In the casino hotels of Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founding fathers of the First Reaction said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to have any chance of saving someone.
I find that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it's too late when something happens, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
It might even save a life!
First aid certificates can be obtained at your local Red Cross training centre; I got mine at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai, with a student discount.
PS: The last picture is of goals to be achieved before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, I plan to take a diving certificate, before I saw on Little Red Book there is also a diving first aid certificate, to take this certificate seems to have to have a first aid certificate, so in fact the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Thirteen dollars for one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried.
Why isn't #NAME# written clearly?
Thirteen dollars?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# sent me a meal with only one shrimp dumpling?!
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally believe that Four Seas is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say the movie isn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, from the kind that make you fall asleep in the theater to the kind that make you angry after watching. For the audience, Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei, able to ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting his audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like the windbreaker on Little Horse's back.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find it's just a pile of crap.
To start off, I'm having a hard time understanding some of the plot points.
The male protagonist lives on a small island somewhere in the south with his grandmother, depending on her for his livelihood.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighbourhood to take her in a small van to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people taking a bus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad were very relieved about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
How were the Island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road and the drivers of the trucks around could not be found.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a delinquent and criminally-suspected biker become a police officer?
In the movie, why didn't the person facing the usury report it to the police, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key, and then forces themselves to sleep outside the room door when they can't find the hotel manager?
This nonsensical plot was pervasive throughout the film, and I find myself in pain when I recall it due to its absurdity.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, was the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which was an ugly patchwork of nothingness.
At the beginning of the film you think it's going to be a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it could be a story about how hard it is to survive as a small-town youth, and after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep suspicion of yourself for why you went to the cinema to watch crap over the holidays.
For most people, the tropes of various types of movies are also very familiar. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romance movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(Like the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character got burned and then still managed to sing), you can't go opening some Kennedy-unbearable brain holes.
As for the female lead clearly not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I'm also quite curious as to why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file meant to give the audience a headache?

Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship Program - Students Enter as Prospective Employees of Enterprises - Xinhua News
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, that the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees be clarified, and that a three-party agreement be signed by the apprentices, the school, and the enterprise according to the principle of mutual selection. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection of the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools are to reform the model of talent cultivation.
School-enterprise joint design of talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training cycle as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. On-the-job training is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated cultivation of school-enterprise cooperation according to the principle of piloting first and then promoting from point to surface, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, increase the rate of employment and the quality of employment.

South African doctors: Omecamtiv mecarbil spreads easily but mostly causes mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omecron, is milder than that caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-strong group of doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms they are currently treating in new coronavirus patients are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but none of them require hospitalisation.
Pilley said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill if they contract the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he was treating had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported outbreak of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in the last few weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "It is still early days and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delata still being the major coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omikron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the first week of December saw a 400% increase in new cases in the Hauden province, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for over 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Times Review: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we take the famous public service advertisement "No buying, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", collective prevention and public anti-kidnapping can make kidnapping activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app, "Reunion," I feel a warmth.
The new technical means are not only named "literary" and full of feelings, but also properly used in informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of kidnapping enforcement is to locate and recover the abducted child and protect their safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But before a trafficking case is broken, the safety of the victims should be the priority.
We should set aside for careful discussion the many and varied topics of great controversy, such as "Should child trafficking be punishable by death?", and prioritize urgent matters such as rescuing trafficked children.
According to experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are known to leave the scene of the crime quickly after they have succeeded.
Every minute of delay in an abduction case increases the distance between the child and the parents and makes it harder to solve the case.
In this case, taking practical steps such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be in operation.
In order to combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Additionally, prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can still be improved.
A common example is a family of three resting at a train station, with the parents falling asleep and waking up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a reasonable level of protective awareness.
Taking turns to rest or leaving children in safe and secure environments are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of law enforcement's fight against trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years; for particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
With a high starting point and a maximum penalty, trafficking in children is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the trend of "leniency".
To this day, there are still a significant number of cases of human trafficking occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot be done solely through strict enforcement by the authorities.
If a "market" for trafficking exists, traffickers will be driven by greed and constantly innovate their methods, creating a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcement, making anti-trafficking efforts inevitably bogged down in inefficiency.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong gave speeches on the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress at Mount Malan.
Drawing strength from the Party's century-long struggle
On the morning of December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Malanshan Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, combining his own insights and personal experiences, systematically and comprehensively explained the core essence and practical requirements of the plenary session from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leaders and party theories.
He pointed out that in order to learn and integrate the spirit of the National Congress and the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping in Hunan, to enhance the ideological, political and action consciousness of defending the "two establishements" and achieving the "two maintenances", and to unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the party's hundred-year history. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the party's hundred-year struggle history, to unite closely around the party's central committee, to stay with the party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and responsibility with youth dedication.

Actually, it's not clear if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No thank you.
Yes, there has been a change of rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering of fresh olives to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
With a delightful taste and a delicate floral aroma, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavour, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and colour, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden yellow colour.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from pomace by solvent extraction.
Having seen the grading classification, you should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
It should be noted that olives, like grapes for winemaking, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best places for olive tree growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive growth, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others with similar climates, as well as far-south countries such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Months for harvesting olives:
From March to June each year is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for harvesting the fruit (freshness is key for olive oil).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representatives Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I have said before, the democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincided with "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening remarks that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to monitor the human rights situation of minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our primary task."
Rogan also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not recognised the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a video address of the "National Statement," emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interest, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down to defeat fake news.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were deemed to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions against a Chinese company deemed to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time kept getting delayed.
Originally it was to be #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I'm out of here.
No more eating.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
A diner waited for one and a half hours.
#PRS_ORG# has not been sent.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hi, the salivating chicken that the restaurant sent is raw.
I want to try tennis but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something similar at a similar price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices often correlate with friendliness, and if you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones; these "entry-level" ones are actually industrial junk.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't take it, and it's difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext behind them is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy something expensive, so let's give you a cheap one to fool you, you'll play it twice and then never play again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have progressed; then come back to me and buy the expensive stuff, and I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200. Isn't it great to enjoy a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is a letdown after the beginner stage, but most people, especially women, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salted chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# arbitrarily asked me to take it, please cancel it.
My order was for delivery, there was no option for pick-up.

I don't want food that was made an hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous wrong order.
But my car wheel cake is gone.

Actually, there are many considerations for dressing for girls who are slightly overweight.
A girl with a fuller figure should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be just above the knee, covering the fuller part of the thigh.
Skirts that are too short will reveal fat on the legs.
Being too tall gives the impression of being short and stout.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - top, skirt and long socks - in different colours, it will create a slimming effect and make you look taller.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and a noble and elegant black skirt is the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are very full, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more mainstream the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid drawing attention to your legs and feet, give the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or fishnet tights (the kind with small holes) should be worn. Choose a soft, printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the flaws of a chubby girl.
Of course, there is a certain finesse to dressing a petite girl in a short skirt.
For a plus-size girl wearing a skirt, choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will give the effect of increasing your height with your plus-size figure.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the hottest look of the summer!
If you are an MM with a top-heavy body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your assets.
A-line skirts are slimming and are better suited for plus-size girls; tops should be more fitted to create a layered look that is more slimming.
A simple white t-shirt paired with a skirt is something that even plus-sized women can try.
Petite girls can also dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls can be the focus of everyone's attention.
In addition to changes in clothing combinations, exercise more in life and strive to get out of the label of "slightly fat girl" earlier😄

Girl Used as Target for Sister's Fundraising: "It's Better Than Flesh Wounds" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but that such behavior was not to be encouraged. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl Street "Archery Target" Fundraising Warned
In the circulated photo, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "human target, ten yuan per arrow". On another board in front of her are written her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens thought this was a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers."
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and attractive clothing.
The girl who was the "human target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game, while the other girl was standing by and shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for an operation, asking for help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But since treatment still required more than 300,000 in expenses, they resorted to this behavior as a way to raise funds in the short term.
He said that throughout the whole process, two girls were present, one as the target and one as the shooter, but neither was involved; no one was seen shooting an arrow, only people watching and taking pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After police assessment by the security department, the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The spokesperson stated, "We do not advocate taking this approach to fundraising."
After being warned by the police station officers, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good Thinness: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfied Acer has always been cost-effective.
The new machine is very good.
Good performance stability, four exhaust outlets for cooling with no problems, highly recommended.
This Acer Shadow Knight laptop is great, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The Acer Predator Dragon is still not too expensive in terms of price.
I personally think the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and I can play most games with a high frame rate. My chicken dinner is stable at a high frame rate, very smooth, and LOL is no problem. CSGO is also easily handled, and most AAA games can be played.
Cooling performance: Good cooling performance, powerful fan, quiet when working, and still not small when playing with all fans on.
Appearance: Cool and stylish look. Display: Clear screen, 1080 is enough for gaming.
I'm really happy with the laptop I bought; it's mainly for design and has great value for money. It's lighter than I expected and looks better too. The red on the back is a really nice wine colour, not too flashy. It's exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth the purchase; it's also suitable for girls.
I've been using the Macro Night Knight for two years now and it's been great value for money and of good quality!
I have recommended this product to all my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
It looks good and has good configuration.
I bought something for my nephew and was planning to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit of a shame.
However, the cost performance is quite high and the logistics is quite fast, so let's come back and review it after a while.
A brand new, high value-for-money gaming laptop with a great design, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display performance: Bought for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work.
He said it was great, the one I bought for my son.
The computer is great, especially with the good customer service attitude. Ask questions if you don't understand and I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Also Win Gold Medals in the Olympics" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can be absolutely first-class in many projects, and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
A seemingly jokey article also speaks to the daily struggles of project managers, representing a sense of frustration with the current state of project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging by the increasing number of applicants for the PMP (Project Management Professional certification) each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing year by year in the past decade, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
But does passing the PMP guarantee smooth sailing for project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project dragging on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor cross-departmental assistance and communication, making it difficult for the project to move forward...
Therefore, having focused on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D personnel such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It has brought the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
The R&D Project Manager Bootcamp Online Course is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods from R&D-type enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the path of advanced project management.
It is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, resulting in efficient operational outcomes for the business.
To get an idea of what other students think of the course, here is what they say: The course is not only taught by the experts from Zhongtianhua-Xia (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many real business scenarios from well-known enterprises to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.
Is an order of shrimp dumplings only one?
Why are there six sides to a chopstick?
Before the "Double Twelve" of Sino-US Express, consumers were encouraged to consume rationally - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live streaming of goods once again made consumers shout out their benefits. On the one hand, this consumer boom made people marvel at the increasing national consumption power, on the other hand, it also had to make people calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve" festival, CreditEase Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "CreditEase") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
Elderly and young people have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to set up a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls, to promote consumers, especially young people's rational consumption awareness.
Over the years, CITIC has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, one must plan ahead and act within one's means to repay on time.

Vietnam People's Network - GCC Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the Saudi-led embargo on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely impacted the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative effect on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the US and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in the country from both countries.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of differences to restore relations with Qatar was driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is inadequate to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its aim was to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has contributed to slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures for its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust in New Town!
The car we have brought to you as a team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Priced at nearly two million ringgit, with road tax of tens of thousands of ringgit per year and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while it takes my Myvi to reach 30km/h, it takes them to reach 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Not much needs to be said about the model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, so uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool).
A kilometer of petrol costs around RM1 (drivers don't really care).
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise was so loud that you would be temporarily deafened when you got off (but it was still awesome).
The car is too big and it will be too narrow to park in a regular parking spot, I'm afraid it will get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one else on the road. (This is something I said, not the driver, haha!)
Don't be mistaken, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information you don't know, check out The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involving a car crash worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be familiar to car enthusiasts; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, foreign cars crashed a million dollar 911 and a million dollar Chiron in just a few minutes!
As it turns out, you were right!
Resonating the University Spirit with the Times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated over time in the development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been of paramount importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and global educational, technological, and talent competitions are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side," is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines," which demonstrated China's confidence and determination to move from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, it also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a shorter time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to goal confidence, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic personnel, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to realise that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its own individual strengths and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
School characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowment of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our school-running: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise cooperation, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment and Diligence" and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit of "Including rivers and seas, Opening up truth and virtue, Opening up the world and the people, and Building our country" constitute the core.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hainan Rivers and Rivers" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mentality of "using the world's talents for me"; "Qi Zhenhou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth, but also to receive moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, scientific research innovation, and also shows reform and development, and innovation; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in the same glory and disgrace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise hear without listening, the enlightened see without looking."
Chinese universities should further take root in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission shouldered by higher education in the current era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit stimulate each other, so as to realize the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and provide inexhaustible power for the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly leaving the scene, the crypto community was coming up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-raising game with a variety of playstyles, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with over $3 billion in transactions to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue is over 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The success of Axie Infinity has spread the new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts allowing players to not only gain enjoyment and economic rewards from the game, but also to participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This agency is not granted by the game makers, but is instead secured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing a news article about my friend's stock was the choice of track for the enterprise, i.e. the choice of investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics is about "doing the things right," or doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and most tactical thinking has space for strategic thinking.
Thinking beyond how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to deepen in the current field or expand into other fields (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking), one can consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); thinking beyond how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; thinking beyond how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua News
On May 23, Xinhua News Agency Washington reported that more than 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to protest the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu-Kong said that in the past decade, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria for US top universities had doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top US universities had remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have a "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yu-Kong explained that research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that, relative to the number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate of all ethnicities in these three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans after determining the facts.
They also hoped that the complained-of universities would take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian applicants.
The three universities that have been complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education declined to take action on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the appeal was joined by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In the same month, after negotiating the details of the factory purchase with the family of the property owner, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer double; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the house sale contract being delayed in signing.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, putting down a deposit, and preparing the payment, Mr. Lu was left frustrated and angry when the seller refused to sign the contract at the last minute.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court for this.
The court found, after hearing the case, that the parties had ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the fault could not be attributed solely to the defendant; it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, and thus the case should not be subject to the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract.
After the first judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
[Legal Notice] Necessary due diligence must be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the ownership information of the house and whether the house is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of false democracy, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long been a 'mass-destructive weapon' of US interference in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US over its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There were also voices of criticism internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organising the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Schulz, also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the gap between the rich and the poor becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and bulwark against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasised that democracy is not a given, "we must renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces persistent and worrying challenges".
The US side promised to launch a year-long initiative following the summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The US hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical Democracy Summit in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm afraid he sent the address wrong.
Nichang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Ambience: Average [Service Bell] Service: Quickly served My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Tang". The Mala Tang is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 Those who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
Delicious food, good meat, and friendly service.
It's been a while since I've been to Rishang, and the fruit lao is still so good & the ingredients are plentiful. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time, and it was just the soft floury southern taste I love!
The porridge was cooked to just the right degree of dryness, with a generous portion. The signature tin-foil chicken wings were as good as ever, and the soup was also good. The kale was also well-prepared...
The taste was excellent, the service was friendly, and the meat was good.
The old shop of Ritchang has been a popular spot for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden flooring.
We always had to wait a long time at the entrance for the claypot rice, and the claypot was cracked...
It's been years since I last went to eat at Richeng; the rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
Rarely do you find a restaurant with seating available right away, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The meat is good, the main dishes are great, and the taste is excellent.
Nichiyo Delivery.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three Cup Chicken: The side dishes are a bit too much, and the chicken is a bit too little.
The main seasoning of this dish is a bit off, the salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness, you can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label whisky drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and Red Label Whisky has won a gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you're wasting its smoothness.
So how do you drink Redbreast Whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from around 35 Scotch whiskies, with the full-bodied aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the full-bodied aroma.
The entry is smooth and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky entered the domestic market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Schweppes became a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acidity, can bring pleasure to the eyes, and when added to drinks, they can dilute the taste and change the flavor.
Red Label whisky + slices of lemon + cube sugar (or granulated sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly tart taste, sugar can be added to neutralize the acidity, and lemon will give the drink a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky; everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully this introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How College Exams Make Both "Geeks" and "Dummies" Happy - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and requesting that the difficulty of the exams be increased, the types of questions be changed, and that the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all walks of life with varying abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation very diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass by cramming before the exam, but if they try other methods they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there was a "strange situation" where "slackers" could pass and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "scholars" who never missed classes, had good homework and notes, and only got slightly higher scores on tests.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in their reflections on the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, kudos to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, anyone who has been to university knows that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try to get exam questions from teachers, bargain for the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets and ask teachers for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, measuring the pass or fail of an exam in a university is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
As one enters the undergraduate stage of university, specialisations begin to be broken down, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
Undoubtedly, mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic subject theory and common sense, and in terms of knowledge points, there is not much variation, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university study 20 years ago is still being studied, and is still the focus."
But the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
At many universities, examination questions are usually composed by a question-setting team, and then coordinated by senior subject teachers to form the test paper. The marking of the examination is also carried out by all the teachers who teach the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level are also needed, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of the types of questions.
Exams are the driving force of university education; whatever type of exams there are, students will have corresponding study plans, and in the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The RLU School highly values the student's suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan across the school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations for self-examination, formulate examination paper topics and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper topics and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Mechanically solving the problem of single question types and repeated questions is an issue that university examiners need to face, and of course corresponding systems need to be established. However, the effort lies in daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. Not only must they master the teaching content, but they must also understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both "academic elites" and "academic underachievers" to get what they need.
If you are unable to change my store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?
Do I not need to give any more money then?
The colleague's order has been shipped.
I can't pull it off.
What about GPS? Is it there or not?
Mrs. Kim's Bridal Photography (Nam-ro Store) does not currently have any branches.
Before taking the photos, we had to change the time twice because we hadn't arranged it properly, and our consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, a weekend with good weather was chosen for shooting.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I had ever done my makeup properly - wow, I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally check our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt happy after a day of taking photos.
When selecting photos, because I had seen many cases online, I was reluctant to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, just the 24 in the package, not one more (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked and there were two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me to retouch them.
Flipping through the photos my sister took before, I really felt satisfied with our photos; they were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I highly recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady to take wedding photos!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim thanks you sincerely for your wishes and wishes you all happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(KOTA KINABALU, 11th Dec) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of stock of special anti-fraud paper, birth certificates have not been issued to newborns since early October, with a cumulative total of 3200 affected.
However, the agency's director, Keralamunus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and would receive their certificates when the anti-counterfeit paper arrived next week.
At the press conference, he explained in response to a report by a web media that Sabah newspaper had been printed on recycled paper for a period of 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it could not be borrowed from other states.
Keralamunus revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and bring them back to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be ready for delivery to the applicants in two working days (20 December)."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From around 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they're ready.

The achievements have been made under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and achieved through the concerted efforts of the whole Party and all the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.
Practice has once again proved that it is of decisive significance for the development of the Party and the cause of the state in the new era, and for advancing the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, to uphold Comrade Xi Jinping's status as the core of the Party Central Committee and the whole Party, and to uphold the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the core of the Party Central Committee and the whole Party, with the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and with the whole Party and all the people of all ethnic groups united as one and making arduous efforts, we will certainly overcome all difficulties and create a new era of brilliance and forge new historical feats in the new journey of building a modern socialist country.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities with 48-hour nucleic acid negative and "buffer" set-up - Xinhua News.
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities recently, requiring people who have recently left port cities on the mainland border (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to port cities on the mainland border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, the notice proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
By implementing differentiated management policies in different regions, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, it is expected to achieve the goal of early containment and reduce the risk of epidemic spread, with the least social impact and the lowest social cost, to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic monitoring and warning not being timely, high-risk personnel not implementing closed-loop management, regular nucleic acid testing being merely formal, cold chain items not being disinfected in all links, centralized isolation sites not being managed properly, and epidemic emergency disposal not being scientific and accurate.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasised that port cities should synchronise their research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicise and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and proactively respond to the outstanding issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water and air ports are open, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing Truth - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a YouTube documentary titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years of bloodshed and slaughter of the innocent.
The abuse of drone strikes on civilian locations such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and the formation of death squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Pile upon pile of crimes against humanity stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" has become "the more we fight, the more terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Upon seeing the following article, why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning from a business and preservation perspective, although canning is deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder factories and interacted with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So you might be wondering: why is the shelf life of a bagged product one year, while the shelf life of a canned product is two years or longer?
Or ask: why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, out of this mentality, eat and then react saying that the taste or flavor of the canned product is different!
Now I will tell everyone why the hearing aid is expensive, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then how can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a large increase in their pricing of hearing aids to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to promote tin packaging rather than bag packaging.
And you think so many manufacturers spend hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this money come from?
As one can imagine.
As society develops, so too do the costs of marketing, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product giveaways, and advertising costs.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening devices, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose was to gain higher profits, even though their raw material costs would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to unscrupulous means and link up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, taking a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such operations, and in fact this practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any effect on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food; if the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.

Don't Scare People at the Starting Line - Xinhua News
When visiting book fairs, one often senses the popularity of success-related books.
Many of the successful self-help books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, skipping over the actually most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
As such, these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely right" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, rigid and resistant to change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word "transformation," unwilling to take the first step; or they make a sudden decision to "transform" and take the first step bravely, but often the good times don't last long and they give up soon, making it difficult to see any lasting change.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "From Tomorrow On" is a classic representation of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" approach is that it often goes beyond the capabilities of the average person, leaving most people "looking on with admiration".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to find relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it became possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes an increased chance of success.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In sum, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, but it ultimately only motivates a few; the "second-best principle" is what effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 7,100 Tons This Year - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources has increased by 7,100 tons this year to 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu," is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the Qinghai Lake watershed's "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive human hunting, the degradation of the spawning water environment of the naked carp, and other factors, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of China's Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, and the stock of Qinghai Lake naked carp has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to order food for over $180.
But the order was not deducted $20.

The restaurant only gave me one bag to put it in, it was cold outside.
Is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Wondering if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't arrived.
I just read an article about menstruation and it was too long.
A little bit of male education for the uninitiated.
Most girls experience their first period suddenly one day between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards it will come regularly every month, provided the body is healthy.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately; there's a margin of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to come earlier (sometimes several days earlier).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, so just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with 24 hours of bleeding over a few days from start to finish; the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and furniture.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but taking it after the cramps start won't be of much use.
Due to excessive uterine engorgement and prostaglandin release before labor, diarrhea is common.
If it's around the time of your period and you have sudden stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Cotton swabs do not need to be changed frequently; they should be changed every five to six hours, at most every eight hours.
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation can also make one's mood unstable, making it a bit of a bummer when the body trips itself up.
But official crime statistics show that women have a high ability to control their emotions and are not likely to use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, but also shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is at its thinnest, then gradually thickens; it can be understood as the uterus being a house, building it (the endometrium thickening) each month to prepare for a guest, if the guest doesn't come, it is all taken down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; for decades, bleeding for several days and 24 hours a month, plus abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But a person is able to be born because his mother has menstruated, which is to prepare the house for you to stay in for 10 months when you first come to this world, so everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things for women were previously suppressed, society brainwashed women to think it was dirty, shameful, and that it was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting, finds the preparation of a female body for the creation of life disgusting, and says so in public, girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and never will, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton strips, they're really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, so sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
To order an extra meal for the children.
The store hopes to check the output even in the midst of its busyness.
Does a foot bath tub tingle when it is electrically charged?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide range of products have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up, to his surprise he had discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
He later contacted the merchant, who was quite accommodating, but Mr. Li still felt disgruntled despite the return of the footbath.
Because he discovered that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the already popular foot bath in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it was suitable for, and what materials were safe to use.
Generally, footbaths do not have an electrical issue, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been released without proper inspection.
Therefore, choose a freestanding footbath when purchasing.
Hydrogen electrolysis is completely safe.
You can also take a random electric pen test.
Thirteenth Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
On the morning of December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Vice Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum for "five-color Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, and the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea expo on the spot, there are many highlights.
New-style red tea, with its infusion of tea culture connotations, is popular and in high demand, ushering in a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.
So if these foods aren't hot, can they be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental branch of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji era.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of which terms represent real existing entities and which terms represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by naturalistic concepts, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism is a research method that does not make any assumptions about the existence of God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and thinking about human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behaviour accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong actions).
It studies what kind of moral behaviour people should follow) , applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theory, but from the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, all the moral factors that prompt these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Ethical thought of humanism, represented by such figures as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical Thought of the Reformation, Represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transitional Ethics (Non-Rationalist Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is the study of the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

That's ridiculous, you're charging money for a McChicken sauce.
Have the restaurant deliver it.
I only spent so much money on takeout because I didn't want to go downstairs to buy something.
Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian aid they have provided over the past 30 years since the death of our family members, especially since I first issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the aid has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families of their own.
It was your kindness that helped our families in distress get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have been brought to a perfect conclusion long ago.
I will always remember your love and I am sure your deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in their 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds, called "Tiananmen Mothers".
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which ran for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund," which has been running ever since.
The funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations from the year of the Tiananmen Square incident, from generous individual donations, and with the support of the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Square incident.
During this time, China Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donations was out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired and not as well-off as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
Thanks and respect are due to those brave and generous comrades who have risked their lives for years to deliver humanitarian aid with open hearts.

Thank you for choosing our product. Please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following before using our chip:
Please check that all items are present and correct upon opening the box.
Please contact customer service if there are any missing items.
The cover plate on the microfluidic chip is made of PC material; do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a hand-pushed syringe to directly inject into the chip, as leakage may occur.
Standard base microfluidic chips are tested with pure water at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure prior to shipment.
Chips on glass substrates are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) inlet pressure before shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using chips on glass substrates, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution when using and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage will occur.
For microfluidic chips with a common base, we suggest a flow rate setting of below 150ul/min when using a syringe pump with pure water for sample injection, and a flow rate setting of below 50ul/min for the oil phase.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid and increase your flow rate parameters from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels of the universal chip in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for long periods of time.
No refunds or exchanges will be given if the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation.
If you need microfluidic chips that can withstand higher pressures or flow rates, contact customer service for customization.

Thank you Rabbit for your review. Originally you said that the ancient style was not suitable for ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great - I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production was impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match a makeup look suitable for your style, using only top-brand cosmetics.
As for Teacher Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio had an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats for company.
We were working in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had taken photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, and this is true for most people; photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-oiled team.
We and everyone around us were all full of praise for the finished product.
I had recommended the place to my friend and she was equally delighted after seeing the negatives.
Hoping that such studios won't be buried, that more people will discover them and shoot in their own style, not in a cookie-cutter way.
Many thanks to Jan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both are very creative newcomers and we are a creative studio. We will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
The sweet and caring assistant, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, thank you all 😘😘
Thank you for the comments from Little Universe. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you all. I'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play again if I have the chance.
How do I pay?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you're planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a great option, especially for those with weak self-discipline; training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if it is not strong enough, then the training institution is not of much use, of course some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm actually not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation, and learning this subject has a lot to do with the individual's own circumstances.
Things like profession, age, language to be learnt, and even which city, all have a bearing on what you are learning or want to pursue as a career.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer professional who has graduated, then I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time; this is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays there are many offline and online training institutions which are also very good, but they have a high cost of learning and require a lot of time to invest, usually requiring 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-learning is very convenient. There are many learning resources on the Internet now, which are free, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some classic books that can be used in conjunction with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Furthermore, many training institutions now sign employment agreements with internal referral quotas, recommending students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
These are my thoughts; as I don't know your situation, I can only give a general introduction and not a detailed one. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said I'd be there by 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.
What is meant by
I wasn't finished yet, what are you doing?

Thank you to those who silently gave me likes, life is hard but we must continue to strive for it. Life is tiring but we must keep going.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, so follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going, the road can be looked back on but not walked back on...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
As cleaners, we do the dirtiest work, but we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My Daily Work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services helps you do "clean" what I can, serve the family.
Keep the family clean, set up a family governance monument, serve in place, clean to the family.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.

Success comes from doing with heart, and refinement comes from doing with detail; we take our sewing seriously.
Give me a chance and I will make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is to be trusted, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough out there in all industries right now!
But I always believed that as long as I had the right attitude, was persistent and worked hard, I would be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day well begun is half done; all good things start in the morning. May you start the new day with joy, luck, health, and good fortune. Have a good day and keep a good mood all day. Good morning!
As a child, happiness was something to have; as an adult, happiness was a goal to reach; as a mature person, happiness was found to be a state of mind to be understood.
Be the truest and best version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life to the fullest!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese curators join hands to hold the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News
The Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is co-curated by the Saudi Art Council and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with UCCA Director Fei Tienyu serving as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial is "feeling one's way across a stone bridge," which is a metaphor for the reform strategies taken during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennial covers nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones Across the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Peripheral Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Of these, works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, encompassing a variety of forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; works by 12 Chinese artists were also highly acclaimed, with some artists creating works in a novel way using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's The Endless Landscape Series Behind the Story (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Barakat, CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, expressed the hope that this Biennial would establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's burgeoning cultural industries and creative communities, and to strengthen interactions.
Fei Yu said: "The biennial's aim is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to enable Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period, with artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industries discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help promote rural revitalization comprehensively.
According to a relevant official from the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income through employment, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of post development settings, the new regulations clearly stipulate that post settings should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "post setting on demand, personnel based on post, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-job training and arrangement for work.
In addition, the new regulations also specified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and required the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; and required the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I reorder.
Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wing has had successful periods in history, they have not lasted long; they are like flowers that bloom in the sun and sweat when given a sip of water; they are easily elated when successful and quickly discouraged when faced with defeat.
But realistically, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of government and protecting human rights should not be denied.
For me, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I take his words seriously and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I opposed his anti-communist theories, as I believed that anti-necessity revolutions would inevitably lead to social unrest, harm the people's livelihood, and a mix of political groups, followed by foreign powers taking advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people; those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists are actually a bunch of outcasts from the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyse their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with anti-rebels and refuting Leftists, and they were quite emotional. I think there's no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics; they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the anti-revolutionaries and the left-wingers to admit it - why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent piece and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them so obsessively that they become distorted.
As ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth may become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom; China's innate historical and cultural genes lead to the overall tendency of leaning left in China.
The right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness and security.
Now society as a whole is looking for more fairness, and the Sino-US rivalry is definitely leaning left, likely to continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up and be done with it.
Without saying a word, Flower-Flower was so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US's suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries to impose a blockade on our chip industry, has directly resulted in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and phone prices rising, with almost all industries using chips suffering the consequences.
In order to gain control of the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to form a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US technology giants, such as Intel, an old American technology giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Investing $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opening up chip contract manufacturing business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to snatch away TSMC's "rice bowl".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is sure to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Intel's decision was met with disdain by TSMC founder Morris Chang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was so dismissive of Intel's foray into the semiconductor field because he still harbored resentment from the feud between TSMC and Intel over 30 years ago.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of American manufacturing, occupying the pinnacle of the global market and dominating the world semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chips designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model put a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs had to back away from the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to see division of labour and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specialising in chip design, he thought that since there were companies specialising in design, then it would be possible to set up a factory specialising in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
TSMC targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing," providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time, newly-founded TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognised that Intel had a disdain for semiconductor fabrication services at the time.
Surprisingly, the giants that once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel was entering the semiconductor foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
No more waiting.
I placed the order two hours ago at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some weird trending topics today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Good Friends Price Increase, Huolala Incident, public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [index decreases] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look identical to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China had previously displayed.
What is abnormal sentiment?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, a [solitary peak], [sawtooth], and [cliff] shape is presented.
"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to get into the hot search list and attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in a single glance: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuned operations, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Public relations is a science, and without taking into account any subjective factors such as position or emotion, it is impossible to hide from the objective data.
Everyone leaves a trace, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries first discovered cases of infection with the Omicronon strain - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12th: According to reports from Xinhua's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain on the 10th day.
According to Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other was a local resident who tested positive for the virus on 30 November after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons both turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cypriot Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the virus.
The three individuals are students who returned from overseas travel earlier this month and, as they were all mild cases, were not hospitalised.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of Sei is increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 and over arriving by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The health ministry conducted genome sequencing on 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and identified the three cases of infection.
Takeout never arrived.

I don't think this will help at all!
Received with money belly.
The order is for a phoenix claw.
Alright, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff to explain.
Your rider told me the address was too far.
Great Beauty 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, 156 Huan Cheng Nan Road
Initially it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as they arrived at the store.
When I first went to the store, I just showed them my floor plan and they didn't even measure the house. They were able to give me a quote of 70,000 for my 135 sqm house. They showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that they will drag you into the store and make you pay a deposit (which you will never get back unless you have enough experience to fight them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This was a big scam and I was a living example of being duped, paying a deposit of more than ten thousand in a moment of impulse.
His quote to me had a lot of issues - 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, didn't include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to get my money back they were very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
The customers are in no way to blame for the problem of biting down no matter what.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and a lot of details, don't want to say all are tears, in short don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees afterwards.
Damn, they were the original scamming head decorations, now they changed to Da Mei, it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decorating company.
In the future, everyone should do more research and consult more when choosing, because decorating is not a small expense.
To ask a merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Posting of any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited; please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then, if you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The salivary chicken should have been cooked, but the one received was raw and inedible.
Sky About | Gemini Meteor Shower 14th to Welcome Maximum - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not to be "nurtured" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularisation expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of activity, and is one of the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantids and the Perseids.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, colourful, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Geminids meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th this year, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Chart.
"Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression with its 'falling petals', but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be hampered by moonlight, so the spectacle won't be as impressive.
On the 14th, the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight after the moon sets, but be sure to dress warmly.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but rather to choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a clear view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets to observe visually."
It should be noted that the Twin Meteor Shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to keep looking at the radiant point of the Twin Meteor Shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter release cables are also essential for stability and continuity considerations.
Xu Li-peng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television the OP mentioned should refer to LCD TVs, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or rather, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting user demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales for 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, the sales of laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The success of laser TVs in the big-screen market is mainly due to their excellent performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The CECST Standardization Research Institute's SaeXi Laboratory and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In an increasingly vision-conscious world, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye-protection advantages, but have also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
That makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, laser TVs have a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection equipment, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with minimal space needed and a small, compact host that takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, top-brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less wear and tear on the equipment, and longer life of the television.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, in terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, microstructured FEP screens are used, at a high cost; an 80-inch one is basically the price of a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing I really hate is when projector manufacturers use "good for the eyes" as a selling point for diffusion. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling lit up too?
Furthermore, the projection screen fabric would not be able to form an image if it were not diffusely reflective.
It was precisely the hot-spot (glare) effect of the high-gain screen that was overlooked, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that was really uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Select Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding her on WeChat to book a date, the lady sent me a list of available times and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the shop's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling~ The photographer would arrange some props, guide the actions, and be very meticulous about the details before taking the photos.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should look nice 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the post-production style, and feel very attentive.
It will take about half a month to fix the film, so wait and see the results~
I won the second photography-themed grand prize event~ most of the clothes in the venue could be chosen for a photo shoot.
She finally chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer was my younger brother from the post-95s generation, who felt a bit inexperienced. I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
The Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores for reply.
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too!
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose the clothes, including wedding dresses. They were very patient when I tried on three or four sets. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, when taking photos, they taught me how to pose. The only problem was that the photos made my face look too big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received them in three or four days and there was no difference from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are about three makeup positions inside the photography studio.
The service was very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also teach you poses very seriously.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
Experience: The shaping may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
Eyebrows were also shaved off, which was a bit awkward for daily life without eyebrows.
The photos were given ten days later, but the effect of the double eyelid stickers was not very satisfactory, it still felt very obvious.
Not sure what style to go for, I tried two sets, but in the end I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and the editor said he would have the finished product within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfying~
No response for 3 days...I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan as your system is unable to recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violation records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent; in summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) for insurance companies and banks, and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Rain Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Rain Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it is still good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel salaries, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
It is worth considering.
In terms of professionalism of the salesperson: this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims issues and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Weibao" (like Little Umbrella, an internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsibly telling everyone.
Insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners in the internet channel, and there is a lot of sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
The insurance company paid out 6 million (a world of free money) for a one-dollar bet.
Free mobile phones were only given to policy numbers with special endings such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message was sent out, no one would remind you to redeem it if you didn't.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term, if only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if a serious illness really occurs, 60,000 can do what, can not solve the problem, the future life begins to be naked.
Misleading internet insurance sales are currently being cracked down on by the government.
So, overall, the platform is fine, the product is fine, it's the professionalism and professional conduct of the salespeople that is the issue.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully, as many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for customers. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Growing with each customer for life.
I hope my answer was helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although taking out insurance online may lack the "ceremony" of it, and may not even involve a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal force of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat akin to a "telephone sales" assembly line approach, can have a fatal flaw when it comes to buying insurance: follow-up service may not keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, so when we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider if the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver the goods.
But the rider left it at the door, and then the person left.
That's wrong too.
Your rider has picked up my takeout order at #NUMBER# but is still telling me it is pending.
The delivery rider had received my takeout at 19:25 but still refused to leave.
Did you want anything else for takeout after I buy this?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'm calling the police.
But my food could have safety and hygiene issues.

Redeeming the promo code is all that is needed.
No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate anything, but this kind of villainy must be stopped.
If we set aside party and faction, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to the posts with sarcastic comments, to your attempts to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me in a subtle and humiliating way on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether to plant strawberries in bed or not. I... just forget it.
Later I received messages from several friends about your Facebook account with a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment content.
Sorry, as a woman I can no longer stay silent.
After my news report was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your making of the picture or continue to post all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, and do not have the power to stop you.
I neither know nor want to know you, and my looks and figure do not need your criticism.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those without basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I have cut some of the comments for everyone to review.
No one should be able to impersonate you on posts you make yourself.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Break into a smile.

Unacceptable.

Why remake it?
That's outrageous.

Yangtze River Mainstream Achieves Full Coverage of Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
Thus far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had already built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognised by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River Green Shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities have been significantly improved.
It is reported that the Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and sailors, helping them to solve the "urgent distress and longing" problem.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. The realization of "one-time mooring and multiple services" in the port will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Strongest Weapon Rarely Visits Guam - Multi-dimensional Chinese Communist Media Multi-dimensional Report: Latest news on US-China relations: Latest satellite images show three US carriers gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visits Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform," a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9th.
The Balabac Strait, connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic stronghold in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea aboard the USS Carl Vinson.
This was the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
The US Navy carrier currently cruising the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried the first F-35C carrier squadron, belonging to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser USS Shoup, the missile destroyer USS Stockdale, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing three US aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Rare Visit to Guam with Most Powerful Weapons On January 17, 2022, US Navy carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception).
The USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base at Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
US Three-Carrier Strike Group Makes Rare Visit to Guam Around China - Analysts Say It Sends a Signal to Allies and Enemies in Increasingly Tense India-Pacific Region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US Three-Carrier Strike Group Makes Rare Visit to Guam Near China, With Most Powerful Weapons - China has been building up a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the "Boomers" the "most important survivable leg of the nuclear triad," which also included launch silos for ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that could carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, with a market cap evaporating of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that they are "facing unprecedented competition," what could be the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue primarily coming from advertising. It is a money-making advertising company today, with its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, whatever the functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustments to its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow an app to access their information; most people's normal reaction would be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it is there).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta receives at least 10% of its revenue annually from China, mainly from companies doing business in the country.
Meta has around a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets often find that Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, burning most of their money on Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte just two years ago.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale is now over.
Third, the expansion of new channels of traffic was not successful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets look not only at current income but also at future expectations.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were not met.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "metaverse".
The metaverse should certainly be a direction of the future, but the realization of the metaverse is a longer-term story that is unlikely to support Meta's valuation over the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success and annual revenues of $10-20 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at the company, with no real safe harbour compared to other internet and tech companies.
Although his several social media apps now have high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand unified universe was so far out of reach that success in the short term was completely out of the question, making Facebook a very risky venture. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues was wrong and was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
