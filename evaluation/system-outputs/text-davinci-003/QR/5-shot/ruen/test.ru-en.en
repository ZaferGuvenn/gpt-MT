From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac-age women based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
The psychology and suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105x195.
Model "Micro-Pack Prestige": Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - by a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is well ventilated naturally, as is coir coconut.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area.
Also, an extended warranty period applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but the mattress's service life is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover, supplied as standard.
Purchase a orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress – it is recommended to maintain an optimal position of the spine while sleeping.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrei, it has been clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in a team line.
The computer teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught that, the school kids are playing Windows games.
So there is no support.
I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the doorstep, and cutlets are still sizzling on the stove, mother in a flurry is mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
Then mop the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning afterwards.
And the guests?
They are doing well, and they brought a cake too.
Ever since then I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I make them delicious treats, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Vaccination Against Coronavirus is Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
This is the conviction of the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11th by Die Welt.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required by the summer, at the latest in the fall," says the expert.
Furthermore, Wiegelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron".
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
So, the likelihood of re-infection with "Omikron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
The company stresses that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging for an acceleration of vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, as Zalzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling in this regard," the expert underscored.
Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib 54 Silent 54mm 8.5g Wobblers.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for bottom fishing, not just for casting.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper frets made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when playing vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is a simple monotonous one, that is, a movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
Furthermore, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for sea bass and large perch, especially in mid-winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib trolling can provoke a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait.
When casting Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or roach by casting, besides a uniform retrieve, a "step" retrieve is sometimes used, with a "tickling" of the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch the treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class of lures, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, as a result, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12th, by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from Wagner PMC in Libya."
They have airplanes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
"They have 30 fighter jets at the airbase in Gürdabı (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are trying to seize the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy assets.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not registered in any military or legal registries, and its fighters are not listed in personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind you that earlier the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de-facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Policy Through the Eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "Protected and restored peace in Syria", "Decision on the "Nord Stream-2"", "Frightened the whole world with tough weapons", "We took away Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - is stated in the research of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai Government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have also become digital only.
The Government of Dubai announced a complete abandonment of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the start of a new stage of digitalisation of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation touched all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
That's already a cliché about birth dates and how old the child is, and also about the class and group in kindergarten.

Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the 2020 level.
Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply declined in November amid devaluation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November in Turkey 115 thousand cars were released from the factories, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive dynamic compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 MSB entities have received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium business, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State from April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses" on April 9, 2021," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the order of granting deferment of loan payments provided for granting by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, deferment of payments on credits issued to MSB subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's statement may have indicated a different deferment period for payments.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and enforcement activities, notification of overdue debt repayment, and collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, applications for payment deferral on loans were received by second-level banks from 603 borrowers-SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received deferral for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
"MFO has received applications for deferment from 131 MSB subjects, of which deferment was granted to 95 subjects for the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily transmit the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" strain of coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation it encountered no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, it became very rapid.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than usual, their antibodies weren't cut back during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when the young people of 30 years old die, while the old people of 60 years old pass it off as a sneeze.
The immune response of the young man was completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he was shooting like a gun at sparrows - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of an emerging problem.
Meanwhile in Russia, by the end of the year they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist and head of the Genomic Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from the coronavirus.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum amount of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarteners - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genome engineering at MIPT.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid.
The authors of the study examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin named the causes of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of WHO diseases, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities requiring the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year at the Bible Museum in Washington, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
The department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the experts "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector reported that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4th, where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artifact was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the form of the sun god Amun, has been held in a private collection and not put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively striving for the repatriation of illegally exported antiquities from the country in different times in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) - is an independent people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business matters with colleagues or clients.
The Bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have shifted to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse officially does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is outside of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is a loner, yet is well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
The main success was that at the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern-day poet has been honored with such distinction as Sergei Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - the contract provided for 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the plant director received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and had to set up a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly painted in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind whistling?
Over the empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September
Alcohol is brain-numbing.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had deteriorated, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
Increasingly frequent bouts of depression and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Aleksandrovich, there are no reliable documents left.
Say, related to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, was treated in a clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Gannushkin (Esenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
And here is evidence of the poet's brawls, scandals on this soil, and arrests by the police - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
From the early 20's the poet's terrible romance with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed briefly with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing neither in Moscow nor in St. Petersburg, he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
"He would only come to sleep, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
Coming to himself, he began to cough incessantly, spattering the whole sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself after his travels around Europe and the USA (at the time there was a prohibition law in the States, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm already at the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because sorrow gnawed at me.

Now my son is almost 16 and he no longer has any desire to smoke.
All his energy is directed towards choosing what he will make a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband who had occasional run-ins with the law before our wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely love".
Why did the girl cry on the exam even though she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons".
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also convinced that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many points of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk in response imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Velvet jackets were the dominant fashion at 2021 social events.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
At the premiere of the movie "No Time To Die" in September, he appeared in a velvet raspberry blazer and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was tried on by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to the analytics service reported to "Gazeta.Ru", their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury velvet blazer segment this season, almost all brands are represented - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, in which ambassador of the brand Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin from Lamoda warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to consider when choosing a velvet blazer is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should have the right advanced company with enough money," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel". - Owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday items will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who organize this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If the rank of the employee is lower and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will precisely assess the phrase "not according to Senka's hat", - editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so rehearsed it drags.
And not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of the people around.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion Dollar Investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy sources are also not in surplus - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A drop of a penny.
And who is in the flight then?
As usual - a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about Native American issues?
Therefore, it is not fair to consider Western politicians as idiots who have "missed" the energy crisis.
They have done their job.
For a good deed.
Didn't see any beautiful people in the pictures in the article.
Mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they won't sit next to them, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not recognize his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life, is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he voluntarily describes the beauties of slave life and extols a kind and good master is a flatterer and a hypocrite.
The immunologist stated that vaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination within four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Under the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign to take up revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two doses and a booster, or they have had the disease and been vaccinated, or been vaccinated and then had the disease, then they have a 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "massive consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the "G7" (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, United States, France and Japan) released a statement following the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" to Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement reads.
The ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the foreign ministers of the “Big Seven” also declare.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation for our mutual and comprehensive response," is also stated in the statement.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron-strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omega-strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other strains.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant,” Professor Malik Peiris said.
The scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course in case of coronavirus infection.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omicron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omikron-strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
Ukraine's Minister of Defense, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12th, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the USA, the UK, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky declared that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
In Ukraine it is expected that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense", added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.
Sergei NOSOV 2, no, poor vision has nothing to do with it.

Years... a long time ago I did the same remodeling.
Combined living room with kitchen.
The apartment is three-room.
It was.
Of course, the project, the permit, the new technical passport, all according to the law.
They made a bookcase in the hallway and a large wardrobe.

Mistake - a steep shower cabin was installed instead of a bathtub.

Thank you for the recipe.
What kind of apples do I need for this recipe?
This is really delicious.
I add some chopped onion and a green apple to it.
Try it.

But besides hatred, gossip, and scandals there is nothing special to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she lived a life in bitterness.

Revealed ways to get stolen money back from online stores.
There are several ways to get money stolen through online stores back and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
This was revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"Under the rules established by the payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, highlighted that the buyer has the right to file a statement to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Furthermore, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19th, member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be urging Schulz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravcsek, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disputes.
The European Court has fined Poland for establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on any public commitments to stop the "Nord Stream-2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt a gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional staffer said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
Those who are unfamiliar with the initial layout are the ones who doubt.
And I know these apartments very well and can perfectly see how it was redesigned.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when they write about the means to clean the sink, toilet, windowsills, taps.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something, that you have to literally wash off.
Just don't litter.
Mintz wants to give writers residencies.
The future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers will be given federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
On its basis, writing residencies will be created, the Ministry of Culture informed the Parliamentary Gazette, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing a project of a presidential decree on the creation of a Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be entrusted to take care of, among other things, the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Litfond.
"A significant number of immovable property objects, previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR, have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writers' village of Peredolkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad Region and others," the press service of the Ministry of Culture told the Parliamentary Newspaper.
The project charter stipulates in the Fund's charter that it "is created for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
"Creating conditions for creative activity" implies creating writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," explained to our publication in the Ministry of Culture.

Doctors have warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before coronavirus vaccination.

She reported that there is a current epidemic of people taking anticoagulants for long periods of time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific supervisor of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev in an interview with URA.RU said that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants randomly and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the internet and beginning to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And upon preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He donated the find to the church and, according to him, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.'
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the discovery is linked to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount as the award's validity period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive twenty thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her utterances, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person".

There are people richer than her, but not all of them act so brazenly, so provocatively, like this madam.

Also included in the list of exceptions are those who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barrozo noted.
Previously, the authorities of Brazil have required unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Merited Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and applying a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
After vaccination, we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies) inside.
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help those that in such a case the body's defense, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseinov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture that is seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who has been gone for a long time now) like this - if you're willing to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But the sparrow was trained and generally smart.
I chose my company and went home.
A video method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not just pulled out of thin air, believe it.
I had to stop many owners from running after their dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand were running away (in Pomsk), I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
From February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's policies in healthcare, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held up signs that read "This is a false pandemic", "I will not vaccinate".
A large protest rally against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of several regions of the country was taken against the backdrop of an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
The group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kshevakova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.

I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans only bring death and plunder to any country they appear in.

WHO has already detected the "omicron" in sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was reported in a WHO statement.
According to the organization, by December 9th the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite it only becoming actively spread since the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of transmission of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Before this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omikron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of those infected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people in the Kingdom currently suffering from the "micronom", and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at its peak hospitals will be taking in more than 2,000 people daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is further complicated by recent studies showing that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.

Curious Bunny, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, it is easy and relaxed to communicate, but when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
And to see the person live, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't catch - hence the attitude.
When you meet your person, then your views will change.
Again, the Soviet era is referred to as "the time of the beasts".
Yes, then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And were raised practically according to God's laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

Our St. Petersburg, or more precisely Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain warm relations of the older generation.
Maybe it was related to the fact that there were no lodgers in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing each other more and more at funerals.
Lara Angel, throw it away!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, fussy, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
Too bad they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but no bumper cars!
And what for?
Did Brother push too hard without calculating the strength?

$135 billion went into Hi-Tech applications.
In 2021, user spending in apps worldwide grew by 25%, while downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most time on YouTube.
The number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly, user spending in apps grew by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to physical' slow down the growth of app economy? Not at all," say the authors of the report.
India has become the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
Following them are the USA (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
Following it are two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, among users popular VPN services (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are in the top 10).
"Users spent the most in apps for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report noted.
YouTube leads here, in the top-5 of user spending also included video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.

People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be called one of the main takeaways.
"The industries that helped people stay connected virtually and personally have seen the most success," commented Lexi Sydow, head of marketing insights at App Annie, on the report's results.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have no or almost no plot and minimal video presentation.
The top 3 most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Previously App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director, Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious hacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Varonis’s leading system engineer, Alexander Vetkol, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It's a province but THERE WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women painted and showed off their henna tattoos.

There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions are listed that will help to prevent diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some don't give this much importance, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only an improper diet but also habits can contribute to the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of the worsening of well-being after working days is often "weekend migraine", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific supervisor of the clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, this is especially common among hard-working people who experience headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are enough objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change of conditions.
On weekends our life changes fundamentally.
"Sleep longer, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "A small breakdown starts due to lack of coffee."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation".
Late rising plays an additional role.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jetlag will occur.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection," the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the Omikron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under unfamiliar words in the product composition may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may present several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates which belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonised economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future as well, as it currently has an important role in the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the US had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not comply with the requirements" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked Twitter of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It has been reported that India has allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
The Modo office asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister stated that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12th, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's inhabitants voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, a total of more than 80,000 inhabitants of New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence called on voters to abstain from voting.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists have stated, they do not recognize the results of the last election and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, President of France Emmanuel Macron is set to address the results of the referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has been a major focus of the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated on numerous occasions.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valery Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position because "it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be a choice of France".
Hi, Sveta!
I have embarrassed you a little... a lot, still awkward, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

But as an artist - not an artist at all: what can be changed here?

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the US.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of the relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a number of insulting remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite in a front against Russia".

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant they will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11th by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," he is quoted by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that these are reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this new generation of drones surpasses Bayraktar in all characteristics.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant by the end of the next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in Donbas.
On December 6th, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is intending to use drones.
On September 29th, Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev Oblast for training personnel, as well as testing and servicing Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions have escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions settled on the roof of a container.
The animals could not move away from him due to the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranqulizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Experts have warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Research suggests that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folate, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express publication.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take Vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to be sure to watch the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is contained in avocados, among other things, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April due to the Omikron strain, up to 75,000 people may die.
Forecasts from British scientists show that up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months due to the spread of the mutant strain of coronavirus if restrictive measures are not tightened over the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies of the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25,000 deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the illness, hospitals will be receiving more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Strict measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overwhelmed if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the speed of the Omikron-strain spread remains at its current level, by the end of the year the country will have around 1 million cases of infection.
By the middle of December, the Omikron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently in the UK 1898 cases of the OMICRON strain of coronavirus have been detected, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On the same day, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown in the world by a quarter.
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking world records despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the global ship registry was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars and more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a frenzy in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas before all these people would go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and hold negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the wealthy and call it decadent.
Rich people, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of deprivation, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause resentment in society, as the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement this.
Meanwhile, not only the number of super-yachts ordered impresses, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of the keel over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads have become commonplace, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the McGregor fighter's yacht, a platform for martial arts. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning if we consider that there are slightly more than 2000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of an average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trace was attributed to his 162.5 meter long yacht, Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to sail the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't evoke much sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there's no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her exhortation to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol consumption per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't realize how intelligent four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence develops.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, have no understanding of politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade between the US and Russia.
The US and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue talks in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate but just send away the one offering it.
"Trade is looming in relation to Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are done secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and deploy counteraction forces," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Expo held in the city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province/Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with data technologies that will ensure increased reliability and operational performance of rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first domestically developed two-story high-speed electric trains for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will be running on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of railway equipment is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yao, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaojiang.
After more than 60 years of intense work, carrying out a series of independent research and development, China has created a leading system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yao-shan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about hearing loss being both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, medical professionals do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help to study foreign languages and actively communicate.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking," said Golosheikin.
Previously, a charity for dementia research in the UK has stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad.
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian Ombudsman, to journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and variability of character," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7th, Saakashvili began to boycott receiving medical assistance after personnel from the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports are also required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, over 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
Restrictions for unvaccinated people are also planned to be introduced in Russia.
The government submitted a bill on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a history of the disease, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be set for train and plane journeys.

Steep Climb: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, allowing the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taiwu in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, however only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including in Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main goal for the long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizing Adviser, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the serious changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, eateries serving national cuisine are opening.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO has stated.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In recognition of the 12th of December International Universal Health Coverage Day, WHO and WBG have published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and more than four billion people have virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister Cut Off From Broadcast at 'Summit for Democracy' at White House Request
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the summit's recording on YouTube.
Reuters Agency citing sources claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked on it green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red, as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, chief editor of "Novaya Gazeta" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

SKETCHES OF A VILLAGE MOSKVICH.
Don't lump them all together - bad people exist, you may have specific grievances against them...
But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on?
Write that they are "scoundrels, didn't return the money".
It's none of your business how many and when they have children, until they come to hang them around your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education like that...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this will apply to other areas of life, court proceedings and so on?
For them, the laws are not written.
What if Dad does implement his own method of upbringing and education?
Such a horror and a bad example for others.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day that the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
Furthermore, it is noted that cities hosting land border crossing points and meeting certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
The Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with "Izvestia" assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that a long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some kind of improvement in relations, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with both the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is being made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal preparation against COVID outside the hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Setting up points for administering the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would only do this initially in medical facilities.
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is there, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centers will be possible when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

It is said that true believers make up the church.
Whether there are truly believers or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would wish to be truly believing, and each strives to be so.
But no one should speak of themselves or of those who believe as he does that they alone are truly believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then so can others.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omikron-strain of the coronavirus have been recorded in a day - RT in Russian.
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new omikron-strain of coronavirus have been identified in the last 24 hours.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3137.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April due to an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "Omicron" strain, up to 75,000 people may die.
Peskov warned of the sufferings of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose sanctions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said an official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It has been previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Furthermore, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank head German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12th.
96.5% of those who voted were in favor of independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of ballots.
The turnout for voting on this day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to abstain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the "omega" strain is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
There is also data suggesting a decrease in vaccine efficacy against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary estimates from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "Delta", - says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
Meanwhile, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron-strain have been registered in Russia.
They "had previously been immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The Head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky.
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, December 12th, in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option which Denisenko called "the ideal storm" suggests that Ukraine will stop being supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices of key commodities that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and resistance to the government from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)", added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting of power", added Denisenko.
Another scenario - transforming Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This can be brought about by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
It was noted in Moscow that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11th, data from a survey conducted by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming Ukrainian presidential elections, only 21.8% of the votes would be cast for Zelensky, while 14.5% would be cast for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
Among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very saddening to learn that.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, it was a live broadcast for us residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions were soaring, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in other victories, such as cheering for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I once saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there they were rolling watermelons onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I'm buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the shoulder strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated through the festoon along the décolleté and under the bust.
Vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from curling up on larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was nasty and venomous.

Arrested for the rally at Red Square, the poet said: "For quoting Yevtushenko they give 10 days, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was detained at Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetforrussiaismorethanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol for an administrative article on a repeated violation of the order of conducting a public action.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his poem.
How were you treated by the police officers during this and previous arrests?
What were people asking in the department about your promotion?
This time the staff were more courteous, the detention was maximally polite, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
The OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
Asked the standard, about the motives.
When heard, basically looked at if not approvingly, then understanding.
Except for the four-way ventilated monkey suit, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action under this hashtag people start writing their own poems, at least a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Max, according to the protocol, talk in private even in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone understands what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more, incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and yet still relies on a translator.
And at official events stenography is still done by hand, and the stenographer does not have to know multiple languages.

Researchers have revealed how potatoes can help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help to function the systems of the organism.
Additionally, potatoes help in fighting age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of potassium, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or stewed rather than fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes may be dangerous for diabetics, as with other high glycemic index products.
These are products with carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current product deficit can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Candidates for Departure
In 2015, the right holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Calamari" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is what is called a bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.

Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190.
Orthopedic Spring Mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product is made up of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micro-package" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are used for the sleeping area, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micro-Package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is laid with latex, then the other is laid with coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic status, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If a coil provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Cover: The model comes with a stretchy Aloe Vera fabric cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
Overall height of the product is 27 cm, recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and Security: Warranty Period – 3 Years.
The mattress has obtained all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has the CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will be searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "Actual Camera".
The goal of the five-year missions launching soon is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus is to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
"If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Payusalu.

Metaverse will change Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will be investing in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
Meta-universes should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy and unhealthy anymore.

You can have a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
Ahead are indeed ten days off, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the tide.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has already run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates taking into account inflation would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Furthermore, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Previously, the head of the Global Research Department at "Otkrytiye Investment" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, however the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar course, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the FRS, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
Over the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To put it into perspective - roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in last September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
In the 10 months of this year he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
The related Kia brand of Hyundai has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions this brand and by increasing the average car price - for the year at Hyundai it grew almost by 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the price increase was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not grown so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automakers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia realized in quantitative terms 9.4% more cars over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average weighted price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) have grown for the German premium brand.
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing a good growth in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is leading to a greater financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
According to sales growth, Chinese brands have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year, showing fantastic figures.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies whose sales of cars in units in 2021 have fallen are financially sound: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amidst the supply issues of auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Automakers regularly revise prices on their products and other automakers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of car deficit, I think that many car manufacturers even managed to partially shift the costs of previous periods onto the consumer, which they could not include in the car price before.
Says analyst of VTB Capital for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that in terms of finances, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, sustaining a high margin of sales".
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices which have been observed throughout 2021, with prices for new cars rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in supply, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, manufacturers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
An increase in the production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, an expert notes.
Biden spoke about the redeployment of US military to Ukraine in case of a Russian invasion.
The US government has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
Such was the statement made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
"There were never such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - said Biden.
Previously, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
He also noted that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
