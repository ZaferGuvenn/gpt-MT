The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Frankly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder the order for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a look, just help out, just bring the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it's OK with him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately forces the patients to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the general plot and I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson to push for booster vaccinations
New Omikron cases are constantly causing concern for politics and science in the UK.
By New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned, in view of rapidly increasing Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
I received an invitation to a meeting via email today.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Tried first on #PRS_ORG#.
But that's been working for about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
They are now available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, and an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But that didn't settle after the game - it increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the result itself was the manner of the performance.
To illustrate the dilemma, here is a statistic: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were just not focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't execute what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like performing in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted with legal counsel and have written to them again as a result.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Always looking sharp: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up their dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020. dpa
Hi #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new housing will be created through expropriation.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to decide how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hi, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it when I place the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the USA.
More than 100 deaths could be mourned in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it shipped to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing their slogans.
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He changed to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with First Campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the further action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the option to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Negotiating, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears will stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the returns sent over so I can package up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing over the season, so I'm making this post to vent a bit.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start crash put the schedule far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!)
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
In addition, there are constant antics that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Surprisingly, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So, in any case, the fantastic F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
This one: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, providing low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you're ready to go.
The water pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the water pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, so that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the package services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really tough time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just flew along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He said he would love to go back to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Do you just need the tracking number from my email?
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I of course had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study until my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear about great career opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of college in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Weekend Breaks
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax and unwind.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems like it's also available before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... why because?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been too long and that can't be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed hostage situation due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
She still has a lot to do before the festive days: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I really have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the feather loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Modelleisenbahner ME Magazine 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 about the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment potential of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 which were available in larger quantities were preferred for assembly.
Only when it became apparent that the reprocessing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, did the E 95 come into focus for reprocessing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As age increased, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the fireman who was constantly on board this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors was frequent and led to months of outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed internally in 1986.
The locomotive is being preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditions Association have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, with the transformers checked and five drive motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their efficient drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive needs to be done by the buyer, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will you be sent off?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hi #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the statement, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend motivated him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information circulating on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia went dark: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several communities were left without power due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is back on.
The fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back up.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
As of 11:15 PM, those still affected by the power outage would have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return it, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inner side of the components which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back and forth swiping with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark colors could show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks if it mixes with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models: Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is taking your time, being patient, and having a steady hand when applying stickers.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal onto the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Warning: Always check that the picture is properly aligned before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or tear.
Wipe away excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me.
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing to pay.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet claim them with the private health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the room here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
OK.
We will not be ordering anything from you anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
Feel free to forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you're telling me I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see the screenshot for what the colleague wrote.
It is clearly stated that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly constitutes a low-budget film.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Looking to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus comes with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) declared.
This limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another Attempt at Crossing the Border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is apparently not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made regarding a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is alleged to have illegally overtaken.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking on that.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan event.
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in existence since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing the beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, fix it and not all from our household.

I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a €60 voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package needs to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
God has set all this in motion, as far as I'm concerned.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-error free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
These specifications only apply to exact conditions that rarely match the conditions of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, please refer to the "Technical Data" table (See user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz municipality are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some strange situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on something.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them for that purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer?!
I have received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan which received and sent 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module that broadcasts the wifi does not receive the full 500 anymore, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less it receives (so using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch checking accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the savings account.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements made with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to the female and male fans equally.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And crossed the baby wish off the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Here's hoping that success and fame bring happiness.
Undignified End of a Career: Räikkönen Has to Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo before the halfway point of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously placing second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte wins at home - Podium for Jamanka
At the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She notched her first podium finish of the winter in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get a podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me along.
I'm really happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked about it.
Last year due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said it had expired which made me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting only on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe some other people feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also suffering from a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having a tummy ache right now, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do homework, which we obviously have to divide up.
But even cooking is just too much work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm doing okay.
Not great, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently asking a lot of me; I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and I should at least prepare a bit for the anatomy class the day after tomorrow.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on and on.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams without it.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I'd find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening anyway, the week is almost done!
I received my order today but unfortunately the color is different and the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
By the way, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious studies teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always seemed strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed it.
What do you think about it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, then I would advise against it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help with Movie Search Please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If this rings a bell to you, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take a lot more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the stomach?
Or does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already a "regular customer" with you and have bought many items already.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
This is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A generic advertising channel trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My little heat friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Afterwards, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated use.
Make sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion is placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be machine washed at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt Second in Hinserie - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Ingolstadt is not doing well even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up again despite the power adapter being plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, remain well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
The closure flap has a metal clasp with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you don't have to rummage through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior space (more on that below) and easily store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of
Contact from the shipping company announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any message yet.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will get an email as confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
Wishing you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneering colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the auctioneer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped in foil) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else usually shipped with DPD insured and with tracking (Games wrapped in foil, wrapped in tissue paper and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are no pressure marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible, as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries Discussing Removal of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated People
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you are describing is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however u/Nitemarex had none by definition.**
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce in addition to legal obligations.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
One more question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I need to cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had posed a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97 years old
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The heartbreaking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify here my life's gratitude".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York Wins First MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got lots of great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I'm getting the taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I can manage this.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check that.
Where to find Christmas Roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier plays a major role in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even provide a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when making direct recordings.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally get yourself a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live performance.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to return them.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations for the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence in Germany
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day rate at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive medical treatment in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself.
I think an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It's time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the German Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I used to think that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was becoming disgruntled, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan you get quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot change this as I cannot be present due to a funeral.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
Starting from February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnstein Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle for water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein at the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a continuous increase in activity: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed, and re-downloaded the app and NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because this whole process has taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thanks for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into any more detail than that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, however, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people on the right are naturally attracted to uniforms and weapons, and that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality. Of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them and tries to do right by them, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there. However, it is completely exaggerated by the media that these people are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain like-minded people meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that's a good thing in my opinion that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
We are still discussing my order which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Neater through child?
Hi, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and then and then I get motivated and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case "that someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because I don't have much motivation for it, it doesn't bother me too much as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, extended embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows, and knees).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal around the face at the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for increased durability
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the dive computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in Social Work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The code review process is already causing problems for me (emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, the message appears "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book".
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein taken in with the feed in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and then builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the renewal of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this course of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the start of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Also submitted a petition to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
The by-laws explicitly list the walnut tree as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, I still have a sofa without any use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb

Oh, okay, I understand.
Great, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately just okay, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and I was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'm googling other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and finish at least the sketch, after that I can always switch direction.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the PhD I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even a family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally it's fun and from the outside it looks like the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can tell that everything is kind of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely up to date with the latest sound technology.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp, of course.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp is primarily responsible for the tube-like character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers shine, but it is not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas of a combined size of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, more areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus Became the Christmas Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been getting this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting, as I
Otherwise buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Glowstone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you decide the color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.

No hardware store was open anyway during the lockdown....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved significantly.
A variable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation especially for bell-type armature motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies!
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
As for my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne all over my body when I took my last two-year break from 0 to 100.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to wait for the dermatologist appointment.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of peace, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to a chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy, and low meat diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It could also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have problems everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else could be wrong.
I had already sent everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
but is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in black in large quantities

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom, they are sitting in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them talk to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't log into my customer account.
Could you please resend me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Sure, I already ordered the same chair in blue in November and got it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely disassembled for pick-up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The plan approval decision of the Lower Bavarian government clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for tutorials, etc.).
When I'm planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am mostly dissatisfied with the most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only open to those who are vaccinated or recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there have been revenue losses at stores with non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the CEO.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation must be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet they received.
Furthermore, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the Centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances, is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Operating with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The assembly of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking levers on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it up, scored within an hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and won spectacularly 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead 2:0.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I just got the email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Team Before Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged German national team coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team was scored after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game a bit better and at least came within five goals of the opposition by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster up an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely finished, it will then continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a specific person (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does this go with the vaccination..").
My responsibilities include educating people about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor present, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also not for those "who want everything to go quickly".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that "the Huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, an educational gap was closed - even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for road racing - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire was not willing to continue the rest of the journey at all.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
The weather wasn't too bad, so maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really rather not have this problem again.
It wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of driving, then I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€/tire just to be disappointed in the end.
I'm also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that have this feature (apparently?), but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD based on my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a matching designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight high-frequency boost.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an unparalleled dynamic range.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front, and bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
The following steps are marking and pre-drilling (2.5-mm drill bit) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is easiest achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leave it sticking out about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
By using the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
