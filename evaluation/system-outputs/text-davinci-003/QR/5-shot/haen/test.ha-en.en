Reason for my departure from the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has stated some reasons for his departure from the PDP to the APC.
If we remember correctly, Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara defected from the PDP party and joined the APC this week.
Dependent said that he stayed to enjoy the patronage of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi state which helped the masses to win the 2019 election, only for him to gather and leave the party to return to where he belongs in the APC.
The main reason I left Bauchi state is because of how the PDP is ruling it.
Everyone is aware of the role I played in the gubernatorial election which saw the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed oust the incumbent Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now there is corruption and mismanagement in the Bala government.
Instead of staying in the PDP, they gave me what I deserved and asked me to leave and go back to where I came from.
Dependence wrote a resignation letter from the PDP which he sent to the male leader of the party, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally he said that, as he had been reminding other governors where they had failed and where they should make amends, he himself was not exempt.
Let me go on my journey and leave them alone.
A fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire started around 10 pm and lasted for almost two hours, despite the efforts of the Kano State Fire Service, security personnel and members of the community to put it out.
When Freedom Radio visited the site, they found people in distress and various security personnel there and there, as the site was connected to the major highway known as Kuka Highway, which transports passengers from here in Kano to other states and neighboring countries of the country.
In addition to the Kofar Ruwa market in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio interviewed some eyewitnesses who said the fire caused distress and suffering among the people.
A motorway service station at Kofar Ruwa said they had collaborated with the police to evacuate passengers who had become distressed due to the flooding.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, stating that up to the time of filing this report, it was still collecting data to ascertain the cause and the extent of damage caused by the fire, as stated by the agency's spokesperson Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, reports indicate that some robbers attempted to break into the Kofar Ruwa market to steal, but police officers and security personnel tried to repel them and protect the public's property.
We then contacted the Kano State Police Command Spokesperson, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
CORONAVIRUS CURE: We have not yet completed the testing of the cure developed in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to conduct tests for the accuracy of the Coronavirus vaccine, Nigeria is not left behind in joining and conducting its own tests.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 coronavirus drugs submitted to it by traditional medicine practitioners.
Commissioner Mojisola Adeyeye announced that on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that tests are being done on the efficacy of the medicines to avoid any fraudulent acquisition.
Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, herbalists have intensified their research to ensure that they are not left behind in finding a cure for the disease.
Many of them have submitted their drug for testing and verification of its authenticity to the government.
Furthermore, NAFDAC imposed certain requirements and regulations that they must follow in manufacturing the drug.
The drugs will be tested for efficacy on animals first hand.
Mojisola cautioned practitioners not to recklessly administer any medication without authorization from the authorities.
In May, NAFDAC announced that news of those claiming to have discovered a traditional cure for the Coronavirus should only be seen on social media and newspaper websites.
Adeyeye stated that it was only one person who challenged the NAFDAC to investigate the authenticity of the remedy he claimed was of traditional origin and that it could cure Coronavirus.
He too was that same person, not a cure he said he had discovered.
He concluded that the symptoms of ill health seen were symptoms of disease contraction.
However, since then some practitioners have been challenging the authority with their alliance.

Nigeria Will Open Its International Airports On Saturday.
Nigerian authorities have announced they will open airports for outbound and inbound flights to the country, from Saturday onwards, for the first time in five months of closure.
On March 23rd, the government of the country suspended the entry and exit of aircrafts due to the containment of the spread of the coronavirus.
The government has stated that the first four planes to arrive from foreign countries will begin landing in the capital city of Abuja.
It's Lagos, but so far it hasn't been revealed from where these trains will come.
According to the Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika, the decision to open this was, seeing as there have been no issues since the resumption of domestic flights on the 8th of July.
He added that measures would be taken to ensure that the return of the flights was successful in accordance with all the necessary regulations.

Nigeria's Disease Control Center, NCDC, provided the number of people and states on its Twitter page.

APC Accuses Governor Neja Of Attempting To Introduce Factionism In The Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released last week, the APC party accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring division within the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineering Association Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Association Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that in the six years the association has been in power in the state, only Naira 512 million has been received.
The document further stated that the meeting convened by the governor, which was chaired last Monday, would help to bring about reconciliation in the party, where they said they had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the youth of the party by organizing a chaotic meeting, which is not in accordance with the rules, for any complaints against the party leaders, they should be written to the party secretary for investigation".
He continued to say that to date , in the six years since the party was founded , N512 million is in the party's account.
He said what he understood as governor was to be part of the national reconciliation committee set up on July 25, 2020, which the president had appointed to lead the arrangement of issues between the youth of the party and to resolve the court cases between the youth of the party.
He said that the money we received was used to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries, and for other activities related to the party, such as organizing rallies and resolving some of the party's problems such as health care due to lack of access to government aid, not any party funds were spent without authorization, we challenge anyone to bring us evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I mentioned, the recent elections of the local governments in the state, is the most important election that has been held in the country which we conducted with the former governors and the current incumbents in all the twenty-five local governments in the state, and the funds spent on the elections were allocated to the governors to bring about their constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent without any rules, this is almost an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name to it, saying that there is no committee that has been set up to investigate how party funds are being spent and who set it up.
Among the funds the complainant alleges were misappropriated, are funds provided by the national party treasurer, not any other funds, so I challenge any evidence he may have to support this allegation in any way.
The Imam said we should stand firmly in defense of the APC party from any attempt by any individual or group to undermine this party, he further added that any allegation against the party or any leader of the party from the state level shall be referred to the disciplinary committee as provided in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) of page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the opposition's water carriers have no role to play particularly if they attempt to wrest control of the committee, so their verdict has no effect.
For this reason, they are the legitimate leaders of the party approved by the state, in accordance with article 21 and paragraph six of section 87 of the party's constitution, any violation of this will not be taken into account.
Because the ruling of severing ties was a mistake made by the rulers.
He said those who presented themselves with consent yesterday at the meeting which did not improve, Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The approval committee for water and sanitation projects is to be chaired by the party's engineering leader Mohammed Imam only, not the governor will chair the state party leaders.
The document further stated that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello had reminded of the commitment made to the people of the state during the election, to travel with the party parents in government so that everyone in the state and all the zones would benefit through political appointments, which is the challenge of the Governor and the party.
The resolution commended the federal legislators who did not attend the meeting and drew attention to the need for reconciliation of all issues between the party members, which was not surprising to the legislators who were aware of their grievances and refused to accept fraud as a party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the national committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate stance and not attempt to undermine the politics of the state.
Nigeria is well-positioned in terms of Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, said the country is ready to take the lead in the digital economy sector.
He also said that the government is prepared to work step by step with scientists , academics , and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is kept abreast of all modern technological developments.
Dr. Isa Ali Fantami articulated that during an international conference on the advancement of communication technology held via the internet.
Furthermore, the minister added that one of the first steps the government took to ensure that the country was benefiting from communication technology was to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Economic Development through the Internet.
How food spoilage affects the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating food that has been treated with food preservatives that such food can be detrimental to human health.
The experts issued this warning after conducting a study on the quality of food consumed in this country.
The results of the study showed that there are some foods that are fortified with nutrients to prevent them from spoiling.
The research also showed that this material was most commonly used in fisheries, poultry farms and fish farms that are sold to the public.
The material is used so that when someone sees it they will be interested in buying it and using it.
Furthermore, food containing this substance can cause diabetes, stroke, heart disease and other ailments.
The people of this country have been called upon to pay attention to abstaining from the use of such foods for their health.
If we remember, food technologist Grace Olasumbo called on Nigerians to avoid consuming fruits ripened with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used reagent by consumers to ripen fruits, namely stone fruits.
Research has shown that patience and perseverance are among the factors that make market participants use this resource to demonstrate their products in a single day.
Olasumbo stated that what the market was missing was the use of this material to demonstrate that the stone products were not harmful to human health.
Therefore, we can be afflicted with diseases such as fever and chills, eye infection, abdominal pain, sore throat, cough, flu and others.
The African nations' central bank governor has been cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The eminent panel chaired by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has exonerated African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the charges of corruption leveled against him.
The news agency AFP reported that, early this year, a report of fifteen pages accused Mr. Adesina of sixty of favoritism, mismanagement and self-enrichment.
However, the panel of experts chaired by Robinson, along with Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and the World Bank's Vice President for Compliance Leonard McCarthy, exonerated the former Nigerian Agriculture Minister of all charges against him.
Previously, the United States had insisted on an investigation into Mr. Adesina's allegations, following a whistle-blower complaint by the African Development Bank's governing board, prompting the formation of a panel of experts to conduct the investigation into the allegations.
COVID-19 Halts Trump Campaign Rally in Florida.
Yesterday, Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he was cancelling the major Republican convention that was scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, in the coming weeks, due to the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
Nevertheless, the major conference will be held in the state of North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it would not be appropriate to hold a large gathering at this time.
President Trump moved a portion of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they clashed with Democratic party leaders in North Carolina over holding the convention in an open-air venue without requiring face masks for attendees.
A few representatives of the Republican party will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially nominate Trump on August 24th.
Trump said he would make an acceptance speech in a different format.
Trump, who has spent months downplaying the impact of the pandemic, even recently saying that 99 percent of the cases seen in the US have been “totally harmless,” will not be without fault.

The Sheikh said this measure was taken as a result of advice received from the Islamic Council to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus.
President Muhammadu Buhari has also reiterated the measures that the assembly has recommended to be taken to avoid gatherings where many people would be in one place.
At this year's local Eid celebration, the president performed his prayer at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he usually does every year.

Achieve Success for Our Worthy Citizens - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the essence of life for all creatures , one cannot live without food.
This is why the Chinese government is increasingly striving to ensure the country's population is well-fed.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in the field of food security, a feat that has amazed the world given the country's population, estimated to be 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has greatly helped the cause of global hunger eradication, as the head of China's State Food and Grain Administration Zhang Wufeng has previously stated that since 1949, China has always placed the issue of hunger alleviation at the forefront of all its national activities.
But in recent days, some people and some media outlets in the Western world have again "expressed concern" about whether China can shoulder the responsibility of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide?
We sincerely thank them for always looking out for the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved the goal of providing adequate food through its efforts.
Providing food security for the Chinese is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS, President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important directive to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that any food waste is a result of hard work.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating to the world and has caused disruption to China's economy, China will still be able to provide sufficient food for its people.
Statistics released by China's National Bureau of Statistics regarding the amount of grain, particularly rice, that the country will harvest in 2020 indicate that the amount of rice harvested in the country in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, the former president of China's Academy of Agricultural Sciences, also said that China has achieved great successes in terms of national wealth and food security when compared to the early period of domestic reform and opening up to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, director of the Institute of Agricultural Policies at Peking University, told a reporter from "The China Science Daily" that the major challenge China is facing now is whether in the next two or three years, China can reduce the amount of grain and cotton stored in warehouses.
Now the amount of meat each person receives has reached 474 kilograms per year instead of the 400 kilograms each person in the world should receive annually.
And now China is importing millions of tons of grain for domestic livestock feed only.
Therefore, those who show concern should divert their attention, take a nap, or focus on the affairs of their country at home.
The Chinese are able to sustain themselves with the food they produce themselves.
Why I'm prosecuting Ganduje - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
PDP gubernatorial candidate for Kano Abba Kabir Yusuf has stated his reasons for indicting Kano Governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some businessmen before the High Court.
Abba Kabir was represented by his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who stated that he filed the suit based on the allegation of illegally occupying some government-owned properties that are beneficial to the people of Kano State.
In addition to the Kano State Government and the market traders, Abba Kabir Yusuf also sued the state ministry of works, housing and transport, the state attorney general and commissioner of justice, and the state ministry of lands and survey.
Abba Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State Government of seizing some ancestral lands of the former Daula dynasty which are now under the care of the University of Science and Technology in Wudil and the Shahuci airstrip, which he said contravenes the laws of the country.
Aim high, in the context of a phased approach by 2023.
President Muhammadu Buhari's son-in-law and Senior Special Assistant, Mamman Daura has stated that the power rotation being practiced in Nigeria has become a thing of the past.
Mamman Daura said that Nigeria has already done enough groundwork and now should focus on selecting the most suitable candidate for 2023.
BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he expressed this.
This rotational system of electing a president in Nigeria has not yielded a visible result since it was initiated in 1999.
Instead, Daura said to focus on selecting the right person rather than following this pick-and-choose approach.
However, the Igbo people, the Inyamirai, have taken issue with Daura's interpretation of this phrase.
They said it was only when he and his brother President Buhari had shared power through rotation that he would come out now and advise against it in 2023.
Buhari himself was not chosen above all Nigerians.
So the senior security officers of this country who have been sitting in their chairs for years have not been removed , and they are no more capable of working than the others.
Inyamirai's rebuttal.
A gust of political wind blew across Nigeria on Wednesday as the Igbo Emancipation Movement, Ndigbo, rejected the nomination of Mamman Daura for the position of Nigerian President, citing his anti-Igbo utterances.
In an interview with Daura, who is President Muhammad Buhari's nephew, he said that a zoning system will be used in the 2023 presidential election.
Thus, in his words not yet done with social media, Ndigbo promptly released a statement to condemn Mamman Daura's tirade, calling on him to desist from inciting tribalism.
In a statement issued on Wednesday by the Igbo ethnic group in the South-East and South-South regions of Nigeria, they declared that they will produce the president in the 2023 election, that is, the Igbo ethnic group.
The Spokesperson of the Igbo Ethnic Group Zalla, Emeka Attamah said that Mamman Daura's statements are like a declaration of his intention to run for the Nigerian presidency in 2023 are an insult to the Igbo people.
Besides illness, what has prevented Mamman Daura from speaking out since 2019?
They have ousted Jonathan, and now Daura is making a southern power bloc that will dominate Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
After he finishes painting what he has taken from his uncle who is the current president of the country, he will then come out with a surprise issue that we do not know about in 2023.
He should take it upon himself to embrace truth and hold it firmly.
He not only expressed his support for the ruling party in 2023, but also showed his love and affection.
VOA Discussion Forum on Rape.
The issue of gender-based violence against women and children through rape has become a hot topic in Northern Nigeria where reports have emerged showing how children's rights are being violated.
People from various backgrounds attended the hall on July 23rd to discuss how the situation was worsening in the country and how it should be brought to an end.
The forum participants linked the problem to issues such as the pressure put on young girls and the overbearingness of some parents.
One of the mothers who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the widow of the late former governor of Plateau and Niger State during the Sani Abacha regime, described poverty as one of the reasons why parents impose restrictions on their children.
Mrs. Maryam Mamman Nasir, the leader of an organization that campaigns against this menace, said "First of all, we must educate mothers on the dangers of letting their children wander, because only when a child is gone will they realize the harm done".
We will also call on teachers to begin preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who commit rape against their children and wards.
The Honorable Shehu Mohammad, the House of Representatives member representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse constituencies in Kebbi State, expressed his dismay at the situation and his support for the enactment of a stringent law to punish anyone found guilty of rape in the country.
At the end of the session , Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasiru El-Hikaya , who led the meeting , expressed their gratitude to those who attended the meeting in response to the invitation of the VOA.
Northern Media Writers' Contribution to Northern Unity.
Modern communication media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat and others have long been playing a major role in creating platforms for dialogue, collaboration and unity among different world communities, as well as sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational and commercial objectives.
Young people in Nigeria have embraced this new technology of social media to travel virtually, to give their contributions or voice their opinions on issues that affect their lives.
We can say that these developments have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economic, educational and political affairs.
Many are eating food by writing articles and sending messages online, getting jobs done or developing projects they are working on.
It is regrettable to see how some youths instead of using this opportunity for the advancement that has been achieved, some have resorted to following the footsteps of the downtrodden children of the southern part of the country who have fled the country in search of greener pastures, both within and outside the country, or engaging in writing of hate speeches and insulting of authorities and elders.
What is indicative of a lack of progress is present in the lives of the youth of this country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers in the country is a great blessing, providing Northern youth with a good platform and a clean environment to express themselves on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and promote the goals of the Northern people.
It is incumbent upon us to give this organization the collaboration it needs to achieve its noble objectives , which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region but to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youths , especially those using social media , to come together to protect the North's identity and rights , and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.
As our Northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their contemporaries have desired to provide for the people of the North.
It is reported that the late champion of justice and equity Malam Aminu Kano once said, Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his own house!
So we say , certainly as we call for the advancement of the nation and the improvement of the political system , at every level , we reiterate our call for the unity of the North , without prejudice to religion or ethnicity , to bring progress to our region .
If we consider how the North used to be and not how it is now.
So we should use the wisdom that God has given us to contribute and provide advice in order to create a sustainable path for economic development in the North.
The North should provide sources of revenue to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide funds.
Furthermore , if we are to progress in the North , we must give importance to education , agriculture , tourism , health and science and technology.
Money is not the only way we can provide assistance , there are other ways to do so.
We believe that is how the North will fulfill our visionaries' dreams!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated 126 billion naira for the renovation of hospitals in the country.
The federal government has allocated N126 billion from its economic revitalization plans to renovate hospitals in the country.
Hospitals to be renovated include FMC Hospital, testing centers, intensive care units, isolation wards for contagious diseases, and teaching hospitals in 36 states across the country.
In recent years, some stakeholders in the health sector have called on government agencies to join hands in allocating funds to improve the health sector of the country.
The experts made this call at a symposium on providing accessible and quality healthcare to people held in Abuja.
In his campaign speech for the senatorial seat representing Kwara North under the APC party, Sadiq Umar said it was important for the Nigerian government to take seriously the issues of improving the health of the nation.
He said that not doing so has caused the sector to suffer from financial problems which has caused it to rely heavily on the aid it receives from foreign countries.
Umar said that despite all the aid they were receiving, there was no visible effort from the government in the health sector, which led them to start withdrawing the aid they were giving.

The number of people who will die from hunger in Africa will surpass those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has reported that an additional 23 million people are at risk of starvation in the Sahel region of Africa in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made this statement at the Plenary Session on the Economy, of the World Economic Forum.
The meeting discussed the issue of Food Security in Africa, in the time of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Houngbo said that research and estimates of how to tackle the food crisis showed that in 2020, the number of people dying from hunger in Africa would exceed those killed by the Coronavirus, by a wide margin.
IFAD is a renowned center for supporting people living in rural areas to develop agriculture, provide them with nutritious food and generate income through farming.
Houngbo said that Coronavirus has shown there is a grave problem with the food production, distribution and transformation system.
Many farmers are frustrated by their inability to obtain modern equipment due to travel restrictions.
Furthermore, they cannot go to the farm and those who farm for sale, markets have been closed except for them to sell their farm produce.
The report further noted that in 2019, 135 million people were affected by hunger worldwide, with 73 million of them coming from 36 countries in Africa.
In Nigeria, hunger has decimated 5 million people in 2019.

The Nigerian oil company further added that this is an additional tax revenue that has been generated since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, which has caused the imposition of travel restrictions and the drop in oil prices in the global market.

It's not only Buhari who has the right to protect this country - Nanono - Freedom Radio Nigeria.

Well, the federal government has the right to regulate the lives of the people, but those who are close to these people should have started the conversation that we see a problem with these issues in the first place.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono further added that the federal government is making concerted efforts to boost agriculture and food security in the country.
President Trump Signs Drug Price Reduction Act.

One of the regulations will allow for the importation of prescription drugs from countries such as Canada legally, while another regulation will require drug manufacturers to reduce their prices, according to Trump.
Another rule would require a reduction in the price of insulin while a fourth rule, which could not be implemented if the negotiations with drug companies are successful, would require the Medicare insurance system to purchase drugs at the same prices other countries pay, according to Trump.

Kano Elders Take Ganduje's Case To Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A coalition of human rights groups in Kano has filed a lawsuit against the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, to President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow from a Chinese state bank to build a railway line.
A coalition of more than 15 organizations under the umbrella of the Kano Forum has expressed what it calls a collective outrage at the government of Ganduje's intention to acquire land for the construction of the first railway line in Kano as something that is of no benefit in light of the major challenges facing the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje would withdraw the sum of 684 million euros, equivalent to about three billion naira, which they said the government would not be able to pay back in 50 years.
The President of the organization, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, said it is almost impossible to say that Kano State has taken on a burden greater than that which it has already borne in the past.
Rape Verdicts in Nigeria are Only a Band-Aid Solution -Maigidaje.
An elder in the community in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, has indicated that the imposition of the death penalty on those convicted of rape in the country, particularly in Northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made this announcement during his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, where he further added that, if the government confirms this after investigation, the only solution is to impose the death penalty.
He added that a ruling would reduce the amount of sexual assault that can be obtained, but the biggest relief is for us to change our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, he said in our situation as Muslims we should be devoted to Allah, devoted to the Prophet, stand firm in our hearts, because no one knows when they will die.
He said it was shameful for a full grown man or elder to take a young girl or a three year old or five year old and rape her.
He went on to say that, between God and us, we should not criticize rulers or kings, implying that no progress can be made if such disrespect is present.
He added that this is why we are in a state of stagnation and difficulty in the country, because the country has not progressed, the rulers, governors and president have not known how to handle the situation.
He added that they had to demolish that building and then another one emerged , so it was necessary for us to change our attitudes so that God could bring us a solution to the rape problem.
He declared that, even if it was for safety, everything should be relinquished to God for He is the one who protects all from distress and poverty for the people.
He said, no matter what situation a person finds themselves in, Allah is aware of them and nothing you do will be hidden, so always think you will die and always think you are behind, if you are behind in what you have been given then make up for it.
He indicated that the police by law are doing their best to send those accused of rape to the Court of Law but their efforts in this regard has become a menace in our region of Northern Nigeria and the country at large.
He called on parents in particular to keep a close eye on their children, citing examples of the burdens that young girls are placed with that can lead to problems.
He said that some parents do not monitor the lives of their children, whether they go to school or not, or come home on time or not, adding that part of the blame lies with some parents because they should know that Allah has given them children and on the Day of Judgment He will ask them what kind of upbringing they gave their children.

Rice Farmers Expecting Good Yields In This Year's Harvest - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Benue State are expecting a bumper harvest two months after planting.
Some of those discussed in Makurdi expressed the hope that the harvest would be at any time between October and November.
A small-scale farmer in the Mbatiab-Gboko town of Benue State, Titus Atondo, said he planted his maize crop in an area of two hectares in July.
Atondo said he sourced varieties from his region and they are in two groups of CP and OC rice while using Dazzle as the seed material to share seedlings for planting and harvesting.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in upland areas are many because we rely heavily on manual labor as customers cannot access mechanized means.
Titus Atondo added that they take people to do farming from the grassroots level up to harvest , where he added that this is tiring and a lot.
Atondo said that all the money spent on his farm which is now in operation includes seed, fertilizer, modern equipment and is expected to reach N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags as a bulk purchase from the two vendors that would likely be sold at a price of Naira 29,000 per 100k bag.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted seedlings in June to July on an area of 274 hectares with a price of Naira 14,500 per hectare while the field cost Naira 25,000 per hectare.
He sourced variety 44 (Supi) and variety 61 (OC) seeds from the National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) and some were sourced from Olam Nigeria.
He added that growth in this period is in different stages while some are in the harvesting stage, some are in the initial stage of animal slaughter as practiced in farming stages.
Tarnongu further added that the challenges so far have been financial since the cost of procuring the selected animals is expensive and the cost of fodder has increased.
He said that the harvest is expected to begin in October to November.
He added that the total cost of the inputs at the end of the day would be the least Naira 246,000 per hectare while an expected yield of three tonnes was anticipated which would translate to Naira 360,000 on a Naira 120 per kilo basis.
Tarnongu does not use chemicals on the rice field, instead, it provides advice and implements traditional farming, where he adds that, therefore, we use very few pesticides, herbicides and insecticides.
The President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed his hope that the weather this year will be conducive for the cultivation of a lot of rice.
According to the President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have entered the maize farming business at the end of this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many people from leaving their offices and staying at home.
He said, By me, me, it will capture 20 percent of what is produced in 2019, which is estimated to be more than one billion.
He said that currently data collectors are taking surveys of different types of farmers and once the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, comrade Aondongu Saaku, who said he farms three hectares of rice, noticed that some farmers harvested their rice in June while those who farm for short periods do so at the expected time at the end of November or early December.
The AFAN president further stated that farmers are using pesticides to kill pests, weeds, and herbicides.
He expressed his concern about the challenges of animals that threaten rice farming, adding that farmers are doing their best, placing fences around the fields to address the issue.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have refuted Abike Dabire's claim that students are being subjected to genocide in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, the TRCN, have rebuked the Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), for warning their parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, saying they are being subjected to slave-like conditions.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa issued this warning that thousands of Nigerians are being killed in Northern Cyprus without the government of the country conducting thorough investigations.
The minister made this statement after news of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel was received.
The student, who was Nigerian, was killed and no further information has been heard since.
The murder of Ibrahim Khaleel should serve as a lesson to parents to stop sending their children to the world, to be slaughtered in vain, especially in the Northern Cyprus country.
The problem is that people are not aware that the world does not recognize Northern Cyprus as a country.
The United Nations has not endorsed the country either.
But many Nigerians are living in their country to study, yet thousands of Nigerians are being killed in the country.
The Minister said that Nigeria will reveal the names of thousands of Nigerians who have been victims of murder in the country.
However, as they voiced their dissent, Nigerian students studying in the Northern Cyprus country said that peace in Northern Cyprus is far better than that of Nigeria, far and away.
The President of the National Association of Nigerian Students Abroad (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, stated that although Nigerian students in foreign countries are facing challenges, students in Northern Cyprus are not facing any problems, challenges or discrimination.
This was the evidence presented to PREMIUM TIMES in the course of the interview.
He said it was not true that thousands of Nigerian students had died in Cyprus.
He said the report of the student's death was false.
Few of those who died were all accident victims, not homicides.

According to ECOWAS, no agreement has been reached yet despite their disapproval of the coup that ousted IBK from power.
Now eyes are on to see how it will pan out.
Religious leaders exhort their followers to truthfulness so that they will not be troubled.
The Kaduna State Commissioner for Justice, Yusuf Zailani, has urged religious leaders to always tell their followers the truth instead of misleading them in places of worship and creating disharmony.
Zailani expressed this when he was speaking at the Kaduna State Government House conference room when the state government was receiving the delegation of the Nigerian Christian Association who visited Kaduna yesterday.
Zailani added that "It is true that they do not like to be criticized, if you go to some places of worship you will hear their leaders preaching and then they vilify the morality of their non-believers."
That is what stirs up strife among people.
Finally he said that unity must be restored and religious leaders must teach the followers of God's message as it is written in our religious books, or else there will be no peace.
Likewise, the Senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani who attended this meeting requested that those who are not residents of Kaduna should be mindful of their words before speaking.
This conflict has been going on for more than 40 years.

The People Praise The King, I Receive Praise From Them.
The film filled with songs by Beyonce titled "Black is King", or The Black Man is King, continues to receive accolades and acclaim around the world, for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where this 85-minute film was shot, many people have said it surpasses a film.
Black is King is a music-filled film led by renowned singer and songwriter Beyonce, featuring choreography, direction, and completion.
This film featured a soundtrack titled "The Lion King: The Gift", or Sarakin Zaki: Ɗan Baiwa.
The movie was filmed in America, Central and West Africa, and Europe, and it featured many African musicians.
This film, released in July, received positive reviews from viewers, but there were also some detractors.
Some say that Beyonce, born in Houston, Texas in the US, appropriated African elements without context, particularly in her music video, despite having no ancestral ties to the African continent.
But in South Africa, there is much celebration for those who took part in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film studies student, said he was honored to be included in the filmmaking team.
He said the movie moved him.
The film touches on many topics that are not taught in school about the history of the African continent.
He said that when he saw the movie, he began to see the story and the costumes she was wearing and the whole movie, which brought out many more things than what was expected to happen.
King Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's music, said that Africans in the diaspora - including African-American youth - have the opportunity to use what some consider to be African cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the movie.
The King said that women were often relegated to a lower status in society.
So their involvement in matters of great consequence is a source of encouragement.
The student reading about filmmaking, Mathebula, said that the Beyonce film inspired him to start making his own film to spread messages about Africa.
African fans of Beyonce have agreed on one thing: If the King is a Man, then Beyonce is the Queen.

At the same time that farmers are struggling to reap their harvests in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto State have begun to complain about the menace of pests that have begun to cause them harm, which could potentially bring about the expected benefits of farming.
The threat of locusts in Sokoto State is seen as a blessing in disguise, as signs of a good harvest have been seen in this 2020 year.
Necessarily, some local farmers adopted a traditional method of controlling pests as a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni region explained.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said that the locusts are now destroying all the crops that have started to sprout in the fields.
The Chairman of the Nigerian Farmers Association in Sokoto State, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that currently two-thirds of Sokoto State are facing this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of the small local governments in the state to compile a report to be sent to the state and federal agriculture departments to take action to help the farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture's Director of Pest Control and Quarantine, Ya'u Maƙeri Kagara, stated that it would not take more than one week to complete the extermination of pests in the Sokoto area.
He added that the refugees were coming from Nigeria and Benin, and that international cooperation was necessary to resolve the issue, requiring an agreement between the countries.
In June, the federal government launched a de-worming project in 12 northern Nigerian states bordering foreign countries from which worms were entering Nigeria.
However, re-emerging of this problem can set back the progress that is being seen in the agricultural sector which governments are claiming to give special attention to.

A New COVID-19 Relief Bill Will Be Reintroduced in the US.
As data shows that the number of those infected with COVID-19 continues to rise in America, today Monday it is expected that members of the Republican Party in the US Congress will present a relief bill.
It is thought that the bailout will bring in one trillion dollars to alleviate the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan is to arrive days ahead of the expiration of the initial stimulus money for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yesterday, Sunday, after days of negotiations with Republican lawmakers in Congress, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the relief package would include an expansion of the program to provide money to those who have lost their jobs.
But according to them , this time , Americans will see only 70 out of 100 of the money they were given before.
On Friday the first installment of the relief will end, which paid out some monetary aid to those who lost their jobs, and also provided an additional $600 per week on top of what states were giving.
The Republicans are complaining that this scheme means some people are getting paid twice, receiving both federal and state government assistance when they are working.
But Democrats on their side have challenged this statement , citing the increasing spread of the coronavirus and some employees not having the peace of mind to return to work.
Reason for my return to APC after leaving PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has stated the reasons for his switch from the PDP to the APC after the President's re-election announcement of the party's nomination of Mai Mala Buni.
In a letter written to the PDP in his constituency of Bogoro, Dogara stated that the resignation of his governorship in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed administration that helped him to victory was the reason for his departure from the party.
Dependence said he could not open his mouth to question how the government of the state was being run without being accused of disloyalty, so he took the decision to leave the party.
The former Speaker said that if he were to raise his hands in support of the way things are going in Bauchi State under Governor Bala Muhammed, it would be a betrayal, after during the time of Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar everyone heard his voice expressing his opinion if he saw something wrong.

People need to be aware of the 2019 - KCSF Legal Code.
The coalition of civil society organizations operating independently in Kano State, namely the Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in collaboration with the European Union Delegation, the British Council, and the Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (Rolac), presented a paper on the implementation of the 2019 Criminal Procedure Code.

Those who are often unaware of their rights , as the law has more than 400 articles , with more detailed provisions.
Discussion on the New Regulation of Places of Worship in Nigeria is Ongoing.
The human rights and economic development advocacy group SERAP has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately suspend the Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Registrar-General of the Corporate Affairs Commission over the planned registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this measure is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights organizations protested this government action, religious leaders from different faiths had already presented their grievances to the Buhari government, that the House of Representatives should reconsider and approve the bill, so that it would not conflict with the religious freedom and tolerance provided by the constitution.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna State, told a Voice of America reporter that this law does not have a basis, but if the government is seeking to prohibit worship or impose restrictions.
It should only be done by using existing means to monitor and investigate all lawbreakers without introducing any new law.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the Imam of the Science University in Minna said that although it is not wrong for the government to keep an eye on companies and organizations for national security, that does not mean that it should be done at the expense of infringing on the rights of any individual or group.
Now all that remains to be seen is whether the government will heed this public outcry.
How the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) attempted to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has taken up the responsibility of blocking access to the PREMIUM TIMES website, a renowned online newspaper in Nigeria.
This attempt to hack into websites, i.e. the internet, did all the tactics that hackers usually follow to gain access to the sites, but it was unsuccessful.
He began to tamper with the system, or "hacking" on February 28th, where he broke into the university's computer equipment and continued to carry out his attacks by using the university's "data".
On the other hand , if he attempted to hack the PREMIUM TIMES internet server , he then launched another attack on his GSM phone.
Five days of hacking attempts were made to breach the entrance of the PREMIUM TIMES main server, but they were unsuccessful despite using various modern technology tools.
He was unsuccessful in breaking in, because the university was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had a robust security system in place, which had built-in safeguards and a reinforced door that a novice burglar could not breach.
Furthermore, PREMIUM has a formidable team of modern day cyber security experts comprising the PREMIUM TIMES Cyber Army and the Grand Marshal, PREMIUM TIMES Website Warden.
These security personnel with modern expertise in thwarting any terrorist or criminal attempt to perpetrate mayhem alone or in a gang, or to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES Database.
Types of Ads Internet Banners Carried by PREMIUM TIMES Website:
At 8am sharp, he began to unlock the main gate of the PREMIUM TIMES compound, to see how he could sneak in, and infiltrate the entire compound.
Having failed in the night and early morning, at 6:15am he tried again, this time using “WPScan”, which is used to detect vulnerabilities or weak security measures of major websites like PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes he began to attempt to withdraw using modern technology machine intelligence, namely "custom script".
On Saturday he also made every effort to block the PREMIUM TIMES website completely through computer viruses.
How the Farmer Solved the Problem of Weeds:
This plugin user was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had conducted a thorough investigation into the small and large bots that enter the domain of modern communication to close pages or delete content.
This lack of knowledge is what made all the materials he used, all vintage items that could not be faulted or blamed on PREMIUM TIMES.
On this day he encountered difficulty in his journey as he was attacked by a DDOS on the NTP Network Pathway , an ancient route that had been used since the village of Kano.
On March 3rd he tried every trick in the book to calm his mind and nerves, but none of them worked.
This attack on the PREMIUM TIMES headquarters comes just days after PREMIUM TIMES published a report of a power tussle between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.
Some students of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have informed PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired some hackers to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website and to either deface or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the Federal University of Technology, it distanced itself from this attempt to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Hub.
FUTA stated that only if a student is a self-sponsored student at the university should he/she attempt it alone, without FUTA's assistance.

As the Kano State government reduced its budget by about 70 billion naira due to the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the state's economy, the state's House of Assembly enacted a new law governing the management of the state government's finances.
However, city governance groups say that drafting legislation is easy, but implementing it is the challenge.
Establishing a new fiscal framework for government expenditure based on a democratic system is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State which has been established at both the federal and other Nigerian states in recent years.
The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Honorable Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice of America that the law will give employees and the state government guidelines on how to spend their money, as well as how the state will monitor its expenditure.
Now the civic engagement groups have welcomed this law, provided that it is implemented properly.
The Director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement based in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, stated that they hope government officials and the state government will implement the law as it should be.
But the Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Planning, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they have made adequate preparations to work with the new tax regime.
Already, the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has signed this new law last week, and it is expected to take effect soon.

We certainly have all the necessary information about the running projects.
But still we saw it fit to come with our own eyes to see it clearly.
This agency issued a schedule of how the Edo and Ondo elections will be conducted, on February 6th, 2020.
So we have given ourselves almost seven weeks to prepare for the two elections very well.
Today I am pleased to report that we have implemented 10 out of the 14 procedures that INEC had planned to carry out.
And no one was found to be exempt from the day it was to be carried out.
Last but not least is the registration of all voters in one batch for the 14 political parties that will be contesting in the Inji Yakubu election.
He said the four remaining tasks for INEC include issuing the election notice for the coming Tuesday, presenting the list of candidates of each party that will contest the election, all on the same day.
And suspend campaigning 24 hours before the election.
So the campaign will be suspended on Thursday 12th, before the Saturday election.
So we just have to wait for the election day, as we have already done all the preparations.
Hear Jacob.
He however stressed that the Edo state gubernatorial election is the first election INEC will be conducting during the coronavirus period.
He said that the election commission had come up with guidelines on how to conduct the election in this current situation.

Eventually, the Hausa-Fulani reached an agreement of peace between them.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities residing in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have successfully concluded a peace-building conference to foster lasting peace in their area.

The meeting also affirmed the assurance given by the Nigerian government to every Nigerian to reside and move freely in any part of the country, including the Atyap Chiefdom, without fear or any form of molestation from anyone.
The meeting also called on authorities to facilitate the repatriation of all refugees to their homes.
The meeting also suggested the formation of a peace committee comprising the Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youths to organize major rallies and discussions on issues relating to security from time to time for the purpose of promoting peace in their emirate.
A peace and reconciliation meeting is coming up days after the Kaduna State Government imposed a ban on open grazing in the Zangon Kataf and Kaura Local Government Areas of the state to curb inter-communal clashes.
How Ganduje is reinstating the judges that Ado and Sanusi removed, he will reinstate them as rulers in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 Kano State Law, so as to ensure the confirmation of the two major Kano emirs appointed by the late Emir Ado Bayero and Emir Sanusi as major rulers in Kano.
The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Gafasa, read out Governor Ganduje's request before the assembly and it is expected that they will hold a discussion on the matter before the end of July.
The reinstated rulers of the Kano Emirate were Aminu Babba Ɗan'agundi and, who was the Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
Both King Ado and King Muhammad Sanusi removed them , on the charge of treason.
Big Dan'agundi challenged his arrest in court.
The law was enforced for 17 years until the Supreme Court ruled that it should cease.
He also wants Ganduje to succeed him on the throne , and to amend the law to make him one of the crown princes in the Kano Emirate.
Ado Bayero was removed from office in 2003 after being accused of corruption and interference in politics.
A committee was set up to investigate it, but he was invited to appear before the committee to defend himself.
He then appealed it to the High Court of Kano State up to the Court of Appeal.
Before the High Court, the Federal Court of Appeal rendered a judgment to reinstate Aminu Babba to his seat.
But the Kano Emirate under the rule of Muhammad Sanusi II, elevated him, where the Court of Appeal declared the removal of him as the Governor of the West, and the King of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on the 5th of June.
After Sanusi Bayero, Emir of Kano was removed for refusing to accept the appointment of Muhammad Sanusi II as the Sarkin Kano in June 2014.
Later he was appointed Chairman of the National Water Resources Authority under Jonathan's administration.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) Kano State Command has arrested three human traffickers and rescued 71 persons from their custody in the state.
Kano State Command Commissioner Shehu Umar announced this on Friday during an interview with the Nigerian News Agency.

Endeavor, Perseverance and Striving for Excellence is in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In Longyuan Village of Hongsipu Town in Wuzhong City of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northern China.
There is a remarkable woman named Li Yaomei or Sadia (her Muslim name) who is renowned for her struggles in life and her success in overcoming poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort and perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge are all within our hearts.
Initially, neither Li Yaomei nor Sadiya had ever been to school with the intention of receiving an education, which is why she was unable to read or write.
But God gave her wisdom and courage and great insight , where she became an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from a miscarriage, which resulted in her having to undergo surgery 3 times.
After her accident , she encountered a terrible misfortune , and now she is traveling with a cast on her arm.
These challenges she faced put her in a dire situation regarding her health, even to the point of medication costs, which led her to incur a debt of around 3 million Yuan, equivalent to around 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly , this challenge that Malama Sadiya faced opened up a path of self-discovery and transformation for her to improve her life.
Furthermore, the support given by the Chinese government has bolstered her confidence.
Art is the creation of various forms based on the use of materials.
Due to her efforts, the business of tailoring has grown significantly, where different employees are giving her orders for stitching.
In addition, she has created multiple tools to help her streamline the work.
For example , it used to take 15 minutes to assemble one large tent , but now in this time , she can assemble tents up to 5.
In addition, it provides some additional cleaning devices to clean the feed it delivers.
Additionally, there is an engine that purifies animal feed, and now she is even selling these engines to those who are in need.
Considering the challenges that Madam Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her own life and that of her employees, it is clear that she is indeed a seeker and a finder.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of living conditions is not something that rests solely on the government.
If the government continues to provide aid, but people lack the resources or motivation to improve their lives by taking up self-employment based on their current situation, then a vicious cycle will continue without achieving any goal.
The maze indicates that conducting a business or job to earn income does not require any large investments or trips to other cities or foreign countries.
Taking into account the environment she is in, she uses the resources available to her to improve her life.
Furthermore, Madam Sadiya carried out these tasks independently and without relying on her husband, who had left her.
In other words , effort , perseverance , and striving are all in the heart.
He also demonstrated the strength women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone else.
This lesson also shows that whatever one does, one should stand by one's convictions, for relying on another is not certain.
Indeed, Madam Sadiya was a diligent, intelligent and hardworking example and an inspiration to others.
Furthermore, by March of this year, Madam Sadiya had completed payment of all the debts she was owing, and had stopped receiving government assistance on her own accord.

There is Fear American Politicians Will Sabotage Efforts to Contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the measures some countries are taking to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine that is expected to be available, stating that there must be an avoidance of showing favoritism to certain countries while distributing the vaccine.
And the resources should be shared in a fair way around the world, because that would be in line with the greater good of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing the goal of gaining political advantage over their opponents, regarding the distribution of vaccine resources, as well as criticizing the cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already surpassed 23 million.
In terms of numbers , there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease exceeding 800.
Under such dire circumstances , emphasis is being placed on the impact of vaccine technology , and the good news is that , in recent times , significant progress has been made in vaccine research in some countries , giving hope and faith to the entire global population.
But the downside is that some American politicians have shown a desire to seize the oil.
Even the magazine "Science" has reported that the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth more than six billion dollars from various pharmaceutical companies.
Although the intention of the US government is understood, being a leader in the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need access to vaccines, given that they suffer from a lack of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the US achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the amount of emissions that developing countries will be able to produce will decrease.
CDC Africa Director of Disease Control Mr. John Nkengasong also expressed concern about this issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out , even if a vaccine is successfully developed , the goal of seeing beyond the pandemic cannot be achieved unless a plan is devised for distributing the vaccine , which is a matter of great importance to countries around the world.
And it is fitting that the nations of the world should strengthen their cooperation with one another.
WHO Director-General Tedros also emphasized that in order to see the end of the pandemic, it must be stopped everywhere in the world, and that it is not possible for some parts of the world or a few countries to achieve the goal of overcoming the impact of the pandemic alone.

You have been charged by the Buhari government for desecrating the grave of Abba Kyari in court.
A Nigerian rights activist has criticized all the government actions of President Muhammadu Buhari that led to the burial of Abba Kyari.
Kyari, who was the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, was interred at the National Cemetery in Abuja on April 18th, after succumbing to the Coronavirus.
The Prosecutor, Mr. Tope Akinyade, arraigned the Magistrates at the High Court in Abuja, where he sought the court to convict them for violating the anti-kidnapping law enacted by the federal government at the time.
He said there was an unfairness to Nigerians who were being arrested and punished during the lockdown, but for some large groups who broke the law, none of them were held accountable.
He said that if the Buhari government is truly committed to fairness , then he does not see any reason why the poor should be punished if they violate the Corona regulations.
They and some other segments of the government have violated the law but were allowed to.
Among those Tope presented to court are the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Umar.
There is also the Presidential Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, the Social Media Aide to the President, Bashir Ahmed, the Presidential Adviser on Security Matters, Babagana Monguno, the Chief of Army Staff, Mohammed Adamu and many other government dignitaries.
Attorney Celestine Odo argued that the plaintiff had erred since the defendants he was suing had not signed the complaint against them.
However, Tope reminded the Magistrate that he himself had brought the case to court, not the police.
He said that the alkali work would send all those accused of the crime to prison.
For him to do what Nigerian law gives him the right to do in filing a lawsuit.
The Judge adjourned the hearing of the case, saying to return to court on August 4th, to continue hearing.

According to the statement of the party chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they want the president to stop the investigation but to close the issues.

Katsina Government's Fight Against Bandits Is To Protect Poor People, Says Justice Ummaru Abdullahi - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We Must Return To Truth For Peace To Reign In Nigeria.
Former Chief Justice of the Lower Appeal Court, Sharia Lawyer Umaru Abdullahi (Walin Hausa) has stated that the peace agreement between the Katsina State Government and the bandits was a major mistake and a waste of taxpayers' money.
Because it had no effect or sign of ending the armed conflicts that have plagued Katsina state.
Sharia Lawyer Umaru Abdullahi made this known while speaking exclusively to newsmen at his residence in Katsina, including Leadership Today.
After completing the bidding process for the construction of the Women and Children's Ward, a twenty-five bed facility, to be built at the main hospital in the city of Katsina, the Chairman of the meeting adjourned.
The Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Appellate Division, further added that the peace agreement with the insurgents was not properly implemented.
He said that if a terrorist brought a gun to him for two hundred and fifty thousand, and then went back to the bush, he would buy an AK-47 rifle.
The Hausa proverb continues to say that war never brings success, it is better to make peace with them, by improving the lives of the enemies, that is, providing them with places to farm, schools, clean water and health care.
Currently the Livestock Department is located in the northern region, and every year the government allocates funds to farmers only, but excluding breeders, it is necessary to come and make corrections and justice, then peace and stability will be achieved.
But this war will not bring peace to this country, because they are all citizens of this country, peace is the right way.
Do it with good intentions and peace will be achieved.
This affects us all.
Our future generations and environment, how they will live in the future, that is the major issue.
In this world, war has never been fought with a weapon that has been completely finished by a weapon, it is polished on a lathe.
Security experts say that one should not negotiate with terrorists, this is a misguided advice, because even America which says it does not negotiate with terrorists, their terrorists are not Americans, they are people from another country carrying out attacks.
We are also these country's riflemen , so to speak , and there will be no peace with them.

The President of South Africa Has Condemned the Violence Against Women.
The President of South Africa has expressed his dismay at the corruption that has plagued the ruling ANC party in the country.
In a letter dated Sunday 23 August, sent to all members of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa began by condemning the corruption that has been taking place in the allocation of funds to help the country fight the coronavirus pandemic.
What has brought about this self-sufficiency is the presence of independent companies and individuals, including government officials who use the problem of medical supplies, social relations and economic resources to benefit themselves, according to the letter.
This betrayal of millions of South Africans by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing hunger daily, and lack of employment, will not be forgiven.
In his letter, Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of the country's funds had been discovered that should be used to improve transportation, provide basic necessities to the poor, and improve the quality of electricity, help small-scale farmers who are struggling, and develop the country as a whole, which the thieves had stolen and put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said that people should not think that the ANC is only a way to gain power, wealth, or fame.

The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics announced that the country's economy has seen a rebound that has not been seen in the past 10 years, following a rebound of more than 6 percent seen between April and June of this year.

The agency listed the causes of the problem, including mandating people to stay at home, banning air travel, prohibiting flights, closing schools and businesses.
The agency added that taking such measures in countries around the world has caused the price of oil to drop, while factories have been shut down in countries around the world to tackle the problem.
Last May, Nigeria's Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said that the Bureau of Statistics had forecasted such a situation, due to these problems that have prevented the conduct of daily activities, which has forced the government of the country to adopt austerity measures.

He said the company had been dormant for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was unlikely to revive its intention, which then gave the order to remove N78.8 million to repair the important components of the company with an additional N48 million to operate it, which gave the company the opportunity to take off again.

On the other hand , he said , "We are facing some challenges , due to the fact that the company has been shut down for more than 10 years while the engines have started to work but we need to modify some equipments in order to be able to operate without any fear".
Before our work commences, we will endeavor to bring in the other materials we require.
