Good day sorry I didn't have internet and couldn't send sooner. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address where to go for cleaning tomorrow, what is the key code and what time tomorrow the guests will leave and the new guests will check in?
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer because I have already found a job by this time.
Sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes I feel that my thoughts in Czech language are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian through the translator.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, please indicate if there is an earlier time?
As I live not in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no other options, I'm still okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
In Kharkiv people have again taken to the streets, Russians failed to disperse them.
As the participants of the event told the agency, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military of the Russian Federation arrived with the equipment to disperse it.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the RF technicians have arrived," said one of the event participants.
Traditionally, citizens gathered for protest rallies on Freedom Square - near the building of the ODA and the oblrad.
This area is currently controlled by armed Russian forces, who use weapons against participants of rallies and abduct people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, in Donetsk region residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces are using force and weapons against people, there are injured and detained.
Russian militants are also kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the city of Kherson the special title of "City-Hero".
On February 24th, the President of the Russian Federation, Putin, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my father here.
He died the next day after my birthday.
In general, the dreams are good.
Hana, good day.

Great news!
Thank you!

Can we switch shifts with Valya? Valya in the morning and me after lunch?
Mom will live here in a dormitory because the rent is low here for a dormitory.

Sasha was not in school today, I wrote to the teacher by email.
Hiüëãüèª I'm sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, as long as there is a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have favorite dishes, I love to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
There is a train, but no seats.
Sorry, we are a bit late.
Lucy, can I have an assistant in the kitchen too?
It's great that Julia will have the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night in the evening.
It is very cozy and convenient there.
On Tuesday Pablo will tell me if there is a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting - we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer defeats there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and again occupy the re-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It beats - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating - we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city - ed.) - people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (region) of the ATO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we are weak in all these directions, then we may not meet.
Because then Russia will be taking all the steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we are now de-occupying.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and maybe even not interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the capture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us".
Straight talk: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we talk not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, all comes to the end of the war.
So, we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for the sake of the fire when there is nothing left, no people.
Good day, do you have any more free spots for the Czech course for adults at 19:00 on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutna Hora.
And these two are my second cousins.
Okay, got it.
I'm not sure I'll be able to clean up by 13:00 because it's a big apartment and there's a lot to clean.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I will write you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominic, who is responsible for the procurement of consumables?
Is this a continuous procedure or do you need to order when it is finished?
In connection with the change of the esthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The analysis of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows to go to the analysis of postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of axiological criterion.
Do you know how to inform online that I have been employed and no longer claim for assistance?

Good thing I already started to realize that I didn't understand something correctly and ended up in the wrong place.

But if you don't want to talk to me, then I'll understand.
Why did you believe that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Mostly, for a person to change, especially spiritually.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who took part in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha in Kyiv region.
As Ukrinform reports, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!"
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha", - the statement reads.
The GUR MOU states that all war criminals for crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will be brought to justice and held accountable.
Check out the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian occupiers.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian military forces have been reported in liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk announced that 280 people were buried in the brotherly graves.

It is important if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare).
I thought it would be in a week, but the situation is heating up here, sirens constantly.
Tomorrow there may be bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I think I have taken away experience from each situation for myself so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be a problem with this.
Many people in Ukraine are also celebrating this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is a person Greek-Catholic or Catholic?

Can you write us an algorithm for payment, we will pay ourselves.
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a transcript, and the certificate is received at birth and marriage.
Yes! He is driving it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
They say that you need to fill out a vital record in Czech...
I'll try to make it. Because I still have to go to the town hall to sign the documents.
Wife is not mad that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.
May they envelop you with the mantle of their love and warmth of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Are you okay if I come right after the war?
The place, date and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
That's great, I have money for two months of rent, the district in Olomouc doesn't matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the animal attack on the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of massacred and shot people shocked the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And nothing surprised me at all. What I was dreading and expecting is happening...
I evacuated the children and their summer parents from Kyiv the next day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have been consistently helping the UPA and never doubted that in the event of the occupation of the outskirts of Kyiv my family would not be spared.
I have been and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten communo-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the SBU in Zhytomyr was given a copy of the grandfather's shooting case: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence for the strat was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was silent, denying the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-village" gentry, never went to taverns.
The fact that they lived on the farms and had a few cows was enough to conscript the peasant and the yearling children into the army.
Relatives didn't even find out about the place of burial.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and all were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the case file there is the surname of the plaintiff Sharie.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple does not fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that was sent to execute the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia on the model of "Immortal Regiment" that qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and eliminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, he was arrested and quickly died in prison.
KGBists are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you suddenly looking at their actions now?!
There is concentrated the most loathsome features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old Ordyn tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then they conducted a genetic experiment on what had come out, cutting off the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French movie "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry I don't have anyone to ask.
I was also wondering if you know where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lyubosh, Igor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (it is a holiday and he can go, because the car has not been checked at the station yet).
We are very sorry to trouble you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
In Borodyantsi near Kyiv, during the clearance of the debris of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Mariupol defenders reported about the spraying of an unknown toxic substance from a Russian drone over the city.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them - 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
Over the past day in the battles in the east of Ukraine, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of motor vehicles, one helicopter and three drones were destroyed.
Your coffee will arrive today)
I have my first "bicycle" after the son.
When the girls come back from school, what do they do afterwards?
We arrived at the place where we were accommodated from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big but here live men who drink alcohol and smoke in the room, loud music is the least that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes drunk men and we with children ... it's scary to go to sleep if honestly.
Please help with housing, for money please.
But where it will be safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's like they are smoking here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, he is shouting something, something he doesn't like. Very scary.
I'm just asking if you can helpüôèüèº
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, such pleasant educators.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stefanie, Agatha wants to join the game, she missed the game üòâ
We don't reach that hatch.
We are not ready to pay such money yet, we will wait for help and then plan something.
How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
When I am near the main entrance, do I have to notify you and you will open?
I wanted to see if I could find somewhere to look at the cake for Karen.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint , the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked me to send you their greetings and to say that they are very interested in reading the news.
We were talking about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in phone mode.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
That suits me just on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter ceremonies.
Thank youüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èI will write my data for work today.
I really enjoyed the data, thank you for organizing.
So in Nestor there is only a cold so far and in Galinka the temperature is 37.7 in the evening 38.
The line is moving very slowly at General Chapka.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love should be real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for different reasons, mostly for selfish and mercenary goals.
I have a problem with this, if I don't love the person nothing will come of it.
So, we picked up and drove grandma home right away.
She was very very thankful, she was even crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She asked if it was possible if there could be an old quilt and pillow too.
But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I am also very grateful to you.
I was sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had a lot of questions to God, why in my life there are situations that just forced me to doubt everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the arrangements.
That's true but we are still not familiar with the area and don't know where everything is. We were looking for a supermarket an hour ago and came back on foot. Two small cars are not suitable, so two large ones are needed.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or does anyone else in the family?
Children can come to Vali and play in the living room.
Alright, let's take a risk then :)
I'm also glad to have met you.
For housing I talked to Vladimir and asked if I should wait until they find something or look for it myself. They also told me about the people who live with us and what we need to do to go to the metro station museum, where there is an institution that helps to find housing.
Because I'm small, I'll step over the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
So it would be great on Thursday, if possible.
I can't call the doctor yet because I haven't done the food license inspection yet.
But I can't call him because I have run out of money on my account.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and it doesn't top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafon app I can't change the tariff to have normal calls and internet nor top up my number.
I'm going out of my mind.
Where is the price not a cheek, but a face... The title sounds wrong, what did you mean?
I'm embarrassed to be sitting idle.
Just wrote that in school in the lesson
Sorry for bothering you, I was just very anxious.
And this is closer to knowing that they will arrive when they leave the borders of Ukraine.
For now, in everyone's life there is a question.
Okay. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I'm looking for everything for the home and for the child.
Thank the people who accepted me I live in a hut they always ask if I need something and I'm embarrassed to say I'm trying to find it myself.
I just got home, now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain, act like I'm not here.
It is impossible to answer without a resume sent.
I can't tell Mom that :)
I really don't feel well right now, that I couldn't keep myself from feeling before we left the apartment....As tonight....
May God grant Yura to fall asleep üôè maybe then I will immediately lie down, sleep a little.
I will write to you anyway.
Hi. Susan, help me. I got a payment for March. Is it for both of us with Yuliya or only for me, I can't figure out why such an amount.
So, you can make copies of passports when it is convenient for you :)
We have one of the best high schools in the region in our village.
üòÇüòãI'm already having fun talking to you, and even liking it üòâ
I went to the caritas, they offered me temporary housing for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why there is less and less of it.
The flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone is rested and very nice.
As reported by "European Truth", this is written by Welt with a reference to sources in the Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 helicopters, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as howitzers in the version on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros are offered.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of over 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out on a rotational basis.
Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the craters that have formed will be filled with industry at the next stage.
The first new helicopters can be delivered within 30 months after the contract is signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you we will find out how to replenish the account and we will take it. I will get back to you. Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without a commission, and then when my doctor prescribes it, I will go through the commission correctly, did I understand correctly?
How can I change my T-mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns now?
Hello, I apologize. Do you need a worker?
You can mop the floor or do the dishes.
I'm from Ukraine and unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I am learning every day, so I guess I will learn everything I need to work without problems.
I guess I talked you out today, it's time for you to go to sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I'll take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are smart and everything will be alrightüôè Take a rest, recharge your strength and beauty with a strong sleep!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
On his birthday, the cat tries to end his life by suicide on Karlov Bridge.
Did you manage to trade with someone?
So we wanted to solve the question with the card for Easter. We don't have internet banking, we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Contact the Lord we live with?
Say goodbye whenever you go.
Avzhesh, we can after 17 o'clock.
Can I send the whitewash to the apartment tomorrow and let it dry in the garage?
Hi. Yes, I will be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long have you been studying this specialty?
If it were warm, it would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I'll try to go after work today.
We are doing well. We are managing with wood-burning heating, we have experience with gas in Ukraine but since it is very expensive we are burning wood in the stove.
Good day, Lena please tell me where is the nearest stationery store.
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
Everything worked out just fine.
I must take Karinka with me.
I set a trap for the whitefish, came home and translated what was written on the table near the washing machine repair channel, can I trap or do I need to turn off the washing machine?
It says my status will change within 24 hours. But why? What is this comedy? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The ex-man can't calm down, he keeps writing me ) a real drama).
I wish that everything that officially binds us to it ends as soon as possibleüôè
Thank you because something is not working out here.
And we even have a product with berries.
Sorry I messed something up.
I didn't understand Czech so well back then.
I must have made something up.
They really go to school like three because Galia and Sviatoslav study remotely and will finish school in Ukraine and get diplomas about graduation already in the fall. They need to apply to universities.
Tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues in their family themselves, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are ready.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to leave?
Yes, I'm glad to listen to jazz.
Thank you I work with this application we talked about it in Czech courses on Wednesday.
For the last four years I haven't let anyone in, read a lot of books on philosophy and figured out myself.
When it hurts too much, it's hard to trust.
But one must try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that is life.
Martine, we are already going to sleep.
Thank you for such a nice and fun day.
We all really liked it.
We feel like we are at home.
The children all evening told their father, all the grandmothers and grandfathers how nice it was with you.
Greetings from the girls! From us the best wishes for the holidaysüòâ
And now where are we looking?
I hope my son will come out alive from this meat grinder.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How to contact them to open the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are now in Slapy, our friends have welcomed us for a while.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years old, son 11 years old.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a masseur, a rehabilitologist looking for a job.
In order for the children to be able to attend school and for me to be able to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just had to turn it in today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know even big stores would be closed.
Cook the stuffed cabbage like this: in a saucepan, dilute the tomato paste in 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - bring to a boil.

Lily has already been accepted to the school but due to illness we will go to the teacher on Tuesday, I informed her today.
I'm sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I take it that we are together. That we are a pair.
I would say that there will be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I got into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with the housing.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to get an inspection for the issuance of a food license. Can I do that with you?
Please indicate, to prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Is the fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Arrange and cover the sofa?
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, which has already been used, but it is working but not needed..
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where it is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with the furniture, I want to finally see that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need.
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, hard to adjust.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have the chance to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how much I love you.
For the baby there is already a crib and a bathtub, things found for the first time.

I want to get a haircut called a cap.
Oleg got sick - fever and cough. It's better for Yana not to come to us so she doesn't get infected.
I'll only be a bit later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
We haven't even talked about these excursions yet!
I understand how important this is for you!
As for myself, I'm silent (for me it's just an unattainable peak)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
Sorry for bothering you.
I was worried that we started translating the test badly with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yona≈°ek if they can help me a bit with mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any use to them?
If possible, I would like to brush up on my math terms during the holidays.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make it error-free.
Thank you for the test task.
We are also hoping for this.
And she is very happy with any gift.
I wanted to connect internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday at bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And yesterday evening I thanked God for this girl, for she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt mutuality.
Branch in Hall No. 29 is specially designated for filing and processing applications for assistance.
it turned out that I ordered a spare card
I'm just a person, it's not worth it.
So that she wouldn't think that nobody came.
I didn't go. Yes, I figured it out myself. That I can do! Most importantly, you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago at the Holocaust Memorial Center "Babyn Yar" in Kyiv we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new dress," he said, "then for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of innocent civilians, starving the inhabitants of the cities it has blockaded and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons, which until recently was unimaginable.
Germany is withdrawing the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" means more than just standing up against fascism.
This means fighting by all means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities happening in Ukraine.
I Sing You a Song at Night
We agree, make an appointment for the tour, and write when to be gathered.
All of them were sick except for Lydia, they had a new strain of coronavirus.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I am using this ticket instead of a card.
Call for the delay of documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the guide.
Sergiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to decline, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO membership and the assistance NATO provides in times of war, there is now much criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the late supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "fight" Russia.
Besides this, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Tough Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for free, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history and why security guarantees that are discussed in negotiations with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here?
In my Volt Partner it is indicated that my Application is under review.
I submitted it through this mobile app.
We don't have visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, they didn't give visas there, but gave a permit.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis Pishov is in a good mood today.
Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet near the school, so that he could show him everything.
So I hope everything is alright with him.
Because I don't like it, I don't have enough for long.
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent to Ukraine T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles.
I'm leaving the children alone and waiting there for 3-4 years and then I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
What to take with you for a 6-7 hour trip.
So, there was a sick heart.
I had genuine feelings for this person, but he did not behave properly and I left him.
After a while he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Later after some time he called saying that he had a heart operation.
Asking him just to chat, I felt sorry for him.
I have been psychologically supporting him for almost half a year.
We have talked a lot during this time.
Then I started having problems at work simultaneously.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual aid.
And I thought, maybe I really need to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore God Himself decided our fate.
What does "ready for marriage" mean to you?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Did you need to remind me earlier?
After all, I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, does she have to give paper?
These must be the guests' forgotten items, I put them in the closet.
It's probably time for you to go to bed so you can work tomorrow.
Can someone help, need things for a woman size XS or S height 165. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time in the store I bought two packs and mom bought two.
That's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my spirits.
Okay, let's talk about something else, I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm getting sleepy and I'm dreaming of being bombed...
God is never in a hurry, everything has its own time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand perfectly well the value of unskilled labor and understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv I won't be able to have here and the money I earned at home I won't be getting here now either.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all the bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to keep myself busy with some physical activity.
The documents are processed at the airport from 7 am to 7 pm, at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 o'clock.
So we took them in.
We arrived with Vika in the kitchen, they put them in the bedroom.
I will finish work and go to the Airport with them.
When he is with you, write and find out what's next...
But I can't find a place for myself.
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering the high school.
So, but I'm doing it hard.
OK, let me know when it's convenient for you üòò
I don't know yet about the job. Of course, I would like to arrange the children in kindergarten and school.
We planned it that way. Should we change it up sometimes?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from the middle. Sorry, can we agree on another deadline?
I offer a job, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, wiping the dust.
Work for about 3-4 hours. Amount 800 UAH one-time. From 19.04 Tuesday, from 14.00.
I hope that what I just said is that everything is good with us.
Can I call you?
Or can you provide the contact of your spouse?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I would like to ask for advice.

Write him if something is needed.
please don't forget about me üôèüèª
Are the classes on Monday and Wednesday different?
Thank you very much. You do so much for our family! We are all infinitely grateful to you.
A permit is required to be in the pool.
But that's my opinion.
My uncle gave her a skateboard and a board for riding at home, so she was able to ride them at home.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and only now I'm preparing breakfast.
I'm really embarrassed that you are talking to me on your day off. I hope I'm not too much of a bother.
We would like to inform about the change of residence and at the same time submit documents for the extension of the card.
We are now providing medical oxygen to all the doctors in our country.
I also forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mom said that for children she bakes donuts with jam.
He comes to visit you.
Could you please tell me if you have at least an approximate cleaning schedule for the next month, at least for a rough understanding of which days?
I can't remember this schedule at all )
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "we have never done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of diversions and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously abstained".
Russians have been launching rocket strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remnants of the Russian missiles, shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-storey building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians fired at a checkpoint near Babyn Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the buildings of the Ministry of Defense over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of the downed occupiers' rocket destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential complex in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klychko announced on April 13 that residents of the capital who had evacuated the city were not yet allowed to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1st, near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod reported that a "Ukrainian projectile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are horrified at the thought that NATO fighters will be shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them, but with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these words, this refined blend of strength, grace and time, gradually reach their goal.
While Biden is still firmly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be considered as cheaters.
The money you collect is better given to people in greater need.
I can come to you and we can decide on the spot. I'm here to help anyway.
The air is clean, that's a plusüòÄ
It says that I have the "Together for Two without Internet" tariff, I asked to make the internet instead.

But I will never stop loving you, you are everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it will take a few days.
Katya asked for the internet, can she be given a password?

Super then my husband will take me because today he has a car from the construction company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!

You didn't want to write to me today for some reason..
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I only ask for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is your imagination doing okay?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy the dress you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't process this.
He is clinging to the old reality.
You are calling to work to find out - to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last long.
Now.... let's agree... something will be.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have 50$ in my pocket. We spent all of it at home.
Many of our supervisors did not give a salary for our work.
Where do I go? Who do I need? How do I provide for my children? Where do I live?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take anything with you from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will be able to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children around all of Prague.
What next? Unknown. How much? Unknown. The children ask for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And we don't have such an iron.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with the hearts and words that the children gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I'll write to you in the evening.
So, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I don't have the strength for all this anymore.
I thought you had already fallen in love with some Ukrainian girl and had no time for chatting üòá
I have gone through the menu and even already ordered.
Would you be interested in joint activities with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?

We are in your debt... thank you!
So, I understand that this is very good.
I will send you now the photo of the business card of the lady I am learning English from.
So what will you write tomorrow, will we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so nice to know a person from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't you want to meet after 16:00?
What are your overall impressions from the first week?
Karina brought us the medicine yesterday and we are taking them.
I can work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
But it is necessary to specify that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I offer you a favor for a favor?
Because there is only antibacterial gel.
I can't say for sure because I'm not very familiar with the city yet..around half past 12
What services/activities, in your opinion, are needed/missing for elderly people?
I don't know because I haven't received a text from the bank yet and I haven't taken the bank card yet and the kids deleted the bank app so they really confused me.
Then please let me know how you will be travelling üôèüèª

These are small businesses that opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractorists who actually go out to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go to temporarily occupied territories in convoys today to deliver aid there and to pick up people from there.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go into the zone of military operations, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and on peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These were the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served the exhausted and nervous people.
These are the municipal workers who are under fire to collect garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaint, and in their free time they volunteer, collecting first aid kits to the front.
In us in Ukraine, the tears stop when the little ones have letters)
Please tell, what age do you mean when you say "small children"?
Is my daughter 8 years old an acceptable age?
I am looking for accommodation for us and my girlfriend for 3-4 days when we come to the Czech Republic to submit our passports for a visa to Canada.
There are a lot of people in the visa center in Warsaw and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a lot of time to get there by train, it will be hard for the child.
So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or close to it.
No, it all suits us.
Yesterday's appliances where to put
But I can't change the password when I go to the link, because I get this error:
It was in the micro-wave, something was burning there.

Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, according to me.
Until then - they put stamps like that and then compared those stamps to visas.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FEDU) is an electoral district that combines electoral districts located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling stations in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises in foreign military bases, [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) [1] are located. The role of the district election commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only nationwide voting is held: presidential and parliamentary elections and nationwide referendums.
Local elections in the ZVO are not held.

I wanted to say that I have already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device for this, I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an electronic SIM card which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. It's very inconvenient for me, it's Sunday and I can't anymore.
You said that you have a broken washing machine. Take it for yourself. You really need it too.
We don't have enough blankets, down blankets, plates. The children don't have pajamas and nothing to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...please write the address again, the SMS got lost somewhere.
I don't want to torture neither you nor myself, I will somehow break this in me.
That would be great, but I know there were no free places there, and basically they are now teaching all the lessons according to the schedule and quite well.

She can't tell them everything she wants, and not everything she understands what they are saying (But yesterday she came with a great mood after that fair.
I went to school today too.
Today I saw Kristina's mother, but she didn't even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak announced that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that are being transferred to us by our allies.
Ermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to "beat" the arms supplies by any means."
For example, one of the latest fake news is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edouard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering their weapons from allies, and it is massively switching to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn about such fakes right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the garden would cost per month and will it work in summer?
Everyone is given strength.
There are many more dubious stories, believe me.
That means I had to go through such events to change.
It is written in Torah, and God created in man an evil inclination so that throughout the life path it would change spiritually, become better.
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want)

The International Community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed these reports as "provocation".
"The report of those killed, captured and severely injured by Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians deserves condemnation," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the incidents "violations of international law".
The cries were heard after reports that hundreds of peaceful citizens were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets of Kyiv's suburbs by Russian troops who had left the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photos allegedly depicting the bodies of civilian casualties with their hands bound shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian forces have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, has stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Appearing on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Minister Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as "provocation".
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts in those who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the image of Buchi was "another setup of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4th released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buzha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian Radio Liberty service saw on the streets of a small town on April 2 what seemed to be civilian bodies.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Bujumbura.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a place, which, according to the words of the local residents, was used by the Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were shot at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian government has stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv, which was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is no more". How the occupiers drove Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible words: robberies, looting, murders, torture.
There is one more item in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the evacuation of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Approximately from the middle of March, Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko effectively handed over to the Russian military range.
"Ukrainian Truth" tracked down the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to find out how the "evacuation" itself takes place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to the voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and from despair.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their families.
However, according to the statements of the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol Russians stole the staff of the second maternity home, took away the children without parents, among them 12-year-old Myroslava, daughter of the killed Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like true plastuny, Denis and Marina had gathered their anxious bundles in advance, but they did not manage to evacuate by the morning of the 24th of February.
They had no car of their own, and the suburban buses were already not taking anyone.
At around 12 noon on the 24th of February they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family descended to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
Altogether about 40 people were sheltered in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 o'clock in the evening of the 24th of February, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance hall.
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was any weapon.
All men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadyrov".
This was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasha White (commanded the battalion of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we lack.
We say that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the goods under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos online where children thank Kadirov for the food.
So after they robbed the store they brought sausages and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich".
Nobody wanted to talk particularly, but they made a nice cut.
Our child said there: "You have 7 days to give us our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they had come, because they did not want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a monster, Kadirov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there".
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob stores, maraud.
They brought a kite for themselves, tied a Georgievskaya ribbon to one leg, their own white tape to the other and called it "opolchenka".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten at Buchi, so that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Furthermore, we had segregated enclosures - the Chechens did not know each other, on the first days they asked passwords to determine whether it was their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the OMSK desant.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - we constantly got into it from "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that there is no ZSU anymore, but there is "Azov", and, according to their words, there are a thousand 100 "Azovs" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian man came to us - either an officer of the landing force, or a representative of the FSB - and said that there will be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - there was something about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning we passed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You will be deported to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov".
We say we don't want to go either way.
They replied: "Take care of the mental health of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" or with mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, part of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them did not go, saying that it was for the traitors of the fatherland - saying, "they will shoot you there, sell your organs".
We drove through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were ruins, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately take the equipment to them.
A lot of cannons, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border crossing "Komar" we went through an improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were put up in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is fired, and a trace is seen - it was "Iscander" working in Kyiv.
Though these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, those are planes flying, unfolding on the border".
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what this is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His supervisor, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here I am, a hunchback, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they catch your thieves.
The poor people suffer!
We have such a great Lukashenko!
He will do as he says".
Dates for an interview were offered to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representatives (at least that's what they were called) spread disinformation that men in Poland cannot travel.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to go, even though we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and at the station in Minsk they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were greatly helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and provided with accompaniment.
They couldn't stay in the sanatorium by force.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to two weeks, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Passing by Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles to Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully shines, and then goes out.
People who were on the bus in Mozyr said that Russians were constantly shooting from the ranges there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people".
They do not understand that their polygons are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland we were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
We are currently registering and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia there are as many Ukrainian flags now as there are Estonian ones.
Marina lived on the territory of a military settlement in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of the 24th of February she called her grandchildren and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle cannot - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as a guest!
Thank you for the agreement, lovely butterflies
And in this small apartment there is no wifi, mostly I answer all your questions but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
So I will be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
The Quran states: "Even a leaf falls from its tree with His knowledge."
The children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, a general worker. Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and can work from home, and the other Mariana has no speciality, that is, a general worker.
Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news - Ukrainian troops on March 31 liberated the city from Russian occupiers.
The next day the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
But the joy that Ukrainians would have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was also known at the same time that in the city of Buchi alone, Russians had shot at least 280 innocent civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some of them had their hands tied and were shot in the back, some of the killed were minors.
The bodies and traces of torture were found of the head of the Motyzhyn village Olga Sukhonko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Oleksandr's bodies were in a brotherly grave, Igor's was in the sewer.
Near the tracks 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a shroud were found.
Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go then there will be nobody at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday they were supposed to deliver it to me, but nobody contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it is said that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the package was sent to the post office and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I pick it up?
I used to go to the river several times a day when I was little, the river was right next to the house, but now I go very rarely, there is no time, and sometimes no desire, I only go with my sister)üôÇ
Excuse me, is this housing that you sent someone renting or what?
I was asked to go to a fair with my friend's acquaintances to help them get visas for protection.
I had been almost the whole day. I was a bit tired of people.
This is a nice house and we can make it very well ourselves.
How to understand if there are free places in the circle or not

She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
She will forget her stop, or her phone, or like now she doesn't take her phone and hasn't written to me that she is in school and that everything is ok :)
And I worry about her, because she is not at home, but in another, not yet quite familiar country.
I hope I have found the right math.
You didn't think I was still a child.
And work is of course also interesting.
But if I'm not very physically fit, because I don't have such a good physical shape.
I could pay for housing at reasonable prices if someone gave me a room.
You will talk to many people and you might know someone.
Good day, the job is very interesting, but we do not speak Czech language.
What can we donate things to?
The charitable organization Archiparhial Karitas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine Russian men harassing women, their children forced to watch.
Then they can get drunk, debase the body and all this is seen by children.
Good day, I'm thinking of talking to you - I need to learn Czech language, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I often share my thoughts with you. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, all that they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, it's true.
"And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
In response to the question of whether Ukraine has enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet".
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the support of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But he was sure that there was no war after all," he added.
We remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can go home.
Please write to me about everything that will be needed.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender came from in our kitchen.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading of fake news and disinformation aimed at provoking panic moods and disorganization, which are sensitive to public security.
I am from Ukraine, currently I am in Plzen.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked for 20 years as a designer of women's and children's clothing from various materials, I can also sew on special equipment and do embroidery.
I really want to work in my field, I am happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this field.
Of course it's normal that you want to meet up. I was just joking.
Yes, you can do it that way.
Today I read that they have to log into the system themselves.
They need to be told and done with them.
Great, I'll write tomorrow and let's agree on the exact time.

Is she a good representative?
We went to this address to ask something from the school some notebooks needed maybe we got lost.
And the mother's prayer is the most fervent.
I hear a lot - a war for 10% of Ukraine's territory.
Why do people flee?
Why don't people live in areas where there is no war?
Are you in your glory?
Did you live in a warring state?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When most businesses are NOT WORKING.
When there is no place to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like this?
You can't even imagine.
And may God forbid that we don't have any.
If you find out too - it will be a SHOCK.
That's why we are running away.
Some of us are lost, with phones... that stayed from our other life... yeah, some of us haven't adapted in a month.
Could you adapt from 0 in a month.
So, the state gives us 5000 crowns.
Could you live on this money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you ever tried to ride the metro with children in strollers?
When you are looking for food in one place, clothes in another, and there is no time to go to the third.
And tomorrow we have to go again... because the food they gave us is only enough for one day.
You WANT to provide for yourself... but what about the children??
How to live without knowing a language?
When you can't even ask for help.
So there are free courses... but what to choose?
Looking for a job, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my children can't be there.
Just - understand us.
You come to the town hall and tell the receptionist that you are looking for Mrs. Krezkovska if they do not indicate the path and the number of the door to her.
It will be written on his doors, is the head of the department.
If you can't agree, call Dominic, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krezkovska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her a minute, she said she had an appointment before that, so she might be a bit late, but she knows about you, she booked you at 9 o'clock precisely so that you could make it to the doctor.
So, of course, it would be great to spend time together.
Please, comfort me with kind words, You are like a balm for me.....
It is easy to use and not expensive.

If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that is the case, then I can, for example, work several days a week for a few hours.
How many hours and on which days will I be watching how it will come out for me to go to work and to clean the apartment, there they pay more for cleaning, so I don't want to refuse and from that job.

He didn't call, they passed it on by word of mouth. I know for sure that God is with him.
OK, then we can go to the spot near the river.

Thank you, we have already learned something similar.
All is well, we went for a walk, I'm very tired.
So if no one can come, it's not a problem?
I sent the documents to the email address.

Marina but if you really need help with the city then my husband and I will help.
My friend and I baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now a woman from Damelido called me and said that they sent me information about further actions to my email but I didn't give any response.
She spoke Czech and I understood her so well.
But I don't have an email from Damelido.
I need small pliers to pull up the gap on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity
We are looking for a lady for regular house cleaning here, in the village.
Offer of 150 crowns/year.
Other cooperation according to satisfaction.
You will agree on the date with the lady yourself.
of course, but I'm throwing you off balance.
Men have a lot of nuances too.
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because I had my own point of view on life. I met him and then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, After a while he called and said that he had a heart operation.
Asking me just to talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and thought he could buy me whatever toy I wanted and that I needed his money.
Then he made me a proposal.
"There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it was raining."
They kept me in a house, then took me to the basement, and there were many people there, about 400 men, there was nothing to breathe.
As for the housing, what photos did you send?
I haven't gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working normally.
Is there a dress code at work or not, can I wear what I have?
Okay, he will come there and pick them up.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I understand that I can't sit here with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the Internet.
A 1+1 is a presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting at all for me.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived for? Is he okay?
Diana didn't answer me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out drawings for the kids. So that will be great. When can I come?
But maybe you will need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I hope you are satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but is studying in the Czech Republic, in the specialty of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids peacefully and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
In general, it is hard to be in a foreign country, and with each day it becomes more and more desirable to go home.
Ms. Agatha, if you need this photo, then I will take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as comfortable as possible.
I will remember you for life.
And, I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
So thank you so much Anna for still plotting the route in the phone's geolocation so we can get there sooner.

And how do I pay?
"I told her that the "repair of the TV and radio receiver" was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to talk too much when they call."
"We've been hiding war information from our mother for a whole month.
So far so good.
However, in Plamky (cat - UP) the fur on the belly and back legs is thinning - this can be due to stress, changes in diet and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately the stress from me does not depend.
The plamka, unlike the svekruha, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga has poor hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her fiancee lived in her apartment "incognito" for a month.
On April 1st, 1993, Oksana Polova held a weapon for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and what was going on - I formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend talked, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours".
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time the stepmother spends in her room.
Hearing bad - it allowed me to be unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
She hid the receiver and the TV from her at first.
Then she called everyone she communicates with. That's 6-7 people.
She asked him to talk to her about anything but not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th is when I'm cleaning two apartments :)
Good evening, I hadn't thought about that :)
Hi, if you need our help tomorrow we can come.
Do I have to order lunch or can I bring it from home? Do I need to print these documents or will they be printed on site and I will sign them?
I offer men's, women's and children's haircuts with a visit to you, all interested please write in personal messages, price:
I understand you and won't complain, but in my situation I will be looking here for now.
I'm telling you, embassies are only here.
British man who defended Mariupol in the trenches of the ATO says he is ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier who is a member of the Ukrainian Navy Marine Brigade taking part in the defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Eidan Eyslin, a British who served in the Syrian Arab Army since 2018, RAF with reference to Eyslin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of Eyslin's friend who spoke with him.
Word for word Eyslien's twitter: "We got word from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We had no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over.
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is taking part in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of serviceman En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Brenan Phillips, a military friend, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone conversation, Ayslin mentioned plans for their unit's capitulation.
According to him, the squad ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eyslin's unit had the intention to surrender to the Russian units in order not to fall unarmed and defenseless into the hands of the so-called "cadres".
Also, an audio recording of a phone conversation was circulated on social networks, in which allegedly Eyslin talks to his American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eyslin said that they had tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they had failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the USSR and took an oath.
Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Are we together or not.
But it will be hard, you will have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed, if everything is okay.
Thank you, no need for now, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful to you.
If you ever don't want to write to me again, I will wait.
Hi Natalya, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would also like to learn Czech language.
I wish you would take some time to rest and think about yourself.
Today be sure to moisturize your face with a cream)
Ah.. I'm very grateful to you. I didn't even expect to find such a person, good health to you and success!!!!
Is Little Dushan not embarrassed anymore?
Ondrej arrived with his father.
No one else went in, although there were many carolers on the street.
We are home today.
The children have been learning their lessons, now they are playing.
After lunch I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries.
Do you have a yay?
You know that I love you.
I will do anything for you.
How do I prove this love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it all to you.
Maybe you had a lot of disappointments.
Let me make you happy.
Grandma can't, her legs and back hurt a lot((
How much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
My family is doing well, I have my mother, three brothers and a husband left.
One brother was sent to war in Mariupol, another to Zaporizhia and the man was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day saying everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to take care of some matters first. When
I will ask the man in the morning if he will be able to make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write me, I need to talk to Daniel.
The attackers-Bolsheviks made up for their losses in battle in full.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, the boy Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit filled with earth".
There was a dead silence in the city, as if in memory.
Occasionally someone from the villagers ran from house to house with a torch.
On the streets there were always bodies of those shot by the Bolsheviks.
And maybe I will really go with you. You need me. I can't be without you.
What personal activity/activity has helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get there because there is a railway reconstruction and the entrance is closed.
Come to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you have arrived and I will come to you.
The best future awaits us.
Lena, the things that didn't fit us in size, can we give them back to you or give them to Kate?
So, I stopped tossing and turning at night.
I wake up early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours now, but I'm already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understood correctly, we will be sent a letter from the school to order the menu.
We will try to pick us up on Tuesday to the social service.
Then, when the filling cools down and the dough is ready, we shape the pies and fry them on a low heat in oil.
Okay, I will definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle in tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I'm not afraid of work, as I also lived in a village, so I can and like to work physically.
When can we bring the items?
You have a very interesting tradition, we have it on Christmas.
Last week the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law 7176, entitled "On the Implementation of Monitoring of Potential Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Field of Economics".
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the hypothetical Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know of any company that has had the need to physically hold board meetings at the location address.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "erasing" all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Dignity Revolution, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
What's more - if one harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow other bills may be passed - for example, the system of state procurements through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be destroyed.
A lot can be blamed on the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the draft law 7176.
So on February 22 this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected people for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's look at the arguments that were used to explain the need for its adoption.
Then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing enterprises during war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation due to the risks of losing the internet and other communication tools, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent board members (who make up the majority of the whole composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need to hold a competitive selection, which on average takes 3-4 months.
So the proposed solution of the draft law 7176 is more likely to not save from the loss of the supervisory board's ability to make decisions, but rather lead to it!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalyuk provides other arguments in support of it.
He specifically states: "many enterprises, including the defense-industrial complex (DIC), now require relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vinnitsa via Zoom".
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises with supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is a kind of "Ukroboronprom" which in essence manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the APC.
However, even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-paid basis.
All the power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions about the need to relocate any enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the corporation.
Furthermore, such an argument is not sustainable to criticism because Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be attributed to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first mention of the word 'war' in 2021 will leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself will really suffer from the war".
First of all, this is manipulation - most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
So to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is widely used in world practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also important to remember that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
Usually, such people have other occupations and the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interesting, why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they are not located at the location of their companies.
Incidentally, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary accommodation in a family. I have 2 children with me.

So, I understand what needs to be done.

In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavluk's direct words: "In the settlements of the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
Restrictions will be in effect in these cities and towns from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the oblastVA, it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot at this time.
Residents can only go out on the street during the alarm signal to take shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean and exchange territories.
Omelianyuk called on people who have left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the territory of Kyivshchyna, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
The school has not sent me anything yet, only a payment receipt.
Are you missing important information? If so, what type and kind?
We have prepared some dumplings for you to try. They need to be cooked for 7 minutes.

I will tell you honestly, I always left the person first, but then they asked for forgiveness, tried to restore the relationship.
But I didn't need that anymore, if I was disappointed in a person it was forever.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing in geometric progression for several years.
In total, over the last six years Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries have taken seriously the possibility of escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.
If you don't mind, I would come.
So we registered, but it's hard to live in a hostel here and it's not very convenient to sleep. I would like to go to the village.
We look forward to seeing you again next time.
Good day we have done the tests and the doctor will inform us about the results.

Lukashenko's regime forces arrested three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of the special forces of the "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured.
According to "Viasna", the men resisted actively and tried to escape when detained.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly suppressed by the security forces using weapons".
On April 6th it became known that on March 30th the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZHD" and an administrator of the "BZHD" themed resources in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for divergences.
Reminder: Formation BYpol, declared by Lukashenko as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on railway transport and infrastructure objects in Belarus as part of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "guerrilla fighters" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring, in order to fight, live forces and equipment to Ukraine.
This is for boosting self-esteem.

The cost of the repair will be paid by the owner = Mr. Dedina. He is supposed to come on Tuesday.
Be at home on Tuesday and wait for the repairmen.
Can I ask you for a cigarette?
Can we change your mobile tariff if you have time? Is it already too late?
The United States is prohibiting investments in Russia and imposing sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States together with G7 and the EU are introducing new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in the announcement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a full ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the resolution adopted by more than 600 multinational companies to exit Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House statement said.
The third step of the new US sanctions was the restrictions against major Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sector.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a full asset freeze of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of the Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the journey is closed and I will come to you.
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the machine?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived happily and never thought we would have to flee, for there is no strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will take us in for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it will be for free.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch I had one English lecture and after that I went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents there.
I hope she understood everything and will do it well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
This is free swimming.

I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I haven't written to the owner of the house.
I would like to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, please let me know.
I would gladly share a place with a decent girl.

We'll figure it out somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or we are not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do I need to take the clothes they gave me?
Today is not my day. The blinds broke in the living room. One in the morning. Now in the evening another.
Something from you came, I don't see what.
I'm also very sad.
I will remind you about the invoice later.
Does only your dad speak and understand Russian?
On which day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry for taking you away from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about my son - alive and well.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically researches the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna presented on the morning of April 12 a video recording that was sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military say they have no weapons left to fight with, and a mountain of wounded.
They said "the bill is going for hours".
Before that, on April 11th, the 36th separate marine infantry brigade, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
On social networks, there was skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, assured that the command of the defense forces in Mariupol is in contact and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletskyi, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the Azovstal plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be great.
The situation is the same, so for now we stay here.
2 hours of ride )) walks, mom to the stores and back)!
It's not an important matter.
She forgot what to do here.
A squadron of Czechüá®üáø drones has started flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy strongholdüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" to Ukraine were sent yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today their inter-village friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for the purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities, where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of drones - the places of their deployment will remain a secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, they say: in the coming days they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I like sweet things, but I can do without them.
I'm worried that we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I'm soon returning to Ukraine to work.
Okay. If everything is alright, I agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the presence of the elder in the village in Ivano, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing.
She might be delighted and her mood will lift.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm going to freeze on the street today too.
I took medicine and tea, I feel worse but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me some music that you like.
I'm curious what musical accomplishments you have üòä
Mom and Dad should be listened to.
You will find it somewhere near the stroller of your little brother.
It was cooler and rainy here today. It's supposed to be warm tomorrow.
But it's a pity for the destroyed houses, it's a pity for the people, over whom the occupiers are gloating.
In Kherson, the occupants desecrated the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, ripped off the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was lowered.
Good morning, thank you children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition so we didn't know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
There is someone to talk to in Czech, if needed.
Because I live kind of in a dormitoryThere will be twelve people here and then they will go to work.
Hello already a little better.
I was already at the fair today.
Even today it's already asleep there.
So we have already made great progress.
I will definitely bring varenyky for the others too!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
Since I am scheduling the days and times for the apartment cleaning after guests, I can roughly say for April month as I already have a rough schedule for apartment cleaning.
For the month of May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just wanted to ask if you have heard anything about it..
Hi, sorry I haven't replied for a while, I was preparing dinner and had a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come over today?)
or we can meet after your arrival)
He is modest here lately, studying a lot. He realized that this is very necessary for him in life.
Hi) everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people at such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with Ms. who is the director of the Department of Economics of the High Country.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved himself well in the lessons.
On Monday I have to bring proof of employment and cash payment for the services.
I'm flying away from Friday.
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking lots of water ‚òùüèª)
If I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if that's okay.
I have to deliver one more analysis.
so we won't have to go again
The drain pipe is working very badly, it is washing badly. A master is needed. It needs to be adjusted.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have signed up for.
Do children need to be accompanied and do you need to bring anything with you?
And now I have one question for you.
If you need any help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't really want you to collect money from the start so people don't think we're taking advantage of this!
But for online filling I was not enough two points:
I'm going to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
üòÑüòçwhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and tiles.
Refer only to official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine is also helping the army.
Gathered a few works for portfolio.
After the holidays they have to do an internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will I be credited for the day I was absent from work is a leave of absence.
Staff Summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Russian Federation Armed Forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state".
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Most likely, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of armaments and military equipment is carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the mentioned armaments will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to replenish the personnel losses of the battalions of the tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaikalsky Krai) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
The enemy is particularly facing a problem in staffing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of combat operations, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or withdrawal from service.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of separate districts of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area is being conducted on the Izium direction in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the opponent uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
The enemy tried to launch an attack in the directions of the settlements of Dovghenke and Dmytrivka with the forces of two battalions of tactical groups, but was unsuccessful and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to launch an assault in the Golden area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the sea port with the help of artillery and aviation.
Enemy forces carried out artillery shelling of Ukrainian troops' positions in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubovka and Maryanske.
In the territories of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of motor vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy in the past day.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We will try to make it on time, but I doubt it.
And you want to sleep but I will keep you.
Are you definitely not against me coming?
If you just don't feel like seeing each other today, just tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up :)
I'm turning on the TV here solely to listen to Czech language.
My tariff package for the month is ending today :)
Can we do this today over the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery.
I understand that I can prepare material in this field.
I will ask her. I'm a bit embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, so Google wrote something on its ownüèµÔ∏è. , I think the phone numbers are enough.
Good day, we took the things you brought, but there are some things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If the director agrees, then I can start working from next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because the queues are very long) and on Saturday it will rain :)
I am looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I am studying Czech language to fully know, I dream of working in Prague.
Friends old and not so old, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which was already never easy, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
For what Ukraine is suffering in your name.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
I'll tell you in a bit, - Sasha replied as usual, concisely. - Now after the search we are going through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of villains and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you - those who worked in "Memorial", in "Novaya Gazeta", in "Echo of Moscow", in "Meduza", in Navalny's organization and in a few other places - how many of you did something to oppose this regime?
Besides participating in the rallies when they still took place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they were provoked by your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive participation, which now, surely, have become a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like this.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even crooked, but real.
1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are ultimately overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek refuge behind the back of a king, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he has killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and exposing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you devoted your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the plunder.
In 1998 your economy collapsed, marking the end of the mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern became survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you all either voted for it or gave preference to not voting at all.
When he started to equate Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and I tried to tell you about the horrors I had witnessed: of the tortures of innocent civilians, of the murdered children, of the soldiers who sold the bodies of the fallen to their families.
You said to me: "Enough, we are already tired of your Chechnya". I remember these words very well.
In response I said: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, take it away, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens".
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to earn well, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest of you have bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices are rising, is that so bad?
Moscow sparkled and glittered with splendor.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shekochykhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev and himself took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or remained silent about it.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we probably didn't do much on the West, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a few sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is loudly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the tough 1990s, this was the most important.
Nevertheless, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you finally woke up.
When Putin once again swapped places with Medvedev and occupied the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much and you went out to protest en masse.
The name of Navalny became a symbol, you did not go out of the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
He then struck back in response.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were left behind bars.
Someone got huge terms.
"What could we have done?"
I have heard this so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the Russian president who mocked their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan - and never left it.
They built a makeshift village entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, bars and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to choose their leaders and remove them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
So, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Someone of you was against it, however there was little benefit from it.
How many of you were captivated!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth arose, and many of you who had been mocking Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and started to adore him.
I find it hard to find a reason, since we stopped talking right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends, mostly kept silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were new to books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, all new after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their benches, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You have twice paid attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists, right?
IDIL or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then, because I knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how the state snipers in Homs cold-bloodedly shoot at my children teenagers on the streets.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of innocent civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense.
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Have any of you done this?
But the majority remained silent.
Someone really speaks now - like, for example, Dmytro Hlukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maxim Osypov and others.
Most can speak out from abroad, some - from within the country, like Marina Ovsiannikova, risking to end up in a new GULAG or to join Navalny's company.
As for the others, you best know in which country you live.
So, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, what seems very likely, if he fails - he will turn to you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and are still serving a minor term, but soon will get a more serious one.
To the thousand of you who signed petitions, who expressed dissent on social media (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given for a joke are not so far in the past - and now, with a high probability, they await you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - encourages the Putin regime: they show that it can be fought.
And what reason, motivation and courage can stop him, however overwhelming his advantage may be on paper.
All in all, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is still going on.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You understand where this is all going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a sham, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media are gone, your economy is crumbling faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket on a plane abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to negotiate or you will be disappointed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one left.
Who finally will overthrow this regime.
And, possibly, in the current conditions, you will need less from you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is engulfing Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices drop and salaries are not paid, those people who have voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is you, my friends.
But if each city will come out to the rallies on its own, as it has already been done periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which mode can be limited, but which still works and which can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was crushed, but others can be created, more informal, more decentralized.
There are many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly up to a hundred thousand.
If it comes out to be more than 300 thousand, she will be amazed.
It will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all he had put them through in Ukraine, all that he had made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared too if I were you.
With the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disobey their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we can come on Monday.
We'll be home by evening.
Do you take me as a press secretary
How often do you go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain it to her)
We liked it very much and we wanted something closer so this is the best option.
I was in a room where there were many people. I felt tired energetically.
I feel bad, coughing, fever, lost voice, weakness and dizziness.
I have to go to that job.
We have already done it, but said that those who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass for four, we are going to the doctor with the children.
But at night I got a letter from a lady who liked your work and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for news from her and I will definitely let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office I thought I was building a career, spent a lot of time and effort.
