The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-three-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon make his way into the goal.
Former Litvinov, Plzen, and Russian Chelyabinsk goaltender was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was substituted at exactly the halfway point of the game against Vegas and has not been seen on NHL ice since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body," the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal lasted more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called up from the farm, where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of the saves.
A graduate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season, he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season, he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille for Christmas wishes, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photograph of him helping his wife Camilla put on a face mask at a horse race.
The British news station BBC informed about this on their website.
Wishing friends, colleagues, and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte has a dress too.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not state who took the photograph, and it is not clear when it was taken exactly.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph to be used as a Christmas card in front of a bale of straw and a pile of wood at their rural estate in Norfolk County.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also released a picture to serve as a Christmas greeting.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a face mask, helps Camille put on her face mask that matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - In the current corruption case, investigators reportedly worked with the allegation that the accused former deputy chairman of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
efotbal.cz reported that they had access to parts of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of the Vršovice Club, stated that the Red and Whites had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which former Slavia sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
A former influential official of the Red and Whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and former sports director of then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Police reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police had the knowledge that Roman Berbr was promised a one million dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the criminalists, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdíkem.
It does not further appear from the record whether the police are still pursuing this information.
He denied any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the status quo in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
"We have never committed any illegal acts, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and provided no financial remuneration to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously insults some former Slavia players of dark complexion and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
Last October, a police raid at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, sparked an investigation into alleged match-fixing through referees.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are LARPing Cold War weapons.
The guns will be new, but of a generally inferior type (gunners must leave the armored cab and carry shells by hand without protection).
Toyota Hi-Lux cars are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: Combat- decent, but at the end of its lease, Transport- too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - Few and Only Small Types Without Combat Potential
Rockets - We don't have any (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: Medium-Cold War, outdated; Short Range - Good, Modern, Relatively Good Number.
I have such a story.
I have a honitbu right next to the city.
I went there to sit once because nutrias were climbing out of the river and causing damage to crops.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped she would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went away soon.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost soiled himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That means the man in the meadow can be a nuisance.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on thermal vision, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So put your expensive things in a visible place near your feet in your backpack and you should be good.
Vojtěch vs. Hamáček.
The Interior Department acquired respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in the past weeks for their acquisition.
Server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for a respirator differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities acted frugally?
Why were others buying more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't have large stockpiles of technology that recruits can be trained on, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is becoming increasingly complex, so the skills of reserves will be rapidly diminishing over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and it is also an explicit necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, fighting will only be possible in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
We mainly don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you look like a fool who two minutes ago couldn't hit an empty goal, charging into attack alone against two or even three Swiss players and you think to yourself, "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take it from the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to create a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker was able to dribble past one of the opponent's players.
First Signs of Spring
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however experts do not expect any major changes in the following weeks.
The strain on hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time yet and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness helps against it.
This week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the COVID equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, molnupiravir antiviral, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
Pfizer's Paxlovid drug should soon be added to the list, with reported success rates of up to 85 percent from current results.
The first deliveries of cloud vaccines to the Czech Republic have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As was said, Merck's Molnupiravir will be the first to be made available to domestic patients.
The company ended up on the tape as the first one, because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic, with the aim of finding an appropriate treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
These research studies often overlook the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak grew".
Do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
Then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing their job and facing a media lynching.
It looks good in the polls, West good, East bad.
But really find out what people think.
Only in France do Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% in the polls.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
All objects are exactly the same so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is when units rotate.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory for either security or speed of deployment reasons due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads were kept, not the entire rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive to pick up the head and mount it on some kind of carrier device.
Besides that museum maple, the rest are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate who was a Gypsy, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often over-expressed himself, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips in nature, did all sorts of silly things, but was always okay, never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Roma, enrolled in the same grade but different classes.
Shortly after, they beat the teacher, the police were often called to deal with it, they threatened and intimidated other students..
I occasionally sell something on an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any tricks on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me a month later saying he had already transferred it to himself.
I tell myself that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as is expected in polite society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, evicts people from their homes and apartments, leaves only chaos around them, causes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, but I will be bothered.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate into our society, start businesses, work, learn a language (not necessarily, but at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it is of no concern to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
"A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons veered off into the opposite direction in a bend.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, according to South Bohemian police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of a Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and remained trapped in the vehicle.
After being freed, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czech Budweis hospital in a stable condition, stated rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan where shipping is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive, as VAT must now be added and customs information must be provided to the post office.
He will receive an email notification that customs are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the shipment details, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, it will be calculated by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the shipping.
If the recipient does not arrange customs clearance themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I will check one or two checkboxes, attach two attachments, and I'm done.
It's usually a five-minute question for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, there is also a problem that people are not responding to requests for the data needed to complete the customs process.
Currently, there are 30,000 packages at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did so in a timely manner, we would be roughly halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to Inflation
How would you suggest a solution to the current inflation, as indicated by the title?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think should be done to slow or offset this growth?
Is this the way forward for you with the reduction of VAT on food and PHM that we see in Poland, for example?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much were you given as a bonus (if you are an employee)?
I was given a 2% raise in gross salary this year, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Could someone explain to me why convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for as little as 6 months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can a court only sentence such an animal to 6 months behind bars just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma their victim will have for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Will this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The Man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The Man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had summoned her himself.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
First, he approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
When the police were called to the emergency line, they arrived at the scene and were astonished when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the police would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the guards on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
Upon checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, I obviously agree with you, it's a shame that Churchill wasn't able to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
I certainly do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe something without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are approximately ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say it is quite likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
For even in the Ten Commandments it is written that there is no other god but Jehovah.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from belief in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands and having the one true god, which I didn't pick, send me to hell or some other such place?
Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model is supposedly similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If one conducts oneself well, they can get a professional offer.
Something like this would be useful for all branches of the Czech Armed Forces.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can talk about this: There is a constant discussion about collaboration between the educational sector and industry, companies are fishing in schools and there is some kind of overlap, where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Interoperability should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German, or even Mongol invader will ever enter here again.
It's funny to me how you consider NATO to be set in stone, we have allies and they will thus defend us if something goes wrong.
Do not please the Lord.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that if we turn our backs on them, they will take what they want.
The only thing that has consistently worked as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed military and a population that can operate the military technology of their time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications anymore, that's obsolete now, but a tech-savvy teenager behind the remote control device can handle it.
How to Not Drown in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home buried in boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that are lacking packaging materials.
A map of stores that will accept your used boxes was created.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it is a waste to treat them as single-use waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the connected store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overfilled blue bins.
Retailers welcome the current shortage of packaging on the market and the savings from it, as the cost of cardboard packaging has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Individuals bring boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno when they accumulate at home, but we also have regular pickups arranged with companies for their discarded cardboard boxes.
We will use everything for packing orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more mindful world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application not only shows collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from households, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The project map now contains over 100,000 such locations.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems wrong to me that in this day and age, technology is so simple and user-friendly that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because applications like Google Photos or Apple Photos, or even mobile phones in general, hide the underlying file system with folders and just put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Let's Rewrite History, Seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of France's EU Presidency - starting in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in half a year.
French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and left, agree on little, but on Europe they do.
There will be new elections for the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize that Macron's aim was pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a bit of success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
If they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The Movie of the Year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story that returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 also won awards for directing and for Best Actress Jasna Duričičovou.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, he held the top spots in the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins was named Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival for his role in the movie The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being under the weather". I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
It was worse than a regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Based on my personal experience. I do not claim that this is true for everyone.)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20th, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
Cultural tips will also be released with it.
We are attaching additional books to this digital edition for our subscribers, so that you have enough time to purchase books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another helping of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A Tale of a Return to Roots That Turns Out to Be Just a Desired Illusion.
A Bohemian and Comparative Studies scholar retells the story of Little Red Riding Hood in the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Her rendition of brutality surpasses folk versions and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.
The idea that the path back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of a return from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains will start running according to the new timetable, with some changes in operators in some places.
Trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, possibly with a slight change in route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Transportation companies began selling tickets during the fall.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, including an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
Trains in addition to domestic connections within the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
The transport company will dispatch more new trains in Northern Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry into the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk, and Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here following their success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily connections, eight in each direction, on the route.
Starting Sunday, there will be additional changes to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain similar travel times for its long-distance trains despite the planned works.
Train operations of Arriva and other carriers should continue with little changes.
Carriers will be changed in some regional lines as well.
Passengers travelling on the route from Mladá Boleslav to Česká Lípa and Rumburk will experience changes, as Trilex trains operated by the German company Die Länderbahn will replace Czech Railways trains.
Passengers will be able to use a unified fare for the railway for the second year as well.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Are we not learning to see things from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, died.
I have never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave side or from that time, nobody is defending this, just condemning it.
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Native Americans, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they had been slaughtering each other for a long time.
I spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't personally encountered anyone deliberately omitting facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, which I don't deny (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from a modern perspective, without understanding.
History does not care about someone's feelings, it is what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
We should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when it comes to the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Furthermore, the North was not much better than it is idealized by many people nowadays.
A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
When I imagine these people being much older one day, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is present among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become more radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism are labeled as feminists and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in the end, I have never encountered anyone who condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I've mostly encountered bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it's interests, perspectives, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak pastor is a really nice guy, his sermons are usually more about theology than politics, but then he always throws in some nonsense about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Then there is of course the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestant, but in reality they were born from Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a Pope.
I know many people who are Catholic but attend services at Hussite churches because it is theologically similar but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there they hold a Mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Flame has arrived in the Czech Republic, Scouts have taken it over from Austria.
The Bethlehem Candle, lit in Bethlehem where Jesus Christ is said to have been born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not travel to Vienna due to the coronavirus pandemic, but they still received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it over at the border last year too.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, though, scouts take the train to Vienna for it.
Nothing changes in the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scouts couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, travelling by selected express and local trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations and then spread the flame further across the Czech Republic, even to places where the railway does not reach.
This year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's running similarly to last year.
We recommend that both courier teams and organizers of local events wear masks, maintain social distancing, keep the number of people as low as possible, refrain from singing together, and generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
Bethlehem's Light is a symbol of hope and light overcoming darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been responsible for its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is thus also a symbol of selflessness and human mutuality.

I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The money will be put to good use in the development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education, but I don't understand why it is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - producing an unnecessary product is disrupting the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million posters on the walls saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs to x people, this is a hindrance to development where this company is barely holding on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Complete agreement, it's awful.
Even someone born in the internet age can sometimes get caught in some trick or trap - especially ads.
I think to myself that internet ads won't affect me, but then I still get caught out that they have influenced me - it's just so sophisticated now that you can't always protect yourself from it.
Therefore, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I feel that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I can claim is critical thinking."
"I won't believe everything the media says"
"I don't trust politicians"
TVs have embraced the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles – Over 200 Christmas movies will be premiered by television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries this year, setting a new record.
The operator of the IMDb movie database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring points with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb database only included movies with the word "Christmas" in their title in its count, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated mainly with fairy tales, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also associated with it.
The real boom of Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC reminded.
Her advent project titled "Countdown to Christmas" included four movies and was very successful.
This station began tuning its viewers in for Christmas as early as October 22nd this year and will feature a total of 42 Christmas movies.
This year, Lifetime's competitive lineup features 35 new Christmas-themed movies, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter so much, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, jokingly described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a bit of peace for two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
There are two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about halfway through that is resolved successfully and the two of them kiss.
"It's always the same, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other," Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final Formula 1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the last race of the season.
Haas Racing Team will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming to improve on his 20th place finish in qualifying.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher starting from the last position and Max Verstappen from the first, as they battle it out for the title against Lewis Hamilton.
According to Haas team statements, Mazepin is relatively okay and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically well because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives said to formula1.com.
Haas cannot and will not send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in half a year of work and all of their savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, as sweaters were never really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours over the course of six months on his work.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarovski.
He then adorned the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater a softness," praises the creator of the work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" 720,000 crowns.

If it stops working, we will stop having that money.

You can argue that the money from those grants could be used better, but that's a whole different discussion.

Is the Omikron Mutation Spreading in Southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
We currently have another reported suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's, from the preparatory class.
No contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been established," said Ciupek.
Six cases have appeared in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the strain in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that there were two nurses from the same workplace at the Faculty Hospital in Brno, two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of the listed have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone who has been abroad.
None of the listed individuals have any connection to the water polo championship, said Ciupek.
The Chief Hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player who fell ill upon returning.
California will limit the sale of firearms.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to implement a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People should be entitled to compensation if they sue anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons or homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday statement of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, despite it going against the nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide roughly up to the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court was not ruling on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was thus shifted to the public, which prevented Texas Republicans from attacking it through the usual legal route.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of Texas' ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are the terms used to refer to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the Governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has been banning the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other US states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue certain officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where the vaccination scheme is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies on the effects of four doses are already rolling in from Israel in large numbers.
According to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, it's just too early for that right now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to come to the market according to the manufacturer's specifications, promising up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland threatened to stop payments into the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of the law if it used its new powers and suspended payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The European Parliament is putting pressure on it to move forward and use a mechanism that allows for the removal of EU funding from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, leader of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, said the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on access to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, rather than the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept any concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
Trying to make sense of it... At our local Lidl store, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I hadn't looked at the other things, I had seen yogurt multiple times too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's for sure, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free zone...
If I have to, I won't even go to the market anymore, sale or no sale, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.
Go to Lidl to take a vacation.
I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is handled here like manure, most anti-vaccinationists are just a little more off the mark than most vaccinationists.

They punished me with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just because I kept refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after being "caught" again she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few spanks on the bottom (over clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
It is important to me that the part with the warning is emphasized, because it gives the child a choice to either disobey and receive a punishment, or to improve their behavior and avoid the punishment.
In the end, a warning was usually enough for me to start listening.

When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swears and is taught from an early age in school, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the institute on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be careful with changes.
Imagine this: some nations actually like their rules.
Just like Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs changes has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
It has been tested in situations its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have predicted, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents indicates that political interventions into their texts must be thought out.
It is necessary to understand and actively defend the institution, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are imposing restrictions through policies.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at FN Brno a few months old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with more recently.
"We know that children are less affected and endangered than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
There are however pediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia that requires a stay in an intensive care bed," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
In hospitals, there are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus.
"Currently, we have children of several months old to adolescent age in our care," said the head physician.
He is however glad that no child deaths due to the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist's collaboration is an integral part of the children's hospital - not just the coronavirus ward.
It also highlights the fact that, like adults, vaccination in children reduces the severity of the disease and also reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose application for children as well," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked paths.
But the calm zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on a tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside of the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the paddock).
Skiing/biking in the forest off marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How Does a Conductor Exercise?
Music is playing in my head, laughing is Josef Kurfiřt.
He was weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
Collaborates with the Hradec Kralove Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonos Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that its authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having the outbreak under control and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to contain the virus that has since become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because the robot mows the lawn, washes the car, and the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want, I can sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it'll be great...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: What the heck did you sell me for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant piles of poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who is selling says: "You can't sell the elephant if you talk about it like that!"
World events are controlled by powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is upheld, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
This currently works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
I personally believe that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
Maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will be successful.
It occurred to me too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be wordy.
I'm just assuming that an ellipsis usually encompasses two different units at the same level.
I will use an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Additionally, I base this on the phrase "all American forces" including their weapons and knowing that American complexes are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for the US forces.
But again, I'm just word-smithing :D
Whether it is this way or that way, it is an unreasonable request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a capuchin monkey named Milly.
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowers in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
The Dutch monkey was also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates' Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, according to The Sun newspaper.
The experts in primate rehabilitation who are taking care of Milly after her abuse stated that they have never seen a macaque so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and now happily plays with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was sentenced to twelve weeks' imprisonment with a one-year suspended sentence.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing okay, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would cower and hide from anyone she encountered and any loud sound or sudden movement would cause her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she has settled in and is content with her mate, her view of new people can still evoke panic in her.
The psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, Sawyer adds.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone during a raid on her flat in connection with a drug offence.
In the footage, one can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts will you learn from the Paleolithic era if you bravely skip over the entire 20th century?
Are you taking the same things in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
The whole thing kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Write the test first and then nobody will care about it anymore.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even bat an eye and tell you they don't give a damn.
What the hell are we learning this for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need it.
At that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It is partially learned for the multitude of people who will need it.
I really meant it when I said you don't need all this stuff standing at the machine... ...because you really don't need it.
We are slowly entering an era where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
However, the price of having barbarians standing at our machines is simply too high, probably due to our communist past and the persecution of educated elites.
If journalists knew how to count, then the coronavirus probably would never have reached these proportions.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
This is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Tension between Kadri and Andreou had been building since the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She firmly refused it.
As it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
Kadri immediately became enraged in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts, exclaiming "It was a planned attack by you!"
Kadri's alleged honesty did not please his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda now.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I usually don't comment on these kinds of things and we never really talked about them much in my family.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
When I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I care so much about, it just doesn't sit right with me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone could know Kadri like I, our close ones and family do, standing in testimony in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything he has done!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Chao began his robbery spree in the parking lot of a residential area, attempting to break into several cars.
According to available information, a total of approximately 330 Czech crowns were eventually stolen from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through the open window.
He stole two bananas there.
On the footage from one security camera, it is then captured how he leaves the scene of the crime and eats a banana while walking away.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they had been and he called the police.
She then held Cchaa back.
The man admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the incriminating day.
Because he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to a state of pandemic preparedness.
When it is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law restricts the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections for the councils of four municipalities.
People in the new councils voted on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovné in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
A total of 28 mandates were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held in it, said Deputy Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna in Uherskohradiště, the Saturday elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, 18.52 percent of voters gave them their vote.
Jana Křižková, the current mayor of the municipality, was re-elected to the council again, and she is a member of the Privateers.
The Komňané – Independent Candidates achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
The Pro Rovnou coalition won in the town of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were still elected to the general council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The Obec pro lid party, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, finished second and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
Independent candidates from the Hope for New Village party won the elections in Nová Ves, Liberec region, ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88% of voters cast their ballots for the association of independent candidates, resulting in them obtaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all of this that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I do not assert that Christians are degenerates, nor anything of the sort.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was, after all, the goal, to look good).
I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it hoarded, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but state and church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
On Sunday night, an incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava, for whom the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees at the county's operations center received an emergency call at one o'clock in the morning with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two emergency medical teams from the Fire and Rescue Service immediately arrived on the scene.
Upon arriving at the scene, medical personnel discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window approximately twelve meters high and landed head-first on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
Upon the arrival of the emergency services teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, secured artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava Trauma Center for further care, according to Lukáš Humpl, spokesperson for the ZZS MS region.
I have greater concerns than the coronavirus from the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is mainly doctors and healthcare personnel who are in the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking Military Doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes Falls After Seven Years, Oliveira Defends Belt
MMA experienced an amazing gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňa was able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight fight between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
An American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel also followed the paper predictions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
Penny, however, was not forced into any further mistake and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm unsuccessfully.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents exchanged a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Nunes's extra money fell to the ground, where it began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and back away.
An American woman gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to overpower his opponent with an arm-wrestling move.
He didn't have much success at first, but then he created a lot of pressure, pushed his opponent back and bombarded him with a series of strikes.
He won the second round because of that.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out due to the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In his next match, Sean O'Malley secured a commanding victory, landing a hard right rear in the first round on Rauliano Paiva.
He then charged him with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
Seven years after celebrating another triumph with her young daughter, Nunes has now lost.
Is this the scapula or that scapula?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most Czech nouns express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of proper nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When conjugating, they take on two endings and in some cases remain in the infinitive form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the first one they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", in the second one according to the pattern "píseň".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, such as "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly with other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have been adopted into Czech from other languages were originally not inflected, but gradually they are taking on Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remains in the neuter gender, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like at the Greek borders?
Tension is rising at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to move further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them from doing so.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What is it that motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We hadn't seen a blue sky in three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating bushfires that Australia has been facing for the past four months have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will countries need to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with journalist Sydney Ikou Detrichovou.
False accusations have always been and remain quite rare.
Everyone always writes about everything everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to address how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
A lot of people still keep it to themselves.
There are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
Many people have been put in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the resources to finish the unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish already partially constructed family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses within a year and it has been done for fifty percent.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to adhere to certain things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it without a profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will soon have financial problems.
If they had counted on the construction of the house costing five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will be waiting," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment have seen the biggest price increases in materials.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
Real vision is missing, says a commentator for Czech Radio - mujRozhlas.
New Year's celebrations have traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians in addition to the usual festivities.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the nation was addressed by the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What have we learned that is essential?
I think doing my master's thesis like this is great, I have my own topic that I chose, I'm building on my bachelor's thesis, I'm always working on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are quite easy here, if you're not a complete fool and you've retained something in your head, the commission won't unnecessarily suffocate you with theory.
I would study for a week for my state exams and when I was at my wit's end, the committee would always try to guide me towards some logical deduction which I would immediately understand and have the answer right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then just learn the project and they're set.
In my opinion, it's great when the end of the subject is a test that incorporates the knowledge gained from the project, rather than just a defense.
Everything is okay but don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be just as much of a jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
If they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something bad could happen to them.
You can also put a similar statue of Putin next to the Teddy Bear Pú statue.
Maybe we should give it to her so that it reaches Xi Jinping's back or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta throws obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
Additionally, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
Lately it's been really annoying me, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
In the end, I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Working Party of Donbase
Union - yes, Disintegration - no, opponents of the disintegration of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open indulgent attitude, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
The same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built over the previous seventy years in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics that were previously economically connected in a single mechanism from the world's largest power.
If we look even deeper, we see population impoverishment, economic, scientific, and military disintegration, an increase in criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was rushed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket does not necessarily correspond directly to its quality and value.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK per kilogram.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into a dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the store discounts it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you describe the mechanism by which this change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Should I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 Kč/kg one day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself with nothing.
These talks about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are really retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and the girls in the underpass were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help out the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it was some kind of propaganda.
After doing some research, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was like a good old-fashioned sermon, full of completely unnecessary advice, like washing myself and not being naughty.
Save paper, so that forests don't have to be cut down for this.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you care about them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me multiple times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
When I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another half year passed and it started to go downhill.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her, but that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will suck out your emotions, feelings, and joy overall.
Keep your distance.
When insurance companies are recklessly buying up cloud tests and rushing to find positives who would not have known about the terrible disease without the test.
All we are achieving is complicating matters for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees receiving five days of home confinement in the random number generator.
In the West, they have stopped with the nonsense and acknowledged that it is not worth trying to solve a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing some nonsense.
Looks like the old scoundrel is back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first earned money came, one quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a certain number of products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots and pans.
What I can say though is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every deal and to thoroughly check the information.
I wouldn't lump everyone together in the same basket.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't experienced many of these things in the corporation where I work.
HR is hands-off, managers are managing and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form that it is done here it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, look at what worked and what didn't after a year) - it is more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you based on numbers and similar.
Company events are also optional.
We are also somewhat unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're almost a startup, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
It works like that so they don't bother us too much, as long as the results are good.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the outgoing Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
Kulhánek expressed sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28th in a bus on her way home from work, she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police in this context had already arrested a man several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but not disclosed.
At the end of the year, four municipalities elected new councils.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
36 women and 63 men competed for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils were held in it, and most notably the highly anticipated elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to mostly work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which posed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49 hours.
On Monday, the voting results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, upon approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
Dealing with how stupidly the majority of the population at all its levels approaches it, I still have a problem with that.
I'm most excited for my vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the capacity to regain it.
The chances that this will actually happen are, as others have mentioned here, very slim.
Additionally, I'm not sure if the shredding of the file could be considered a betrayal.
A coup d'état is an act by which the president of a republic endangers its sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Has Affected Intimate Life: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Have Gone a Year Without Sex
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
This mainly applies to religiously-minded people, according to the DailyMail website.
A survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from 8 to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, or video games could also have contributed, making sex a lower and lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent; in 2021 only 5% of them reported being without sex in the last year.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although there is a higher probability that married couples will be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, with about 30% thinking it is wrong while around 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among free individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among free people aged 35 and under who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
"The trend among the less-believers rose from 10 to 20%,” said Stone.
Other factors such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic also contribute to the decrease in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which likely reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, replacing this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole debate about vaccinating against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, of which the question of social conscience interests me the most personally.
For example, the question of whether if we don't order it for them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be held responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccination advocate who was here shouting alongside the SPD and the Communist Party about bullying and totalitarian states.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated seniors probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather can even complicate the preparation of the Jizerská Padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will low snowfall mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it doesn't involve a theist.
Our teacher once took us on a field trip across the city to the boat dock so we could go boating on the river.
On our way there, we went down this quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
They descended upon us, of course.
I luckily escaped, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed the whole way to the boatyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič.
On Sunday, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Chancellor Merkel has suggested that the crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including those of the "Normandy Group" which consists of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Prime Minister Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about further sanctions in order to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured the DPA agency that Warsaw has the support of Germany in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to hide it.
The car eventually returned to the scene of the accident, but it was now being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to yield and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had hit another nun who had asked her for help with the vehicle.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and, after finding that she had over two parts per thousand of alcohol in her blood, immediately revoked her driver's license.
They simultaneously informed her that she would be held accountable for her actions in court.
Hugo is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič did not guard his film.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about canine companions.
They forgot one essential thing in the process: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy movie F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie Tady Hlídáme My is now competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund returns to the scene, along with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a Bavarian pension that is struggling, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
Director and partner Beatriz Shajmovich (who is also the producer of the film) had already been struggling with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least that one entertained children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which elicits a mix of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize this.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to superstitious beliefs in her desire for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing against Nature's cleansing treatments and the power of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at how much of a convoluted plot full of unbelievable situations and characters was necessary to convey this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog show competition, a Bavarian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which crazy family of course gets drunk in the pension.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma and immediately sits curled and made up with a cigar at the family table demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
The creators will also explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shajmovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct supporting situations, a sense for the characters and the point of the story, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is haphazard, and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomek and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog puns, let alone more popular vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
Membership in the Dachshund Club for many years is not an argument - as in the case of the producer lady.
To promote good intentions of nature and friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft in order to tell a believable story.
This did not succeed in this case.
There is too much eroticism and too little sentiment for a good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for canine therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is seen how you don't understand it at all, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to those kinds of people all the time, you might have changed your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The near complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The two days of rain this week were more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
Wasim Aškar, a resident of Nazareth, was also delighted with the right Christmas backdrop.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water reserves and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
The level has been decreasing since then.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It is expected that due to global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, there is an increasing number of tankers.
Water supplies and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces broke out in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has just experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the Vienna talks did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up their pressure on Iran, but also informing Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not made "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning and doubting the girl for a while and eventually thanked her and left.
Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened due to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski tow operators are not complaining about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out for running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather today, offering sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased, that opening weekend really worked out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještěd Sports Area Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing of the new season.
Ski Aréna Karlov and the resort in Branné in Šumperk were among those that were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, did not spare praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period of recovery from COVID-19.
With the exception of those who are not prepared and do not have the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told CTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower demand than before the pandemic.
There is fortunately interest in renting skis.
"It's not like it used to be, but there are still plenty of customers," said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
Higher demand is expected during the ski course period.
David Šinták, also a director of the Královéhradecká company Snowbear, feels that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
Before the pandemic, we were almost rented out by this time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
People have become lazy and learned to stay at home according to him because of the pandemic.
The rental service in the Novako area of Boží Dar has seen a high demand.
They started renting out skis there a week ago and now interested people have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the area operator.
Interest comparable to the pre-epidemic period is also for a ski school, according to her.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they would abroad.
Socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor, certainly does not belong to this.
Smart and capable people are leaving the country with no property here.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad so easily.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not stay in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is whether elections are even necessary.
If life here is going to be bad, then some traditional V4 crazy person can win here too.
Young and educated people will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose wealth cannot fit in an airplane.
Scary Photo!
Langmajer in the Blood due to a Bet on Beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the cast and crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), were enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it just makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Peta's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, in a video on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
A missing Czech woman reportedly left work and headed home to the Camberwell area around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help to find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Member of Parliament Harriet Harman has also called on the public to cooperate in the case of Ms. Srncova, which she highlighted during a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, and her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try and find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare," Harman said.
Police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
This is not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get fed up with our involvement.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would be in line with that "focus" on the borders.
Agreements must be kept...
New timetables for suburban connections will take effect in Prague on Sunday.
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the system.
Fast trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station in the capital city from Sunday.
On the suburban railway, S7 trains will depart, which will pass through Prague Main Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The newly opened station Praha-Zahradní Město will now be a stop for the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded into other areas.
In addition, buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new lines will be introduced, and 12 existing lines will have their operations adjusted during the integration.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague Zličín and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka was also created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
The connections from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened during morning rush hour and on weekends, with a new express line number 404.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region have now been included in the PID system.
Trains depart from Střížkov Metro Station, not from Nádraží Holešovice Station.
The 400 line runs through Mělník, Dubou, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 Supplementary Line runs from Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonného v Podještědí.
Conversely, service on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague-Beroun, Prague-Lysá nad Labem, and the Kolín area routes.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the discontinued railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections to Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy Snack/Lunch from Supermarket to Office
Hi, I'm doing the usual 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy's or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no physical activity, I don't have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietetically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, so I usually just buy pizza slices for lunch and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that is the case.
These are not trees that you must necessarily see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I won't say that it's the only reason why they forbid us to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Acknowledgement of Gif's Relationship with Nedved: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing else since Friday than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
She has now sent an extensive message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love from them for half a year.
"I would dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not heard that Dara caught a bear, excuse me, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He is said to have packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they do not take joy in it.
Here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would eventually come, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or partner are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone should know a detailed list of your ex-partners and be aware of a list of your mistakes and errors.
That's the one you want, right, Dara?
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was going for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been working there for a long time as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife had been separated for three years, legally they are not married but it has only been three weeks.
We thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found apartments together, which I think is the best option because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří quarter is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is nice, besides it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know which one you are enrolling in exactly).
I've never looked for a rental before, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly help with advice about Brno itself if you need any more information :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually okay that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves or they follow the state curriculum and have the state pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of the education system just because they add a few extra coins to the full state contribution and will be able to teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a claim loses some of its weight when it is written by someone who two days before had expressed themselves in favor of a petition to boycott a totalitarian state.
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue being put up in a town square?
I would consult directly with the person who assigned you this work if I were you.
Otherwise, I have experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either guess it or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
Truth be told, in this case it is quite readable, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
I would personally handle this in a footnote depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
It looks like you are drawing from some book, so I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that matches what is physically on the coin.
Is it not rather the Odrysian Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone has already solved it here.
Look at the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what will be the "topic" of our presidency.
That's a much bigger problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing non-standard relationships.
Additionally, it's quite interesting with the English language after the UK's departure from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I have been working there for three years and it's going great.
I drive from work at 10pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has never been there can say that it is a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is loiter on the sidewalk and park where they're not supposed to :D I definitely don't feel scared to go out on the streets at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable housing with good access to the city center, I'd go for it.
There are now newly renovated or newly built apartments there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or Gelemová's lover, like a stick in a fence!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath, and Lucy definitely has one too, said Blesk saxophonist, confirming Patrasova's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
The robin still doesn't know where it will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix, and both of their grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
We still talked to each other, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts gradually and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucy, maybe perfume.
"I'm a gentleman," Felix said, who had come on his own to the music video launch party at Richman club.
I am here alone, but I don't feel alone.
Slováček always finds someone to have a good conversation with, he was glad to meet his wife Luděk Sobota's Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
Are we the Island so that we can afford to not have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will come to our defense and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, can you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other resource that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
The fact that our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite a while.
Record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic.
The agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the country should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
Scientists have reported a decrease in water in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and even places that have not previously experienced water shortages have seen a decrease in rainfall.
The cause of the drought that is prevailing in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are also exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What should I prepare for in relation to drought?
How can we help nature in these difficult times?
Well, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I don't know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager are also a bit of a joke.
Whether you are the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But either way, listening to Czech commentators pointing out what the referees are paying attention to or not, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the same with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
If it were the other way around, it would be like it always is, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
The number of coronavirus infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, with another 74.
There have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been recorded.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Safety Office, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omikron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
On Sunday, British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December last year, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually", via computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
Despite the strict lockdown imposed in London during December last year, which banned Christmas parties, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, Editor of ITV Commercial Television for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is speaking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Amazing how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn the tables and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be choices of European-wide significance.
How much can we expect fairness to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral boundaries to their advantage, and does other small and large tricks.
The latest one sounds like everyone can choose in practice where they want to.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if they would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big shock for Viktor Orban and his party.
Will they strive to maintain power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, where he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the hints of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I was also very choleric and I used to get so angry when I was little that I would lie on the ground in a spasm and turn blue, so they had to take me to the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they would scold me as a form of discipline, other times it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, like when I was little I used to fight a lot, now I just punch something to let out my anger and when I was younger I would maybe slap my parents' hand so I wouldn't get a spanking, so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not sure to what extent this is due to my explosiveness, but certainly my upbringing has had a part in it too.
I'm afraid I'm going to start losing patience with my kids and dealing with it the same way.
I think it's wrong to hit children and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not in that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes up something, so it's probably impossible not to spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would thus call those who create laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I was wondering if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product so that you will have enough to pay off the mortgage?

Where is Slovakia in the process of prosecuting the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins for the four defendants accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She sparked civil society, but also uncovered the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia as a major breakthrough?
The journalists are to blame for this huge mess.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage facilities nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government after years of delays by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local authorities are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers over storage, as promised to mayors since 2011 when work on this legislation began, as required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in collaboration with municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the selection of the location for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective only when communities or the public can influence whether the process will proceed in a given location.
This can be ensured by requiring the Storage Management to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The presented draft of the substantive plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the authorization proceedings.
The design lacks a system setting for compensations for municipalities for the entire process of site selection, permitting, and operation of the storage facility.
Representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a storage facility under current legal standards.
Only in certain authorization proceedings can individuals submit their comments or appeals, however the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorization.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-determination of local authorities that Platforma is requesting is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already progressed in permitting repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was entered into by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work is to be almost 4 million crowns according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of the Cejle municipality from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Storage, said: After the Industry Ministers, who only pushed off the equalization of the position of local governments to state authorities in the search for a deep storage for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of inadequate rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform for Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that decisions on the selection of a location for potential storage should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) was driven to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, eventually he was scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
That did the trick.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new physique at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The chubby character from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John joked that his friends and family would always ask him to lose weight because his large body would cause furniture to break.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, Exercise.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it is text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, such as a university-level one, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain it more precisely.
There are different types of bosses for everything.
Games like Dark Souls have several bosses, so a "boss" is like the ruler or master of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), even able to be called something?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the phrase "boss" into one word in any language, including Czech and other languages (Catalan is an interesting exception, which translates "boss" as "final enemy").
It is simply a computer-controlled, stronger-than-all-previous opponent that is significant to the story or game in general, guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for Peter from London who has gone missing.
The Czech police have also joined in.
British police have been searching for Peter Srncové since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
A 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since December 7th.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncovou was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called Yellow Notice for her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has now been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slender, has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
It should originate from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, the local MP, also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We have great concerns about it," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what he had to do with Petra.
Czech Christmas Terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, attacks significantly intensified.
We observed a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
Attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
Attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected email attachment is designed to grab the user's attention with a name that references payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, but this time it was labeled as "Copy of Receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials which are then sent to attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, attacker activity is again on the rise.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists have mostly detected campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks occurred continuously throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
Formbook contained most commonly an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The term "receipt" is still used.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of the smart ones who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was larger than the media reported.
Based on the shots of the procession along the waterfront and my experience of the demonstrator, I estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the quay and bridge, as well as the opposite quay road.
That means people really care a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I assert that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Chcípl pes organization have been gaining in popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be formed from this discontentment, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine does not become a four or more dose vaccine.
It definitely won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certain to become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change at the helm.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to assemble a government of a broad coalition that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties proclaiming a fight against corruption and abuse of power, however, were unable to reach an agreement, so two more premature elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
A global hit from secretly taken footage.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns were growing about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, the former employer of the children's hospital worker and the Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about her.
"Peta's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, in a video on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
A missing Czech woman reportedly left work and headed home to the Camberwell area around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help to find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
An anonymous informant reported that Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (a regional Pirate Party councilor) from Šumperk, an amateur painter of children's rooms, is violating copyright with her paintings.
The court ruled that the paintings of Krtek in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Usti nad Labem, there was a moon-shaped hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD), which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained open.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate began "intensively resolving the situation".
