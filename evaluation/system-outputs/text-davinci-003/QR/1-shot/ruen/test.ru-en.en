From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac's age ladies based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very Balzacian ladies.
And the psychology and sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally not interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
Model "Prestige Micro-Pack": Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is well ventilated naturally, as is coir coconut.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The manufacturer's official warranty period is 5 years, but in practice the mattress has a longer service life.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Purchase a orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress – it is recommended for supporting optimal spine position while sleeping.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the doorstep, and cutlets are still sizzling on the stove, mother is bustling around mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
And then mop the floor and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning afterwards.
And the guests?
They are doing well, and they must bring a cake with them.
Since then I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook them treats, I bake just for fun very often.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccination is Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
Ulrich Weigel, the head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11th by Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required by summer at the latest, fall at the latest," says the expert.
Furthermore, Wiegel hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be administered "in combination with a flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron".
Moreover, the new version is especially dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging for an acceleration of vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zaltsberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, as Zaltzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omikron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling in this regard," emphasized the expert.
Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib 54 Silent 54mm 8.5g Wobbler.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) stands out from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for bottom fishing, not just for casting.
These lures have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogs, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top knob made of strong and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when wired vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is the simplest monotonous animation, that is, the movements of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
Additionally, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib can tease a passive pike, which does not even react to bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib shows its range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with both monofilament and braided lines of even large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or carp, in addition to uniform trolling, sometimes with "tapping" on the bottom, is also effective.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch the treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class, the Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, consequently, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12th, by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt),” - Anadolu agency quotes him.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence.
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirt, as well as an airbase in Jufra, noted in the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where Else Can Mercenaries Be Found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in either the military or the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind that previously the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto serves as the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy Through the Eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes – “protected and restored peace in Syria”, “decision on ‘Nord Stream-2’”, “scared the whole world with tough armament”, “we took back Crimea”.
The main failures – “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world” – are mentioned in the research of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government announced a complete rejection of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirates news agency WAM.
"Today marks the start of a new stage of digitalisation of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of cars in Turkey have fallen below the 2020 level.
Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November amid devaluation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November in Turkey 115 thousand cars were released from factories, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
If the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11th month of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB subjects received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium businesses, according to the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year in accordance with the order of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of April 9, 2021 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses", - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the order of granting payment deferral on loans provided for granting by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, payment deferral on loans issued to MSB subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
In the borrower's statement, another deferment period for payments could be indicated.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and enforcement work, notification of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments were suspended," noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
For 2021, applications for loan payment deferment were submitted to second-tier banks by 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SME subjects received deferment for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
"The MFO has received applications for deferment from 131 MSB subjects, of which deferment was granted to 95 subjects for the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily transmit the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, it became very rapid.
Apparently, he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe than he should have, their antibodies weren't cut down during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That's what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s just get away with a sneeze.
The immune response of the young man is completely inadequate: where he could only threaten with his finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left side, as well as abdominal pain, can also be a sign of an emerging problem.
Meanwhile in Russia, by the end of the year they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, like kindergarteners, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the Genomic Engineering Laboratory of MIPT.

Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid.
The authors of the study examined the fat tissue remaining from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is likely capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin named the causes of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
To prevent the onset of WHO diseases, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities requiring the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud, reported this on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
The department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector reported that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the artifacts returned was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4th, where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This provoked dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively striving for the repatriation of illegally exported antiquities from the country at different times in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) - are an independent people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have shifted to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse officially does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is independent but well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegova" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
The main success was that on the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet has been honored with such an honor as Sergei Alexandrovich, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was settling down and there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Above the empty and deserted field.
Like a grove in September.
Alcohol is raining brains.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had deteriorated greatly, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
Recurring bouts of depression and nervous breakdowns are becoming more common.
And the cause is likely not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis – alcoholism – was given to Sergei Aleksandrovich by someone, no reliable documents remain.
Let's say, related to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under Professor Petras Gannushkin (Esenin would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
And there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this soil, and calls to the police - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev, for a short time.
Amazingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev remembers:
He would only come to stay the night and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, spraying the sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm almost done and I stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
"And I drank because loneliness gnawed at me."

All his energy is directed towards choosing what he will earn a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic issues with the law before the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely".
Why did the girl start crying on the exam before she even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
She will have a tail.
So what?

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonsky, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also convinced that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many points of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, it was announced that restrictive measures against the republic will be further expanded "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that have previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not Suitable for Sergei": When a Velvet Jacket Makes a Man a Joke
Velvet blazers were the dominant fashion at 2021 social events.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry blazer and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore an outfit that did not conform to the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, first wearing a green velvet jacket and then opting for a more classic look at an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was adopted by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to the analytics of the service, reported to "Gazeta.Ru", their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury blazer segment from velvet this season, almost all brands are represented - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, which was worn by the brand ambassador Jared Leto at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
When choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also serve for a shorter period of time accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin of Lamoda warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to consider when choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should have the right advanced company with enough money," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from those who organize this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If an employee is of a lower rank and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka's hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so rehearsed and drawn out.
And not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion dollar investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy sources are also not in demand - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A drop of a penny.
Who's flying then?
As usual - the average customer.
Does the Sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, it is not advisable to consider Western politicians as idiots, "sleeping through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good deed.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Mediocrity within the average of passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they won't be sat next to, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he voluntarily describes the beauties of slave life and extols a kind and good master is a flatterer and a hypocrite.
The immunologist stated that revaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination within four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Under the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign to take up revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has been vaccinated and then contracted the disease, or has contracted the disease and then been vaccinated, then they have acquired 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," clarified the expert.
The G7 warned Russia of "significant consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the "G7" (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, United States, France and Japan) released a statement following the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations to transparency in military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also declared.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation for our common and comprehensive response," is also stated in the statement.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omikron-strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other forms of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
Scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omikron-strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev.
Ukraine's Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone destruction.
It is noted that later Berlin softened his position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev is aiming to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the USA, the UK, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects Germany to be a "technical partner" of Ukraine, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

It is a disgrace for a philologist.

Years... a long time ago I did the same remodeling.
Combined the living room with the kitchen.
The apartment is three-room.
It was.

They made a bookcase in the hallway and a large wardrobe.

A table appeared on the screen, showing what percentage of these semiconductors (presumably chips-microcontrollers) each country produces.
Russia was not on this list.
That's it!

But besides hatred, gossip, and scandals, there is nothing special to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she lived her life in bitterness.
Mercedes lodged a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The German team "Mercedes", whose pilot Lewis Hamilton finished second in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind "Red Bull" driver Max Verstappen, has filed a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.

According to the second - Fersappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
We should add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Vettel overtook Hamilton by 2,256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship is preliminary until the protests of Mercedes are considered.

Ways to recover stolen money from online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Their findings were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Additionally, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19th, member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Belarus border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be calling on Schulz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravcsek, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disputes.
The European Court has fined Poland for establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not taken on any public obligations to stop the "Nord Stream-2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials have informed members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional staffer in the United States reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so the second window is partially visible.
Those who are unfamiliar with the initial layout are in doubt.
I know these apartments very well and I can see perfectly how they have been redesigned.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when people write about ways to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something, that you have to literally scrub off.
Just don't let it get dirty.

Doctors have warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before coronavirus vaccination.

The Chief Preventive Medicine Officer of the Ural Federal District, the scientific supervisor of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants randomly and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and starting to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And upon preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He donated the find to the church and, according to him, he didn't even receive a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the find is related to the theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of twenty-five thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount since the award's validity period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially allocated a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers here," as it is written here.
There are people richer than her, but not all of them behave so brazenly and provocatively as this lady.

"The situation is even more serious when considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barrozo noted.
Previously, the authorities of Brazil have required unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Merited Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and applying a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, a large number of immunoglobulins A are formed. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
After vaccination, we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies) inside.
"And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in combination with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help those that in such a case the organism's protection should presumably become maximal.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Anna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who has long since passed away) like this - if you're willing to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a female dog, then go ahead.
But the parrot was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
Believe me, it's not taken out of thin air.
I have held back many owners so that they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand were running away (from Pomsk), I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 Thousand" chose a master, not a dog running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination by opponents continue in Europe.
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
From February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's policies in the field of health care, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held up signs that said "This is a false pandemic", "I will not vaccinate".
A large protest rally against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In an autonomous community, a COVID-19 certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The authorities of several regions of the country have decided to introduce sanitary passports in response to the increasing number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement personnel used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

WHO has already detected "omicron" in sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, by December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This was despite it only becoming actively distributed from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, in terms of spread, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Before this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omikron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of those infected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people in the Kingdom currently suffering from the "micronom" and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak hospitals will be taking more than 2,000 people a day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than with other types of illness.
It is unknown how the Russian satellite V will react to the "Omikron" – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.
Why do we need to see stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE more detailed execution of your exercises.
It is unclear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on the heels or standing on the knees, as written, but then how to lean on the thighs with the hands?
Hands on the hips?
Curious Little Rabbit, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, it is easy and relaxed to communicate, but when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
And to see a person live, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't catch - hence the attitude.
When one meets their person, then their outlooks will change.
Again, the Soviet era is called "the time of the bez."
People believed in God much more honestly back then than they do today.
And they were raised practically according to God's laws (love for the neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today – money at any cost.
Globes of faith are scarce for boasters like Globe (or even nonexistent), but even if so, the time of the gods has come in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina Street still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe it was connected to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing each other more and more at funerals.
Lara, for Heaven's sake!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, fussy, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's a shame that they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but no bumper cars!
And what for?
Did he push his brother without calculating his strength?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.

India became the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters.
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is disinformation.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious hacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Varonis' lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It was a provincial store, but there WAS such a product.
In big cities, Muslim women were painted and their beauty was displayed.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions are listed that can help prevent diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not give this much importance, and that is a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only an improper diet but also habits can influence the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to exercise a lot.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often "weekend fatigue", said Zukhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific supervisor of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine, in her Telegram channel.
According to her, those who work hard often suffer from headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to a change in conditions.
On weekends our life changes drastically.
"Let's sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "A small breakdown starts due to lack of coffee."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness.
A late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jetlag will occur.
It arises in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended to observe what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have declared the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "Omikron") corresponds to the efficacy of the vaccine at 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection," the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the Omicroon strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index - may be indicated under an unfamiliar word in the product composition.
On the label there may be several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other hidden sugars may also be present, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to count the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"So in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the US had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Previously, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, it was stated in the course of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not comply with the requirements" of the European Union.
Thank you for the interesting photos!
In 1985 I had to travel to those parts.
I vividly remember the funicular going up from Kanatchikovo station, past the old building (resembling a centralization post, two-story), along Kanatchikovsky passage, and turning right onto Vavilov Street, towards the factory gates...
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Indian Prime Minister.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
The Modo office asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the premiere stated that they quickly reacted on Twitter - access to the account was restored.
India's Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12th, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's residents voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 inhabitants of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse agency commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence called on voters to abstain from voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
As the separatists declared, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, President of France Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak at the conclusion of this referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major topic of discussion in the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their support for the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated on numerous occasions.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be the choice of France".
Hi, Sveta!

Turkey tested the world's first unmanned aerial vehicle with laser weapons.
In Turkey, successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weapons have been conducted.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of remotely neutralizing explosive objects using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV must be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the need for sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the US.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of the relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite as one front against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant they will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11th, this was reported by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," he is quoted as saying by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory by the end of the next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of an unmanned aerial vehicle was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General Staff had previously classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in Donbas.
On December 6th, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is planning to use drones.
On September 29th, Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev Oblast for personnel training, testing, and servicing of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions settled on the roof of a container.
The animals could not move away from him due to the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranqulizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Research shows that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express publication.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take Vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to always monitor the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain has called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is contained in avocados, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April due to the Omikron strain, around 75,000 people may die.
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people in England may die in the next five months due to the spread of the Omikron strain of coronavirus, if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies of the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25,000 deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the illness, hospitals will be receiving more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Strict measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines fail to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the speed of the Omicroon strain spread remains at its current level, then by the end of the year, around 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country.
By the middle of December, the Omicroon strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently in the UK, 1898 cases of Omicroon-strain coronavirus infection have been detected, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On December 9th, the head of the British Department of Health, Sadjid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown in the world by a quarter.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world register of ships was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a frenzy on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the wealthy do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause resentment in society, as the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of the keel over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
Superyachts now commonly feature helipads, outdoor cinemas, and on some, such as boxer Mike Tyson's, even a wrestling ring. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning if we consider that there are slightly more than 2000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail went to his 162.5 meter long yacht Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from others when, like Australia's wealthiest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't realize how intelligent four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence has developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond consecutively to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in the Sciencealert publication.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they understand nothing of politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Experts believe that some breeds of dogs show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data to make accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labrador Retrievers.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade negotiations between the US and Russia.
The US and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't bargain, but just send away the one offering it.
"A trade deal is in the works for Ukraine," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are done secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and counter-forces deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Expo held in the city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies to ensure increased reliability and operational performance of rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China were rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd., intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaojiang.
After more than 60 years of intense work, carrying out a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yao-shan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as inability to concentrate, plan, and reduced level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about hearing loss being both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Goloshekin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of dementia can be helped by studying foreign languages and engaging in active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic," said Goloshekin.
The UK's leading dementia research charity has previously stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian ombudsman, to journalists.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"Problems with mobility, coordination, and variability of character are stable problems," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7th, Saakashvili began to refuse medical assistance after staff of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
Approximately 3,000 people participated in the rally in the Catalan capital.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
On their posters they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions for unvaccinated people are also planned to be introduced.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR-code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of a past illness or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and plane trips.

Steep Rise: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow the 1 trillion yuan set by President Xi Jinping to be collected, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taiwu in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Organizing Committee's advisor, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Seventy-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
On the slopes, eateries with dishes of national cuisine are opening.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach a world-class level.
More than 5 billion people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO has stated.
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress in universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have stated.
In connection with the 12th of December International Day for Universal Health Coverage, WHO and WB have published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister Disconnected from "Summit for Democracy" Broadcast at White House Request
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the Summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters Agency citing sources claims that the picture was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked on it as green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the "Zero Day" summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, chief editor of "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation's Council of Ministers, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Therefore, a fairy tale about ecology for fools was invented, who will also work on garbage collection for free for the idea.
My personal contribution to ecology is to avoid buying unnecessary things and to use items for a long time.
If I go beyond the limits - I don't throw away, but give to charity.

Sketches of a Country Muscovite.
Don't lump them all together - there are bad people out there, and you may have specific grievances against them...
But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on?
Write that they are "scoundrels, they didn't return the money".
It's none of your business how many and when they have children until they hang them around your neck.
Since this is excluded, what right do you have to judge them?
I guess it's only in education that it's like that...
The chosen (self-appointed) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this applies to other areas of life, such as the judiciary and so on?
For them, the laws are not written.
What if Dad does end up implementing his own method of upbringing and education?
It's a terrible example and a very bad example for others.

China is strengthening prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossings are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities with land border crossings must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day that the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
The Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Ryabkov, assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with "Izvestia".
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some kind of improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long journey we have taken with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The head of the Foreign Ministry added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is being made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal preparation against COVID outside the hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize points of intranasal vaccination in airports and shopping centers, but I would do this initially only in medical institutions.
The thing is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centers will be possible when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

They say that those who truly believe make up the church.
Whether there are truly believers or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would wish to be truly believing, and each strives to be so.
But no one should speak either of himself or of those who believe as he does, that they alone are truly believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then so can others.

This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that are imposing anti-Russian sanctions.
Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said an official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It has been reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Additionally, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank head German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
This was announced on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of ballots.
The voter turnout on that day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to abstain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the "omicron" strain is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
There is also data showing a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“severity of illness”) may be less severe than with “Delta”, according to a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are progressing either mildly or asymptomatically.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron-strain have been registered.
They "had previously been immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky have been named.
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios of development for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its involvement.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices of key commodities that we traditionally export are decreasing <...> internal protests and resistance from the government with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups) ", added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to internal opposition within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of people who disagree with President Zelensky and the president himself, which could lead to the seizure of control over the security bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting of power", added Denisenko.
Another script - transformation of Zelensky into "father of the nation".
Some event may lead to this which will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow it was noted that it is precisely the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the USA that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11th, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming Ukrainian presidential elections, only 21.8% of the vote would be cast for incumbent President Zelensky, while 14.5% would be cast for former President Petro Poroshenko.
Among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very sad to find out such news.

I'm buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The inner side part of the cup, in the area of the straps attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated through the festoon along the decollete and under the bust.
Vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl up in larger sizes.

Arrested for a rally on Red Square, the poet said: "They give 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained at Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetsofRussiaisbiggerthanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol for an administrative article on repeated violation of the order of conducting a public action.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his message.
How were the police officers treating you during this and previous arrests?
What were they asking in the department about your action?
This time the staff were more courteous, the detention was as polite as possible, however funny that may sound in some contexts of the word.
OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
They asked the usual questions about motives.
When heard, in principle, looked at if not approvingly, then understanding.
Except for the four-way-breathing monkey, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action under this hashtag people start writing their own poems, even a few, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk alone in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
At public and official events, people speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and yet still relies on an interpreter.
At official events, stenography is still done by hand according to the old method, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

The root crop contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the systems of the organism to function.
Additionally, potatoes help in fighting age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of potassium, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or stewed, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as with other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with high carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in their production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current product shortage can only be compensated by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Candidates for Departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Russian Internet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search engine results from both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but, judging by the video quality, this is what is called a bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.

Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190.
Orthopedic Pocket Spring Mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness – high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product is made up of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: a block of independent micro-packet springs is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated for the sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", therefore it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered with latex, the other is covered with coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillers has long been considered a classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If a coil provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Cover: Model comes with a stretchy Aloe Vera fabric cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
Overall height of the product – 27 cm, recommended load on the sleeping place – 170 kg.
Warranty and Safety: Warranty Period – 3 Years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday by "Actual Camera".
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus is to arrive.
Suppose we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
"If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Payusalu.

Metaverse will transform Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digital assetization, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred into a digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy and unhealthy.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but nobody is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are ten weekends ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
How much hellish work, time, and resources she had to put in for her training.
And after performing five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
She also realizes that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, meaning she will never be an Olympic champion.
And those who have not been through the sport or cannot imagine the circles of hell she has gone through, DO NOT JUDGE.
The British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices of goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has already run its course" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates taking into account inflation will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Additionally, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized by O'Neill.
Previously, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Research Department at Discovery Investments, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, although the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary and credit policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in last September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia leads in terms of revenue in the Russian market.
In the 10 months of this year he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
The related Kia brand of Hyundai has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
Hyundai is leading in terms of increasing the average car price - over the year, it has grown by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase dynamics.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow as significantly: according to the statistics of the Automakers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has seen both sales volume (up 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) increase.
Mercedes-Benz is experiencing both good sales growth and an average weighted price - higher, for example, than BMW - which is leading to increased financial capacity, explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
Chinese brands have demonstrated fantastic growth rates in sales, significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units in 2021 have dropped from the level of the previous year include, in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of supply problems with auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly reprice their products and other automakers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the conditions of car shortage, I think that many car manufacturers were even able to partially transfer to the consumer the expenses of previous periods, which they could not include in the price of cars before.
Vladimir Bespalov, analyst at VTB Capital, speaks on the automotive industry.
I assume that automakers are feeling very good financially right now, sustaining a high margin of sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices observed throughout 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantity and in money terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With increasing supply, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, and car manufacturers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
No minimum increase in the production of machines is expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by the citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, according to an expert.
Biden expressed his opinion on the redeployment of US military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership has never considered sending American military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
President of the United States Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack from Russia" - Biden declared.
Previously, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
He also indicated that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's use of drones supplied by Turkey in combat, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I leave such interviews right away.

If a scammer calls from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement structure, it is not effective to hang up immediately, and it is unlikely to have time to add it to the blacklist.

The maximum number of awards this time was received by the film of Jasmina Žbanić (Bosnia) "Where Are You Going, Aida?".
The main heroine of the film is a translator at the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
