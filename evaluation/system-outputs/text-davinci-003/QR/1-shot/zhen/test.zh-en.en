At Zhejiang University's Academic Conference, students sang the lead role and the research results opened up new possibilities - Xinhua News.
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of creative academic achievements were commended, such as using air to wash hands, using smell to judge diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Care Doctor
PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor for smartphones, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe lightly and this apparatus can detect the initial health condition of your body from the components of the exhaled air."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: Doctors' High-Powered Eyes
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded a silver prize at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new line of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are detected and removed too late due to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the distinction between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing hands: saving water and being cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by simply rinsing them with water, at most rubbing some soap on them or squeezing some hand sanitizer, whereas Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a "air hand-washing device".
As soon as we step onto the apparatus of the washbasin, our weight will compress the air out.
It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air, forming a fluid at the tap, combines with the water.
So, we can get our hands nice and clean!
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue tests have proven that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as with ordinary handwashing.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring both a high level of cleanliness and a 90% water savings, with the entire process being completely energy-free and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

No problem, thank you.
A certificate that makes a lot of sense - a first aid certificate.
This is one of the skill certificates I consider important besides my driver's license!
To put it simply: First aid is emergency assistance in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is most critical.
This was the time for urgent action.
If I were to suffer a cardiac arrest, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then I would have only four minutes to save my life, the golden four minutes!
So it is important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue them with professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous.
On average, 15% of the nation can be saved in the United States.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, eighty percent can be saved, but in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than one percent.
This was the first reaction of the founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be done in order to have a chance of saving the person.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
It might even save someone's life!
First aid certificates can be signed up for at your local Red Cross training centre - I signed up at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai and there were student discounts too.
The last picture is a record of goals to be achieved before the age of 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was something that happened a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
After that I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
13 dumplings for only one!?
I have never tried.
How come #NAME# isn't making it clear?
Is it thirteen dollars?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered only one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code I entered was valid before.
To conclude, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say that the movie wasn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack was pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that will make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that will make you angry after watching it, and "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting his audience.
What makes this film most painful is that it seems like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like Gregor Samsa's overcoat.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but upon closer inspection you find it's just a pile of crap.
To start off simply, I find some of the plot points hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part of the world, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person riding in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father were very reassured by this.
Then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why are the island's biker gang thugs able to easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck driver could not be found anywhere around.
This reference is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a delinquent and criminally-suspected biker gang member become a police auxiliary?
In the movie, why didn't the person facing usury report it to the police, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key to open a hotel door, and then has to resort to sleeping outside the room door because they can't find the hotel manager?
This bizarre plot runs throughout the film, and the plot is so far-fetched that I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, was the movie's theme, or rather the lack of one, which was just an ugly patchwork of cliches.
At the beginning of the movie you would think he was trying to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you might guess it was a motivational film, halfway through you felt it could be a story about how hard it is for a small town youth to survive, and after watching it you had no idea what you had just seen, followed by deep doubt about why you had gone to the cinema to appreciate excrement over the holidays.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the tropes of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character just burned and then still managed to sing), you can't go and open up some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
As for the female lead clearly not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I'm also quite puzzled as to why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement during the Spring Festival to give the audience a headache?

Checking the concrete well wall brick module production and processing equipment: Introduction to Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment.
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of domestic concrete inspection well module brick machines, inspection well block machinery, and well wall wall module machinery, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have quality-assured, mainly hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Checking the Concrete Well Module Production and Processing Equipment: The Features and Advantages of Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment
Yixin's inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other new masonry materials.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooves on the top, bottom, left and right sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of masonry walls is far superior to that of flat masonry construction forms.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being combined and laid, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are connected. After the hole cores are poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are provided with transverse and longitudinal grooves, and the transverse lapping and longitudinal insertion correspondingly enhance the overall strength of the structure.
Additionally, inspection wells and drainage wells constructed with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking, or leakage, and the mechanical performance of the well wall modules is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output device, one-button touch LCD display monitoring, mechanical operation of all processes, to achieve the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic transmission and double cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the influence of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box advances the model box demoulding, the storage bin door closes, the automatic conveying pallet, all completes independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieves the reduction of the mechanical attrition and the maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, sealing parts hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table line cutting and molding are weldless, which makes the filling box free to swing and guide, and fully reduces mechanical wear.
By reducing the mould load, combining the filling and compaction amplitude, and using integrated and fully synchronous table vibration and mould vibration, the vibration-solidification effect can be ensured.
The wall-climbing module vibrator uses mechanical vibration and computer automatic control to adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of the raw materials, without wear and tear, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall module has both mechanical automatic control and manual control functions.

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting a modern apprenticeship program, where students are accepted as quasi-employees of the enterprise - Xinhua News.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, a tripartite agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, the school and the enterprise. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, the guardians, the school and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools are reforming their talent cultivation model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
Taking the cultivation of the system as a pilot period, the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program, and the top-post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, step by step from points to surfaces, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, increase the employment rate and quality of students.

After considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, I finally made the tough decision and the suction effect is good. The dust in the house has obviously decreased a lot, but it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; the wet mop needs to be improved, and there will be dust marks when taking it off and on; overall, I am still very satisfied.
The kitchen appliance is quite heavy and looks high-end, suitable for kitchen novices like me. My kids said it tastes better than what I cook myself. I have cooked two dishes with meat and two dishes with vegetables, and the sweet and sour spare ribs are especially delicious. It takes a bit longer for some dishes, but the others are very quick. The noise is very low, so I don't have to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook!
After receiving the goods, I couldn't wait to fry three dishes at noon. Technology really changes life. The control of heat and seasoning is accurate, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the chef level. It's not bad. It's a great tool for those who are not good at cooking. Highly recommended to buy!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machines, the kind that automatically regulate the temperature and automatically stir-fry.
No more fear of being scalded by hot oil, no more fear of overcooking or undercooking food due to lack of control over the heat.
The stir-fried dishes tasted much better than what I made; the tomato and egg stir-fry was especially flavorful, and the eggs had a great texture.
This pot was a good buy.
The item is good and worth buying, very nice.
Overall, it is well-structured and clear, consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and easy on the eyes, and no other abnormalities have been noticed so far.

South African doctors: Omecamivir has strong transmission power but mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, the Omnicron variant, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of over five thousand doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are milder, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organisation, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalisation.
Pieri said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this included elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who were more likely to become severely ill from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people are going to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported outbreak of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it took several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of recent hospitalised COVID-19 patients have been severely ill, half of the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications point to this being a milder disease."
He also said, "It is still early, and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delta still being the major coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omikron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the first week of December saw a 400% increase in new cases in Hauden Province, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for over 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Educational Times: What Does it Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we take the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", collective prevention and public anti-kidnapping will make kidnapping activities unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to quickly locate abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app, "Reunion," I felt a warmth and comfort.
The new technical means not only have a name of "artistic" and full of sentiment, but also are properly used in informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of kidnapping enforcement is to recover the kidnapped child and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Second comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is broken, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
We should set aside for careful discussion topics of great controversy such as "should child trafficking be punished by death without exception" in the urgent pursuit of "rescue", but the rescue of trafficked children must not be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in an abduction can mean a step further away from the parents for the child, and an increase in the difficulty of solving the case.
In this case, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "law and order" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
In order to combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Furthermore, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It cannot be expected that a two-year-old child has enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest or placing children under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of law enforcement against trafficking crimes, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years; for particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
With the trend of "leniency in punishment" and the high starting point and maximum penalty for punishment, trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
To this day, there are still a large number of human trafficking cases occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot be done solely through strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" of trafficking is widely present, traffickers driven by profit motives will constantly innovate their trafficking methods, forming a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcement, and anti-trafficking efforts will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Malan Mountain.
Draw strength from the Party's hundred-year struggle history.
On the morning of December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a standing member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department, gave an interactive lecture at the Ma'anshan Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, learn and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and learn and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects - ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and the Youth League, and the Party's leadership and theory - to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that in order to learn the spirit of the whole conference and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech in Hunan, it is necessary to combine and integrate the spirit of the provincial party committee conference, strengthen the ideological, political and action consciousness of defending the "two establishements" and achieving the "two maintainances", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives from the grassroots, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements," how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and commitment with youth dedication.

It is unclear whether the mistake was made by the store or the delivery rider.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Unable to trace.
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been swapped in.
He had been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the middle of dealing with something.
Waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as cold-pressed olive oil, is a fat obtained from fresh olives by mechanical cold-pressing and filtering to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a completely natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant aroma, and an acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavour, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil, to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction from the pomace and refined by solvent extraction.
Having seen the grading classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used for winemaking, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
The best place for olive trees to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only grow the crop sporadically in suitable habitats.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries further south in latitude with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, etc.
The months for harvesting olives:
From March to June each year is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for harvesting the fruit (freshness is very important for olive oil).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who would brazenly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the Democratic Summit focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day."
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening remarks of the day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of minorities in China such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and grassroots social leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guanzhong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not realised the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a video address of the "National Statement," emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used public health and collective interests as an excuse to justify the infringement of human rights, indicating a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down to control the epidemic, nor do we need to take down to defeat false information.
On the second day of the "Summit on Democracy," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, while also imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time kept getting delayed.
It was originally supposed to be number.
Anyway, I'm not calling.
Not eating.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
The diner waited for an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# has not been sent yet.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the salivating chicken that the restaurant sent is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something similar at a similar price to practice with first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices often correlate with friendliness, and if you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones, and these "entry-level" ones are actually industrial junk.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of this is - tennis is so hard to learn, you know you won't be able to, and you won't want to buy an expensive one, so let's give you a cheap one, you'll play it twice and then you won't play it anymore, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come back to me and buy the expensive stuff, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, choosing Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not famous enough so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200, isn't it enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to beginners, but it becomes useless after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
Could you please help me follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salted chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# asked me to take it for no reason, please cancel it.
The order I placed was for delivery, there was no option for self-collection.

Actually, there are many considerations for dressing well for girls who are slightly overweight.
The skirt of a chubby girl should not be too short or too long, the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the chubby part of the thigh.
Wearing a skirt that is too short will reveal any fat on the legs.
Being too tall can give the impression of being short and stout.
If you wear a three-piece outfit with a top, skirt, and long socks in different colors, it will give you a slimming effect and make you look taller naturally.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and elegant black skirts are the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly plump girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Plump girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with fine grids). Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and match it with a drape neck top, which can cover up the shortcomings of plump girls very well.
Of course, even the plump girl has her own standards when it comes to wearing short skirts.
For a plus-sized girl wearing a short skirt, it is best to choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, as this will give the effect of adding height to your fuller figure.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the most IN look for the summer!
If you are an MM with a top-heavy figure but slim legs, a glamorous mini dress is recommended.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your assets.
A-line skirts are slimming and are a good choice for plus-size girls. To create a slimming effect, choose a tighter top to create a layered look.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can be tried by chubby MMs as well.
Even chubby girls can dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls can be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in the way you dress, make sure to exercise more in your daily life and try to get out of the label of "slightly chubby girl" earlier😄

Girl as target for sister's fundraising: "It's better to think of it as flesh wounds" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board, slightly taller than a person, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passersby can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Lower Town Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girls warned for "arrow target" fundraising on the street
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "human target, ten yuan per arrow". On another board in front of her are written her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens considered this to be a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd, and at that time there were already quite a few onlookers."
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and attractive clothing.
The girl who was the "human target" was crying and asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was standing by and shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for an operation, asking everyone to help.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukaemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But since the treatment still required more than 300,000 in expenses, they had no better way to raise funds and resorted to this action.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were present, one as the target and one as the shooter, but neither of them actually participated in the shooting. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police were assessed by the security department, the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The head of the department stated, "We do not advocate taking this kind of showy fundraising approach."
After being warned by the police officers at the station, she had left the station.
Heat dissipation: Good; Thinness: Convenient; Appearance material: Satisfactory; Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable and the four exhaust outlets provide good cooling, making it a great recommendation.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon laptop is really good, with good craftsmanship and reliable brand!
The Acer Predator Triton 500 is still not too expensive in terms of price.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The game performance is smooth, allowing me to play most games with a high frame rate. My chicken dinner is very smooth, and LOL is no problem. CSGO is also easily handled, and most AAA games can be played.
Cooling Performance: The cooling performance is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and the gaming performance is still not small when the fan is fully opened.
Appearance and Material: The appearance is cool and stylish, the gaming laptop looks great. Display Effect: The screen is clear, 1080 is enough for gaming.
Buying the laptop felt really good, mainly for design purposes, with a good cost-performance ratio, lighter than expected, and better looking than imagined. The red on the back is a very nice wine color, not too flashy, much higher than expected overall, worth the purchase, and suitable for girls too.
I started using the Macro Night Knight two years ago and after two years, it has a good cost-performance ratio and is of high quality!
I have also recommended this product to my friends around me!
Three machines from this series have already been purchased!
It has a nice look and good configuration.
I had planned to buy something for my nephew when the 418 bank activity was on, but he needed it urgently so I bought it in advance and missed out on the big bank activity, which was a bit of a shame.
The cost-performance ratio is quite high and the logistics are quite fast, so let's come back and review it after a while.
A brand new, high value-for-money gaming laptop, with a great design style, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Showing results: Bought a computer for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work performance.
He said it was very good for the son he bought it for.
The computer is great, especially with the good customer service attitude. Ask questions if you don't understand and I recommend buying it.
The graphics of the game are really nice, not bad.
What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can absolutely take the lead in many projects and no one can match them: Moving bricks, business trips, and all-nighters are the daily life of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
A seemingly jokey article, it also speaks to the daily struggles of project managers, representing the feeling of helplessness in current project management work.
Meanwhile, personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of applicants for the PMP (Project Management Professional Certification) each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)," as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 people passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The increasing number of PMP certified professionals over the past decade shows that more and more project managers are aware that simply relying on old "experience" is no longer feasible, and the ever-changing work environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
Does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners have stated that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management related knowledge points, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, project dragging on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, project difficult to advance...
Therefore, having focused on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D personnel, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It has brought the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
The "Project Manager Bootcamp" online course is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods from research-oriented enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the path of advancing your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training of project managers at lower costs and with less investment, resulting in efficient operational outcomes for the business.
To get a better idea, you can take a look at what other students have said about the course: This course is not only delivered by the Zhongtianhua experts team (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help students to apply the learning content to specific work after class.

Jiexin advocated rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 17.7 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The various discounts and coupons, as well as the eye-catching live streaming of goods, have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumer boom has made people marvel at the strength of national consumption, but on the other hand, it is necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Ahead of the arrival of "Double Twelve," Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large disparities in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
Elderly people and teenagers have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Creditease has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In recent years, CITIC has carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, launched various forms of innovative practice competitions to subtly influence the rational consumption needs of young groups, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts, plan consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer loan misunderstanding, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is important to plan ahead and spend within one's means and repay on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as car buying and house buying.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Credit China will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified financial products with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour included Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and his Arab allies to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused it of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely impacted the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative effect on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the effort to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolving their differences to restore relations with Qatar came from the requirement to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations.
Its goal was to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has slowed the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the Gulf Union and to propose measures for its member states to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the supercar exhaust sound is the loudest in the New Mountain area!
This car that our team has brought to you all is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price tag of nearly two million Ringgit, a yearly road tax of over ten thousand Ringgit, and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
Well, even the editor doesn't know, but the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while it takes the editor's Myvi to reach 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Not much needs to be said about the model, just Google it and the editor has put together some explanations that may not be found on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, it's so uncomfortable! (But kind of cool).
One kilometer of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't really care).
Practice getting on and off the train, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is so loud that you will be temporarily deaf after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The body of the car is too big, so parking in a regular spot would be too narrow and I'm afraid it would get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely since there's no one to compete with on the road (said by the editor, not related to the car owner, haha).
Don't be mistaken, the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us!

Involving a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be familiar to car enthusiasts; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, a foreign millionaire crashed his million-dollar Porsche 911 and million-dollar Bugatti Chiron in just a few minutes!
As it turns out, you were right!
Resonating the University Spirit with the Times - Xinhua News
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and global educational, technological, and talent competitions are intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side," is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines," not only did it demonstrate the confidence and determination of our country in advancing from a higher education power to a higher education strong power, but it also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a shorter period of time, accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having firm goals, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic personnel, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, making use of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catch-up to the world's advanced level.
It must be especially noted that constructing world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its own personality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The school's characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowment of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our school-running: firstly, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise combination, and form a whole chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; thirdly, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the shared values of "Diligence, Virtue, Clarity, and Pragmatism," and the latest expression of the Zhejiang Spirit of "Harnessing Rivers and Oceans, Cultivating True Virtue, Opening Up the World, and Building Our Nation" all constitute the Zhejiang Spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, embodying the mentality of "using talents from all over the world"; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research innovation, reform and development, and innovation; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share weal and woe with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of education.
"The wise hear without listening, the discerning see without looking."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly becoming popular, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a total transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue is over 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The success of Axie Infinity has spread a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles, they can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of ownership is not granted by the game developer, but is secured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock, my biggest takeaway was the importance of choosing the right industry for investment, namely the target industry. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 1000 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth potential, considering the industry's optimal growth state in 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Fill 'er up for the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," or to do things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the correct thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics in landing, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, beyond thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); beyond improving customer retention (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); beyond increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; beyond increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listing it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment aperture of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft-fork upgrade called "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups have filed complaints against three Ivy League universities for alleged discriminatory admissions practices - Xinhua News.
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu Kong said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria for top American universities had doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American universities had remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been engaging in "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that, relative to the number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate of all ethnicities in these three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to address this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans.
The three universities that have been complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education had not accepted it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, this appeal was also participated in by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational groups.
Tableware is needed.
The order has just been cancelled.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you help me check if it has been cancelled?
But I had already placed the order at 5:09 in the morning.
The other line is the ordering hotline, and they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the family of the property owner, Lin, on the details of the factory purchase, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt," which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, afterwards the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the house sale contract being unable to be signed for a long time.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally finding a house he liked, Mr. Lu had already paid the deposit and prepared the payment, but just as he was about to sign the contract, the seller refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
After examining the case, the court concluded that since the parties had ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, the blame could not be placed solely on the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, so the double return of the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not be liable for the breach of double return of the deposit.
After the first judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind that necessary due diligence should be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of due diligence, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" concluded on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of democracy but in fact doing the opposite, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences.
The idea of 'democracy' has long been used as a 'massive weapon of destruction' by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over its own democratic issues, claiming that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There were also voices of criticism internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Schulz, also attended the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, ethnic conflicts, and wealth differentiation becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital basis.
In his speech, US President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "we must renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them at a time when they face persistent and worrying challenges."
The US has committed to launching a year-long initiative following the Democratic Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries implement our commitments and report back on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm afraid he sent the address wrong.
Rikachou Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
Mint Environment: Average Service: Quick service. My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Tang". The Mala Tang is too fragrant, too soft and too delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is friendly.
It's been a while since I've been to Rishang, and the fruit lao is still as delicious as ever & the ingredients are all real. The first time I tried the cha siu bao, it was the southern taste I love with the soft flour!
The claypot rice was cooked to just the right degree of wetness, with a generous portion. The signature waxed chicken wings were as good as ever, and the accompanying soup was also good. The kale was also handled well...
The taste is excellent, the service is friendly, and the meat is good.
The old shop of Ritchang has been a popular spot for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden flooring.
At the entrance, you always have to wait a long time to get the claypot rice, and the claypot for the claypot rice has cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng, and the rise of various small shops serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a restaurant with seating available right away, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the main dish is excellent.
Delivery from Nichang.
Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three-cup Chicken: The side dishes are a bit too much and the chicken is slightly too little.
The main seasoning of this dish is a bit off, the underlying saltiness is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label whisky drinking ritual?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world right now, and Red Label Whisky has won the gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it would be a waste of its rich flavour.
So how do you drink Redbreast Whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction for everyone.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from around 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich fragrance.
The entry is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed either on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky entered the Chinese market, and in order to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky mixed with cola, sprite, or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks became a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralise acidity, can bring pleasure visually and add to the drink to dilute the taste and change the flavour.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink Red Whisky is with slices of lemon and sugar cubes (or sugar).
The authentic Red Vermouth has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky, and everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully this introduction from the author can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How University Exams Can Make Both "Geeks" and "Dummies" Happy - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams, and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all walks of life with varying levels of ability and different levels of learning, making the learning situation very diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who do not put in effort may be able to pass an exam by cramming before it, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there appeared the "strange phenomenon" of "underachievers" passing exams and even getting high scores without putting in much effort, while "overachievers" who never missed classes, had good homework and notes, and only scored slightly higher on exams.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in reflecting on the problems in university examinations, and it is believed that this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, one must applaud the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, it is not uncommon for university students to cram for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive to get the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets and ask teachers for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university examination is qualified or not lies more in the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
As students enter the undergraduate stage, majors begin to specialize, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge points of a subject must be fully mastered in order to be tested in university exams.
While undergraduate knowledge is mostly based on subject fundamentals and basic common sense, the space for variation in terms of knowledge points is not large and is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics that was taught 20 years ago is still being taught, and is still the focus."
But the fact that the knowledge points remain the same does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
At many universities, exam questions are usually composed by a question-setting team, and then the papers are coordinated by senior subject teachers. The marking of the exams is also carried out by all the teachers who teach the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of examination questions that are in line with teaching and learning in practice, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall situation of the students' learning, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level are also needed, so that the examination questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types of questions.
Exams are the driving force of university education; whatever type of exams there are, students will have corresponding study plans, and in the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The university highly values the suggestions from students and has already deployed a rectification plan across the whole school.
Requiring teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations for self-inspection, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problems of single question type and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examination affairs need to face, and of course corresponding systems need to be introduced. However, the effort lies in daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the exam will be more in line with reality, thus allowing "scholars" and "dunces" to get what they deserve.
If it is not possible to change my store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?

The colleague's orders have been sent out.

Mrs. Kim's Bridal Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have any branches.
Before taking the photos, as we had not arranged the time properly, we changed the time twice and our consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us to arrange the time.
Later, they chose a nice weekend to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I had ever put on makeup formally, wow~ I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking photos, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if anything was slightly off they would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after a day of taking pictures.
When selecting photos, because I had seen many cases online, I was unwilling to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were selecting photos, really, there was no intention to add any photos, just the 24 photos in the package, not one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos around the same time, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right, and they immediately helped me to fix them again.
When I compared the photos my sister took before to ours, I was really satisfied with ours. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Mrs. Xuanhan to take wedding photos!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for your sincere wishes for your happiness and bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper.
The Sabah National Registration Department has said that since the beginning of October, due to the stock of special anti-counterfeit paper running out, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns, with a cumulative total of 3200 people affected so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Keralamunis, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and would receive their replacements when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of the Sabah newspaper's paper printing problem that had been reported for a period of 10 months by a web media.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kalu Amunis revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two working days (December 20).
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From seven-thirty until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they are ready.

Super convenient, just like opening on a computer, it solved my problem of insufficient hard disk space on my computer.
The newly arrived solid-state mobile hard drive cannot be read by the mobile solid-state hard drive computer, and the mobile solid-state hard drive computer does not recognize it, but the computer can read it with a USB drive.
The machine is easy to handle, with a grand and beautiful appearance.
Today it was used for an afternoon and it cooled very well, barely feeling hot to the touch, running quickly and booting up faster than 99% of users.

The item was good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave a backpack, which I thought was great.
The shop service was also good, reminding me to update the bios and issuing the invoice promptly.
Well done!
Heat dissipation: Very good heat dissipation, almost no heat; Lightweight: Easy to carry; Appearance material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfactory.
Reputable sellers should carefully inspect the overall appearance of the machine, all interfaces, and make sure there are no signs of refurbishment or used traces, to ensure that it is indeed a brand new US version with the same configuration as the page.

Educational News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High School in 2016 - Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Middle School Admission Examination for Special Talents was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of special talent students, making the competition for special talent students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the overall proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students this year does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted to school does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have special talents in sports, art, and science and who apply online are eligible to take part in the special talent admissions examination.
To facilitate students to take the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, for a total of 13 examination sites.
Examination points are divided into examination areas, with time periods divided by hours. Students will be examined on the same day according to the time period, entering the examination point in different examination areas.
On May 23rd, the District Education Enrollment Examination Center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check their examination results online.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control at port cities, with a 48-hour nucleic acid test negative and a "buffer period" set.
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border ports (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to land border ports to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities may study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the responsible person from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing differentiated management policies by region, from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve an earlier containment of the epidemic, compress the risk of spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items at each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, in order to quickly make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice stressed that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publish and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the potential risks of basic living materials supply and prices, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities where they are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Xinhua News Uncovers the Truth of US Military's Bloodthirsty Slaughter for 20 Years Through YouTube Videos
Video source: YouTube
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years of bloodshed and slaughter of the innocent.
The misuse of drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian places, distorts humanity and sets up killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
Each act of inhumanity has stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "war on terror" has become a "war of terror."
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover together the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Upon seeing the following article, which discusses why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, even though canning is a deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, the following words may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder factories and got to know many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a can is two years or longer?
Or one might ask: why is there such a big price difference between the tinned and bagged versions?
In fact, many consumers, or "mom-level" people, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, with this mentality, eat and then react saying that the taste or flavor of the packaged product is not the same!
Now I will explain to everyone why hearing aids are expensive, where does the expense come from?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Because manufacturers take into account that if the bagged pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in their pricing of listening devices to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for bulk packaging rather than bag packaging.
With so many manufacturers spending millions, even billions, of dollars on advertising each year, where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So with the development of society, the costs of market promotion, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening devices, and their prices are also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose was to gain higher profits, even though the cost of their raw materials would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary and link up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
Chinese related laws absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, and in fact this kind of practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that, under the premise of having a can at home, buying bagged milk powder and putting it into the can can save money while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, making it completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out too.
Immediately cancelling, the things he had sent from #PRS_ORG# must have gone cold.
I haven't got it!
#NAME# said that none of you went to get it.

Can I get a refund if I cancel my order?
How do I pay the rider for their service?

Don't be intimidated at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of success-oriented books.
Many of the successful textbooks of today preach the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, skipping over the actually most important and fundamental step of "how to do it."
As a result, these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do the best you can, or don't do anything at all; either 100% or 0%; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best principle," which anyone who looks at it would acknowledge as "absolutely correct," but 99% of people would be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly a case of self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to rules and resists change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word "transformation," unable to make a decision and take action; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and take the first step bravely, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for a while and give up, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid representation of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principles" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limits of ordinary people, leaving most people "sighing at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is the only way to get more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a great victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than staying in the same place.
In short, it is always better to do something than to do nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes a greater chance of success.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is only slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second-best principle" is able to effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 71,000 Tons This Year - Xinhua News
The latest monitoring results show that the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year to 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002, according to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Khuangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale hunting, the degradation of the environment of the spawning water of the naked carp, and other factors, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage".
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag to put it in and it was cold outside.
Is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Wondering if it was lost in transit or if someone took it, thanks.
It has been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about examples of lies, it was too long.
Giving a science lesson to the uninitiated male.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly one day between the ages of 13-15, and will go through menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, it will come regularly every month, provided that the body is in good health.
But it's not regular enough to be able to predict accurately, with a margin of about a week, so preparation is needed in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to be earlier than expected by several days.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of cramping vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; cramps can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with 24 hours of bleeding for a few days from start to finish, and the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen when the menstrual period just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but it won't be of much help if the cramps have already started.
Before the menstrual period, diarrhea is easily caused by excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release.
If it's around the time of your period, if you have stomach cramps for no reason, your period will usually come within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is changing it 6 times a day, which is 42 pieces a month. If you add the extra ones you prepared, it could be up to 50 pieces, not just one piece a month.
It is not necessary to change the sanitary pad frequently; it can be changed every five or six hours, at most eight hours.
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the fluctuating hormones during ovulation can make one's moods unstable, making it a bit of a bummer when the body trips itself up.
But official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and would not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Fluid is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is at its thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus being a house, building it (the endometrium thickening) each month to prepare for guests, and if no guests come, it is all taken down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, with bleeding for several days and 24 hours a month for decades, as well as abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But a person is able to be born because his/her mother has had menstrual cycles, which are to prepare the house for you to stay in for 10 months when you first come into this world, so everyone should be thankful to their mother for having regular and healthy menstrual cycles.
Many things for women were previously suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that it was dirty, shameful, and that it was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and finds the preparation of a female body for the creation of life disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well should not be so ungrateful and not know their place. How can they face their own mothers with this attitude and how can they think of their own children?
Finally, the sisters tried the sanitary cotton swabs and they really worked well.
Today is the Winter Solstice, so sending the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.

Is the tingling sensation when soaking feet in a foot bath caused by an electric leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide range of products have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great deal of choice.
In terms of related data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and to his surprise, it lit up, indicating that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, who was quite accommodating, but despite the refund of the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt disgruntled.
Because he found that the long-standing foot bath was not subject to any clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature settings, who it was suitable for, and what materials were safe to use.
Generally, foot baths do not have any electrical issues, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been released without proper inspection.
Therefore, choose a freestanding foot bath when purchasing.
The separation of electricity and water poses no safety risks.
You can also take a digital pen test at the same time.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Today morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Professor Liu Zhonghua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering solemnly introduced: The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the trillion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, and driving the income of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Newhua celebrated the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition, the Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
New-style red tea, infused with the connotations of tea culture, is popular and in high demand, and the Hunan tea industry is welcoming a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the term "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "The superior part is called the Way, and the inferior part is called the instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the "Book of Changes", and was translated by Inoue Tetsujiro (Meiji era) from "metaphysic".
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical basis that all phenomena can be explained by concepts of natural reasons was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolutionary theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any reference to God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and studies about human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behaviour accepted by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong actions).
It studies what kind of moral behaviour people should follow), applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the standpoint of preconceived theory, but by investigating the actual moral agent's real choices made and observed, all the moral factors that prompt these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by people such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.

Ding Zilin: To Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our family members, especially since I first issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It was your act of kindness that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the novel coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease giving humanitarian donations to the group of Tiananmen Mothers, as this humanitarian relief effort should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in their 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Federation and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often fail to reach the hands of the victims of the June Fourth Incident.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which was executed for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor and Elderly Special Assistance Fund," which has been executed to this day.
The funding for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations from the year of the Tiananmen Square incident, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Square incident.
During this time, China Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4th donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as plentiful as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those brave comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Thank you Rabbit for your feedback. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your approval, Dan Dan, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great - I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production was impeccable.
The makeup artist is especially meticulous, and will match a suitable makeup for you according to your style, using only top-brand cosmetics.
As for Teacher Liang, photography is quite his specialty.
The whole studio had an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats playing and accompanying.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague had their photos taken in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, they thought it was just so-so.
He specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not very good at managing our facial expressions, feeling that this is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
A team of makeup artists, photographers, and post-production designers.
When the film was finished, we and the people around us were all full of praise.
My friend had been recommended to me and she was just as delighted when she saw the negatives.
It is hoped that such studios will not be buried, that more people will discover them and take out their own style instead of being uniform.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhenying and Jingling. Both are very creative newcomers with great ideas. As a creative studio, we will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results of the shoot were much better than I expected. Thank you everyone for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the feedback, Little Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust has been a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you all. I hope I can come back to Qinhuangdao to play next time.
How do I give money?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their personal experiences.
If one is intending to enter this industry, it is possible to choose to find a place for training, but if there is no such idea, it is better to learn by oneself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it also takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to teach yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if the faculty strength is not strong enough, then the training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions have not particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, I actually don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given any introduction to your own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with the individual's own situation.
For example, factors such as profession, age, language to be learnt, and even which city, all have a bearing on what you are studying or wish to pursue as a career.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays there are many offline and online training institutions which are also very good, but one has a high learning cost, two requires a lot of time input, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet for free, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not have to be too hard, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now have employment agreements, internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
These are my thoughts, as I said before I don't know your situation so I can't give a detailed introduction, if you have any other questions you can contact me anytime for further communication.
I said 1 o'clock before, I saw it all in the app.
What is meant by
What are you doing while I'm still talking?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance) services, such as wall-mounted stoves, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me likes, I will continue to strive hard for life even though it is tiring.
Life will not disappoint those who strive for it, so follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life - others only see the results, while we have to go through the process alone. In the face of life, all we can do is be strong and keep going - there is no other choice. We can look back on the road we have taken, but we cannot go back.
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the fatigue is worth it, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services helps you achieve "clean" to the best of my ability, serving the family with love.
Keep the family clean, set up a family governance monument, serve in place, and clean up the family.
Cleaning indoors and outdoors, my daily work.
Just like a crystal lamp, although it is gorgeous, if it is not cleaned for a long time it will become dull and lose its light. Only after cleaning can it shine again, and the same is true for life.
We take our stitching seriously, with care and attention to detail to create something beautiful.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is to be trusted, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any field nowadays!
But I always believed that as long as I had a serious attitude, persisted, and worked hard, I would be better than others, at least better than just sitting around complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health, and good luck. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When young, happiness is something to possess; when grown up, happiness is a goal to reach; when mature, it is discovered that happiness is a state of mind to understand.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life brightly until old age!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia have joined forces to hold the first Saudi contemporary art biennial - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennial - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on the 11th at Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is jointly curated by the Saudi Art Council and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River," which is a metaphor for the reform strategies taken during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This biennial exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters, with galleries spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling Our Way Across the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Thinking at the Edges," "Towards the Public," "A Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly regarded, some of them using recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Streams and Mountains" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Mr. Buckley, stated that he hopes the Biennial will be able to establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences the opportunity to understand the vibrant cultural industries and creative communities of Saudi Arabia, and to strengthen the interaction between them.
Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennial is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help promote rural revitalization comprehensively.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare positions, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of post development settings, the new regulations clearly stipulate that posts should be set up in accordance with the principles of "setting posts according to needs, assigning personnel according to posts, dynamic management, and overall control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-job training and arrangement for work.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.

Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I am placing an order again.
Has it been cancelled?
Although the rightists had their moments of success in history, they were not long-lasting; they would shine in a bit of sunshine and sweat in a sip of water; they would be ambitious when they had some success, and would be defeated and flee when they were attacked.
But to be fair, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
As for me, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I take his words seriously and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes social issues in China seriously.
But I opposed his anti-communist theory, believing that anti-necessity revolution would inevitably lead to social unrest, harm the people's livelihood, political groups would be mixed up, and foreign powers would take advantage of the situation.
To change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people; those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in fact, was a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right is to have any positive meaning for society, then the left is deprived of it, since the left wants precisely what the communists have thrown away as dross!
Recently I have seen some friends arguing with anti-revolutionaries while getting angry, which I think is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a madman; they are both unreasonable and cannot be reasoned with.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think of getting the opponents and the left-wingers to admit it - why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent piece and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them so obsessively that they become fanatical.
As ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually becomes a villain.
Generally speaking, when referring to left and right, China, due to its historical and cultural innate genes, should be leaning to the left as a whole.
Whereas the right-wing domestically emphasised freedom, efficiency and development, the left-wing strengthened regulation, focusing more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole is hoping for more fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is a given, and is likely to continue for many years to come.
Even though I don't understand it, a like is all it takes.
Without saying anything else, Hua Hua is just so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to simultaneously blockade China's chip industry, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and reduced production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phones increasing in price, and almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to gain control of the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing US tech giants, such as Intel, an old American tech giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter,"
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent team and technical reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Intel's decision was met with disdain by TSMC founder Morris Chang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement, and without any hesitation, he said that Intel's investment in building a wafer factory was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the semiconductor field was due to his lingering resentment towards Intel from a feud over 30 years ago with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the global semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chips designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model put a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs had to back away from the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
TSMC targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing," providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognised that Intel at the time was looking down on wafer processing services.
Surprisingly, the giants who once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel had entered the semiconductor foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not an easy task.
I'm not waiting any longer.
I've been waiting for two hours since I placed the order at 7:06.
Let's take a look at some of the "weirdest trending topics" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot searches: "Dragon Raising its Head on February 2nd," "Lay's Price Increase," and "Hualala Incident," public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [indexed downwards] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump appearing again.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China has previously displayed.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event presents a "solitary peak," "sawtooth," and "cliff" shape.
The "peak" is when it is artificially heated up and quickly rushes to the top of the hot search list, causing public attention; the "sawtooth" is when it is heated up periodically to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; the "cliff" is when the collective retreats, the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on a new task and rush to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no difference in time, which must be a unified batch of water soldiers receiving the task and launching a new offensive.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in the dozens of hot searches that appear on the list at the same time: which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones incite wars, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones stir up emotions, which ones influence decisions, and black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, taking into account almost all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Public relations is a science, and without taking into account any subjective factors such as position or emotion, it will be impossible to hide from objective data.
Everyone leaves a trace behind them, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries first discovered cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain - Xinhua News.
The Xinhua News Agency reported from its overseas correspondents on December 12th that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported cases of infection with the new variant of the coronavirus, the Omikron strain, for the first time.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron Rho strain of the infection on the 10th day.
According to Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November, while the other is a local resident who tested positive for the virus on 30 November after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being treated in hospital isolation, the two infected persons' nucleic acid tests both turned negative and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cypriot Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the virus.
These three people are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month and, as they were all mild cases, were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government of Sei is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 and over arriving by plane into Saei must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
The health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found three cases of infection.

Grand Me 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, 156 Huan Cheng Nan Road
Initially I chose to come and take a look because of a friend's introduction and trust, and my initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as he arrived in the store, he began a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even go to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, and they roughly showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam was that you would be dragged into the store and asked to pay a deposit (which you would never be able to get back unless you had enough experience to fight them in court).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big pitfall, and I am a living example of being scammed; in a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service charges are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything at first.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special little team to deal with me.
No matter what, the client's problem will be bitten off and they are completely blameless.
There are various excuses and many details that I don't want to mention one by one, all of which are tears. In short, don't choose them because my friend's house that they renovated also has poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn it, they were the original scamming ringleaders, now they've changed their name to something fancy, and it looks like they've gone out of business again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decorating company.
Later, when choosing, everyone should Baidu and consult these because decoration is not a small amount of money.
Please log in or register to ask a question to the merchant.
Posting of any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited; please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then, if the money isn't refunded within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes or less.
The salted chicken should have been cooked, but the raw meat received was inedible.
The night sky will be graced with the Perseid meteor shower on the 14th, with a peak of activity expected.
According to an expert in astronomical popularization from Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin, the Geminids, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
Amateur astronomers in Beijing captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13th, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of flow, and is together with the Quadrantids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower known as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant at the zenith) of 150.
The Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression with its "falling petals," but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered with by moonlight, reducing its spectacle somewhat.
On the 14th, the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright, which will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight after the moon has set, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, but rather to choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a clear view towards the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait until after the moon sets to observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there is no need to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful shots of meteor showers should choose a wide angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and continuity, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential.
Xu Li Ping reminded us.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
From my understanding, the traditional television the poster is referring to should be a LCD television, and the difference in market positioning between laser televisions and LCD televisions mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales for 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Zhongyi Kang, the sales of laser TVs in 2020 will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The success of laser TVs in the big screen market is mainly due to their excellent performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The CESTI-Zariski Laboratory of the China Electronic Standardization Institute and the ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison experiment of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health is becoming increasingly important, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but have also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to liquid crystal television prices that are continuously dropping, the prices of laser televisions currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to producing less heat and causing less wear and tear on equipment, televisions also have a longer lifespan.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
Not to mention pseudo-demands, but the product of demand segmentation, the quality of the painting and the input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, after weighing, you can judge for yourself, just afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projection - laser television, in order to be close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which did not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fyner screens, though expensive, can cost the same as a 65-inch LCD for an 80-inch one.
Also, I particularly hate it when projection vendors use "diffused light is better for the eyes" as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Even LCD TVs are "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it will not be able to form an image.
It was precisely the hot spot (glare) effect of the high gain screen that was overlooked, where a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes at certain angles, that was really uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetic Photography Gallery has not yet opened any branches, but offers quality products online.
After adding her on WeChat to book a date, the lady sent me a list of available times and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many different styles of photography.
After the day arrived, I had a simple conversation with the Miss and she patiently helped me try on two sets of the styles I was struggling with, and finally decided to start the makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props before shooting, guide the action, and be very meticulous about each detail.
But since we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style wasn't what I wanted, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style, which feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to fix the patch, so just wait and see the results~
I won the second prize in the photography category of the all-you-can-eat event~ most of the clothes in the venue could be chosen for shooting.
She finally chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting was the younger brother of the 95-year-old. He felt a bit inexperienced, and hoped to give more advice on customer shooting actions in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores for reply.
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too!
I went to the store, filled out my name and phone number, and then chose my clothing. I could choose wedding dresses too. I tried on three or four sets of clothing and the staff was very patient. After choosing, I had my makeup done for a long time and the service attitude was good. Later, they taught me how to pose for the shoot. The only downside was that the photos made my face look big. They said it would take half a month to edit the photos, but I received them in three or four days. It felt like there was no difference between the edited photos and the original ones.
The overall environment is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup positions, inside of which is the photography studio.
The service is both friendly and attentive.
The sculptor is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the poses very seriously.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to suggest a reshoot.
The experience was a bit too much, as the originally double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
Having the ends of the eyebrows shaved off was a bit embarrassing for daily life without eyebrows.
The photos were given in about ten days, but the photoshopped effect was not very satisfactory, feeling that the double eyelids were still very obvious.
After trying two different styles, not being sure which one to go for, the young lady eventually chose the black dress, saying that it was more of a Hepburn-esque vintage style.
After picking out my clothes, I started to get my hair and makeup done. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me, and the end result was very satisfactory.
After getting my hair and makeup done, we started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was easy and harmonious.
After shooting was finished, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and the editor said he could finish the film within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfying.
It has been 3 days without a response... I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan as your system is unable to recognise my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015)," to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million for establishment, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite strict, summarised as having the strength, being approved by the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) for regulating insurance companies and banks, having good style shareholders, and as an insurance broker, the insured does not need to question too much whether the umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it is good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest launched He Tai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claim party and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still pretty good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism in the insurance industry, this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance telemarketing for "Tencent Weibao" (an internet insurance brokerage platform, like Little Rain Umbrella) and was very responsible in informing people.
The insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but what is not reliable are the people; there are no professional practitioners on the internet channel, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the minor, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
The insurance company paid out six million dollars as if it was only one dollar (the world is full of surprises).
The free mobile phone is only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - the free 60,000 RMB critical illness coverage is short-term, and if there are no other commercial insurances, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 RMB won't be enough to solve the problem and life will start to become bare.
Currently, states are also cracking down on the mis-selling of internet insurance.
So, in conclusion, the platform is not an issue, the product is not an issue, the issue is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully, in fact many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an insurance broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for them. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers be worry-free.
Growing with each customer for life.
I hope my answer will be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although there is not much of a "ceremony" to buying insurance online, and even possibly no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat akin to a "telephone sales" assembly line approach, can have a fatal flaw when it comes to buying insurance, namely - follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, so when we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider if the "intermediary" we have chosen is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us even many years later?
How can I get in touch with the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider just left it at the door and then walked away.
He also made mistakes.
Your rider has picked up my takeout order at #NUMBER# but I am still being told it is waiting.
The delivery rider had received my takeout by 19:25, but still refused to depart.
Do I need to get anything else for takeout after I finish buying?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Do we have to wait?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel it, I'll call the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

All you need to do is redeem the discount code.
No problem, remember no need to arrange for a reshipment, I have already purchased another one, don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and cursing, and I cannot accept any behavior of personal attacks.
In a civilised society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we set aside party and faction, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you began sending Facebook friend requests, to posting sarcastic posts, to trying to post my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but also continued to talk about me on Facebook with your so-called friends in an unrestrained manner, with some subtle, humiliating comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed, etc. I... just forget it.
Later I was informed by several friends that you had posted a photo of yourself on your Facebook account along with comments containing sexual harassment elements.
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news report of the police call was uploaded, you did not show any restraint at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are only caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your chart or continue to make all the offensive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my looks and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said yes, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I have cut off some of the comments for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you with the posts you make yourself.
All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization.
A smile of satisfaction.
Vietnam News Network - Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and after the pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has seen a large number of digital products cultivated, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam, with many digital products having gone abroad and Vietnam's digital technology ranking having improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take on the responsibility of developing the country's digital transformation platform, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is taking on the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared their mobilization and gathering of all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and put forward and solve breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery such as Huihui.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasised in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the only way forward for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for everyone, so it is necessary to mobilize everyone to participate.
People and businesses are the core, subject, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasised that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, with internal forces as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believed that digital transformation should be driven towards deep development and sustainability, participating in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, responding to subsequent changes, overcoming the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and helping green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and practices, and to promote digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the nation increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has called for increased leadership and guidance from all levels of government, institutions and enterprises in the development of digital technology, improved understanding of digital transformation, continued formulation and improvement of systems for digital transformation, and strengthened national management, all while promoting the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Vietnam Made" Outstanding Digital Product Awards Ceremony and the opening of the "Vietnam Made" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported it and attached pictures, but there has been no response.

Are you sure the food is freshly cooked and not old?
Unacceptable.
The order was placed early.
It will be delivered around 7 o'clock.
Why remake it?
That's outrageous.
The 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit "Intelligence Xiangxi" opened - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online

Address: No. 555, Gaotie North Road, View Map
Here, there is a wide selection of home appliances and electronics, with many brands and all the well-known brands.
On December 12th, go to the "Hanson" water filter store to check out the water filters, as there is an ongoing activity with discounted prices.
There are a total of 11 floors at Home Depot, from -2 to 9, with -1 and -2 being parking spots, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings were not very good, with few restaurants and hardware stores, and the restaurants had average tastes.
This elevator was also very speechless, just like a big illness, going back and forth between the negative two and negative one, no matter which floor I pressed, it was also very speechless, directly connected to a furniture store, the furniture store closed, and the safety passage couldn't get out!
Home Depot still needs to be improved, with many areas still undeveloped.
The address is 555 North High-Speed Rail Road, Sha-yi-ba-ke District, with convenient transportation and a large parking lot, which is free during the day.
The environment: To be honest, the store is huge, with 8-9 floors, and you can buy furniture, home appliances, and all kinds of small things... There are many famous brands in the store, such as Mushi, Oppo, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchuangzhijia, Hansdun, Yak, Youbang, Silian, Fupinju, Wanjiale, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan... There are too many brands, I can only remember so many. It is a good place to buy products, and you can sit on the sofa and rest when you are tired.
Recently I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friend said there were many sofas to choose from. I looked at GJ Home Furnishing and Meikemei Home, and they felt okay, but the prices were a bit expensive, so I'm still in a dilemma.
The public comment Urumqi home store channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as Gaotie home address, telephone, business hours, etc. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to the public comment.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area - Xinhua News Agency.
On December 11th, Xinhua News Agency reported from Wuhan (reporter Wang Xian) that the Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was listed for operation on the 8th.
Thus far, the water-based green comprehensive service zones have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by the majority of the crew and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and the ability to receive ship pollutants and provide shipping services has been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and crew, helping to solve the "urgent distress" problem of the crew.
The two water green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, realizing the "one-time berthing and multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
According to the latest satellite images, three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform," on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic stronghold in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy the "Carl Vinson" to the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, currently cruising in the Pacific, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also carried the first F-35C squadron, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stokdall".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
On January 17, 2022, US Navy carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flew a route around China, visiting Guam with the strongest weapons rarely seen.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence.
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying twenty Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China for a rare visit to Guam, the strongest weapon in the region. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy has assembled its three aircraft carriers around China, making a rare visit to Guam with its most powerful weapons. China has been building a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rumbling Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the "Boomer" the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad," which also includes launch silos for ballistic missiles located on US soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
When talking to friends about the recent 26% drop of Meta and the evaporation of its $251 billion market value, Zuckerberg responded that they are facing "unprecedented competition." What is the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue primarily coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, whatever their functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance," with many apps connecting to Meta's advertising platform to achieve monetization.
But times have changed.
Firstly, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether they allow an app to access their information, and most people's normal reaction would certainly be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it is certainly present).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, Meta receives at least 10% of its income from China, mainly from companies doing business overseas.
Meta has offices in Hong Kong with approximately hundreds of people, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets find that Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money being spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance just two years ago.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it specifically recently, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new channels of traffic has been unsuccessful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets not only look at income, but more importantly, at expectations of the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The metaverse should certainly be one of the directions of the future, but the realization of the metaverse has a longer cycle, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of between $100 and $200 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at Facebook, with no real safe haven compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms.
Although his social media apps now have high daily active users and are mainstream, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand unified universe was so far out of reach that success in the short term was completely out of the question, making Facebook a very risky venture. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues was wrong and was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
