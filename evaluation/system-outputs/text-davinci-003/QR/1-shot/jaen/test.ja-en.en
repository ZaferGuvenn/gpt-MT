When I tried to purchase an entry package, two packages appeared, one blue and one orange.
The price is more than double for the orange one.
What is the difference?
I couldn't find out by researching, so please tell me.
It should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They look different but they are the same.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who would be stronger if two people with the same height and weight fought?

Generally, karate only practices sparring with each other, not fighting.
Because Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in particular, is practiced with the inclusion of dealing with strikes.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation for Durandal being thrown out of Thalia?

With things like that around, I don't even feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the comedian was forced to do something? Television is all about comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
Even though it's obviously not funny, it's creepy when people laugh at everything a popular comedian says just because they're popular.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood, and it won't be pleasant to work with them.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is like a sports club, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a normal unpleasant attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the hard work of their job by saying "Don't belittle comedians" one by one.
I know that the income is quite low until it becomes popular, but even if I'm told that it's a difficult job to stand at the top of the peak like a comedian, it's still not easy.
It sounds like a justification for comedians and beautifying their own careers and for their positions being too high in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the things related to the entertainment industry are becoming more and more unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from the Tsutaya Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper, and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Even though it's not really about custom PCs, I'm having trouble with online shopping and I can't make sense of it, so I'm posting here since it's a well-known place.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked Fish Tak) so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order confirmation email and the next day I received the shipping confirmation email.
In both of these emails and in my purchase history on my page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here's the problem, I got an email a few hours after shipping saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email
They were selling the wireless version at a discounted sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse, so...
Reject receipt and cancel all.
Return the mouse only for a refund.
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response.
It seems that the product page is divided into wired and wireless versions, and although it is written as wireless in the purchase history, email, and delivery note, it was sent as wired without permission.
Isn't it unfair that they sent the wrong item without my consent and asked me to return it if I want a refund without paying for the return shipping?
Please lend me your wisdom as I would like to retaliate in some way even if I accept the refund in the end.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the typhoon and heavy rain was washed away, and the residents tripled their stockpiled food <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto in Takachiho Hara District, Yamafuri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a big impact on living with three households of eight people.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was going to be broken so quickly and washed away," said the only road connecting the Takahigahara district, the Takahigahara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
Residents who were forced to go without water had to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to the public, to transport the necessary supplies every day.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually I can come to the garden by car, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry it or carry it and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge, which was completed one month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the isolated state was restored for several days until the temporary bridge was installed.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
I was thinking that I would like to secure at least two to three days worth of food, so I stocked up about three times more than before the disaster for canned food and cup noodles that can be used for emergency food.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "Since you don't know when a disaster will strike you, I felt again that it would be better for everyone to have some supplies. On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yatsumi Town Education Department, Takahashi Ryuichi Director: "We have established it as "Yatsumi Town Disaster Prevention Day" and we have also announced that we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards.
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

The test itself is almost finished, so all that's left is to write the essay, but we are also doing a follow-up test to make sure the measurements are correct, so please wait a little bit.

Experience the ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course of the Paralympic Games.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of tourism in Tokyo through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were provided, and people who visited the venue were running on a simulated Paralympic marathon course in a virtual space with dedicated equipment.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing participants from both inside and outside the country to experience a marathon-like competition while running the course together, and also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
Participants said, "The scenery was so different and so much fun!"
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough while running but it's really fun to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best until the end while competing with everyone," said the city official. "We want to make sure that people can enjoy it in sports gyms as well," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

The Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system has been set up to revitalize the used housing market, and used housing transactions are doing well.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
With the increase in people staying at home due to the coronavirus, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", and this has likely been affected by the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a building condition survey, called an inspection, for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate Transaction Business Act (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system where an architect who is knowledgeable in housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, giving the buyer a sense of security.
Ultimately, it can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system where they can understand the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase and be able to purchase with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for building condition surveys is mainly the seller.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the system of inspection was made obligatory.
In other words, real estate agents who are in charge of intermediation have the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where risks are concerned with seller-led inspections.
Before the purchase of a house, there is a system in which the buyer requests a building inspection from experts called "Inspectors" or "Building Surveyors".
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of the used home transactions, depending on the state.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, to sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey contents and thinking of making appropriate repairs so that they can live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the intentions and desires of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection survey mandated by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
There is a risk of overlooking really important issues due to the lack of detailed investigation ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility of an inspection being carried out with "leniency" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

It was quite tough.
I was mentally healed, so I was full of motivation.
I used to be a researcher and sometimes I would fall asleep during work because I couldn't keep up with my body.
Since it was the second time in a year, I thought of taking a break for a month and parting ways with the crappy company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it dragged on for a long time.
In any case, it is important to go to a psychiatric clinic and get the proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits (very important).
If you have a medical history, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the doctor's judgment at the Hello Work, so the hurdle to receive unemployment insurance etc. will be drastically lowered.
Even if you can't find a job, even if you want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

As you walk through Ginza, you can see the traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious monuments, and numerous shrines scattered around.
We were walking around Ginza and suddenly the silence that visited us said, "This used to be a peninsula."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza, the synonym for the bustling streets that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" was a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryogae-machi", but when it moved to Ginza it became known as the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area around Ginza was a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza, and a bay called "Iri-guchi" extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Kiyomasa developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
And they dug a moat, cut down the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a monument of "Ginza Origin Place" indicating the site of the former Ginza Office, so why not look for it if you are interested.
A "pilgrimage" to Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Ginza Hachimangu Meguri" pilgrimage, known only to those in the know, is held in Ginza.
Out of more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryukou Fudouson" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and "Ginza Dempeshi Jizouzon" is on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Takadono Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
Inarisha, which is greeted by a fox in front of the company's main hall, was built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, believing that there would be benefits of "five grains and abundant harvests" where the rice grows well.
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it is said that there are benefits of business prosperity, and in Ginza, the most prosperous city in Japan, faith spread.

I went to the dentist because two days ago I started to feel a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to get rid of the pain quickly.
Before the treatment, I feel a sharp pain when I touch my teeth, will it get better in a few days?
The painkillers don't work at all...
It will take a few days to settle down.
I think it hurts the most right now.
Take care.

Let's write about something good that happened recently.
Since it was Corona, it became fun to drink a lot of alcohol at home without meeting anyone.

Recruiting: How to Compile Scripts & How to Modify Existing MOD Scripts
I looked around a lot and tried my best, but I still can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that so I can start from MO2 without running scripts or resources, but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorials, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the scripts of an existing MOD and recompile it... why can't I find out how to do that...?

Body of a man found in Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoji River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to 110.
A man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died on the spot.
The police are quickly verifying the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disarray in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are quickly verifying identities and investigating the circumstances at the time.

South Korea's Posco International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expands overseas gas field business - Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, Posco International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition process is expected to be completed in March next year, with the remaining procedures such as approval of resolutions at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of local corporations.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy 49.9%.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas will divide the market with green hydrogen, leading to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operational personnel in Australia.

That knee pain, could it be "osteoarthritis"?!
Different Treatment Methods (Medical DOC) Depending on the Cause - Yahoo! News
Editor's Desk: I have been having knee pain lately.
What are the possibilities of any illnesses?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be various, such as injury, arthritis, gout attack, etc.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial: Does this mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smooth.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, joints of the fingers of the hand, neck, waist, thumb of the foot, hip joint, etc. can also occur.
However, the most common is the case of knee onset, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: So what kind of structure is a joint made of in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint consists of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where the two bones meet is covered with articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editorial: So it has a complex structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Inside the joint capsule there is a tissue called synovium which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movements smoother, which is why.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushioning role, isn't it?
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash, I sleep in a tracksuit or something!
Are there people who can quit smoking cigarettes, and people who can't quit smoking cigarettes?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but he quit completely.
He said he was thinking of stopping, and then he just stopped without doing anything.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" which boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where lives are at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tingle... ... Take on the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to examine the Kaiji games that can actually be played or practiced in planning videos.
Swamp The pachinko machine "Swamp" featured in "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji" is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaizi was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Emono", and "3-Step Cruun" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Beam Crossing" was a debtors' game, including Kaiji, that was held as a pastime by the wealthy at the "Star Side Party".
The debtors proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participate, with the top two able to win a prize, but there are only four iron beams and inadequate safety measures, making the risk of death quite high.
This steel bridge is highly dangerous, but it can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are provided ahead, and you have to walk there.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kojiro became a topic of conversation when he released a video of himself walking the Eagle Bridge on his own YouTube channel, saying "You can experience the Iron Bridge in Japan".
E-Card is a two-player card game.
Play with 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into Emperor side and Slave side.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
After a hard-fought battle, Kaiji realized that his ears were being read by a device that destroyed his ears like attached earphones, which sensed and transmitted changes in pulse and body temperature. He then confused Rinkai-gawa by shaving his ears to the extreme and making his body abnormal, and won the victory.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing against actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, using an E-Card, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaizi feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a feeling of having experienced it.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the New Year, gently pushing forward - Tora's great votive horse at the Prefectural Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
At Yamagata Prefectural Koku Shrine, where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive horse of the zodiac animal of next year, "Tora (Tiger)", has appeared.
On the 11th, students from the Tohoku University of Art and Technology who designed it visited the shrine and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to paint the ema since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the students of the Japanese painting course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suehara Toshiaki, the work of Yuichi Tsuchiya (22) was adopted.
The large O-mikoshi is 3.3 meters wide and the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping by, the sight of the deer admiring the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, we can still have the luxury of appreciating the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya's designs are also featured on the ema generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonengyi said, "I think it will be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's Think About "Living in Tamano" - A Proposal for a City-Wide High School Student Workshop: San-Digital Yomiuri Shimbun
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Creation Center", we will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor.
What makes it fun?
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer out loud such as "when having fun with many people" and "when drumming".
The first meeting was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" using the "World Cafe" method, where each person moves to a "island" with a predetermined theme.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting that there are many young people in the town." "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points, and let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it's attractive that you can cycle along the seaside," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
Binan High School third-year students (18) talked with adults about not only the regional issues but also the attractions, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be surrounded by nature."
The second meeting in December will be attended by high school students only, to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the education director to make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the East Council of the same center said, "We hope to foster a sense of attachment to the hometown among high school students, and to provide an opportunity for young people to actively participate in town development."
Magnitude 5.0 earthquake with intensity 4 in Kanto region, epicenter in southern Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News

According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture and the depth of the epicenter was about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0 on the Richter scale.
There is no concern about a tsunami.
The seismic intensity is as follows in each area.
Areas with a seismic intensity of 4 include Yuki, Kasama-Ishii (Ibaraki), Ashikaga Taisho, Tochigi Nishi-Hou (Tochigi), Kiryu Motosuku (Gunma), and Ota Nishi-Honmachi (Saitama), among others.

How to Find the New Way to Roll a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Scarves are essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves has a long side of approximately one meter, giving it a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is like a net pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, you can wind it up without connecting the ends.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (vests) are popular, but many people will combine them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting!
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed movie.
It feels like a raw, life-size Beatles, with a variety of freshness...
We're on the brink of breaking up so there's tension, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying hard to keep things in order, there was Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying but come on!" attitude, George, who was grumbling with a "but see~" tone, John, who was saying his opinions and jokes calmly but was always late and lacked motivation, and then there was Ringo, who was playing the role of the peacemaker but wasn't really actively participating, and was just sitting in the back with a "oh, this is troublesome" face.
We don't hate each other enough to fight, but there's a very common feeling that "it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting that the Beatles had the same kind of feeling, like a legendary breakdown or something.
And in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a few phrases and then gradually building up to a famous song while asking each other "How about this?" is amazing.
The moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually turns into a Zucha♪ Zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics come in is firmly recorded, it's amazing.
It's rare to be able to see the process of composition like this, so it's amazing.
Of course, everyone is greased up, so just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three, but so far my impression is that the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
Even though the four of them bickered, they seemed to have fun when they started making music, but when it came to the topic of where to have their live performance, people like producers and promoters started talking in a "The Beatles are the best in the world!" kind of way, and it was easy to see that they had taken the reins away from the members themselves.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it was the reason why there were so many scenes with Paul being quite villainous.

Do not call out the technique name before performing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and your heart has been getting more and more strained.
I guess it's hard to live a little bit now, isn't it?
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I found that I'm really suited for sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it became much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, my life will become a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and relax before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there is a company union or an industrial doctor or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there because there may be some system.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes ravage the US with unprecedented damage due to unseasonably warm and cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From Friday night to Saturday, there were multiple tornadoes in the southern United States, according to local time.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth for this time of year caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperatures on Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time are expected to reach near 30°C.
Due to the strong cold air coming down from around 5500m above the ground, which had been in a record-breaking warm state, a vigorous frontal system was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind in just 10 days (Friday) local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached the third strongest level out of six, with instantaneous gusts of wind of around 70 m/s.
Future surveys may also determine it to be an EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita Scale and adapted to the condition of buildings in Japan.
This JEF3, equivalent to the tornado in the US this time, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan as well, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

Under the "biggest in history" debris from the US dragon roll, voices asking for help were broadcast live (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his views on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by CNN TV and other US media outlets.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can".
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of fatalities could exceed 100.
Photo: Residents carrying household items such as furniture from a damaged house in Kentucky, which was affected by a tornado From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
The record of a 219-mile (about 350 km) damage caused by a tornado in 1925 in Missouri and other states remains, but a meteorologist from CNN estimated that this time it was the largest scale of about 250 miles (about 400 km).
In the hard-hit town of Mayfield, Kentucky, the candle factory that was operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas rush also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were employed, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
A woman, trapped under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick in the darkness, felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above the rubble, and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In the broadcasted live stream, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, there were also the sounds of "Happy Birthday To You" seemingly sung by another woman crying in an attempt to distract from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
He looked back and said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the ground."
The police officers of the Mayfield City Police Department said that the search operations will continue until they are no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, at least six deaths have been confirmed after a warehouse of internet retail giant Amazon collapsed.
The train derailed due to the shock of being detached from its carriages, and the expressways were also blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What can I do to make more?

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be great if there were lodging jobs like inns and resorts that could provide both an address and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus crisis.
I did a quick search and it looks like there is this website↓,
Live-in Part-time/Full-time Jobs - Live-in Job Navi (Sumina-bi)
There is a related search for "bargain live-in work", so it seems like there are a lot of colleagues like that.
With bank accounts and line contracts, it seems like it can be done with just an address for the first time, but with credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update them without an address (since a new card is sent to the registered address).

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
It is argued that while other countries deduct points from a 5-star rating system, Japan takes a 3-star rating as neutral and adds or subtracts points from there.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings of "there are points to be deducted" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If you base it on five stars, "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, it would be a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used and such operations are not being done, I understand that you would like not to give three stars (bad reviews).
So when people try to argue against those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a two-choice evaluation on Steam, the conversation doesn't fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can take a standard hose size and be powered by USB?
The power capacity from USB is about 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
Depending on the water pump, it will consume at least 500W, so it is impossible.
The numbers are vastly different.

Making a Radio Coil
I made an AM radio with my own condenser and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right?
So here's the thing, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like I'm getting an FM radio instead.
Why do you think so? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
Mods that use ESP for distributing textures and meshes don't need ESP if they are deployed as loose files in the appropriate location.
I remember seeing something about it somewhere, but I can't remember where...
I understand the risks, so I'm not planning to actually do it, but I'm worried and can only sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, I would like to be told if it is okay to do.
Thank you for your post.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" "Freshly Fried Fish and Shrimp Fried with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Living / Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento Box "Freshly-caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune", a take-out specialty store for colorful bento boxes and deli (souzai) dishes made with plenty of vegetables.
"We opened in August last year so that people can enjoy the restaurant atmosphere even at home," said Takayuki Kousaku (39) and Yumi (38) couple.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of the moment at the market.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, "Fry is made with thin coating of raw bread crumbs so that you can feel the texture of the ingredients," and you can directly feel the crispy texture of the shrimp fry.
Bento boxes come with four kinds of side dishes, portioned Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the nearby fields' homegrown produce and from the prefectural direct sales outlets.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as raps and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that provides a "familiar and comfortable taste" (Yumi-san) like rolled omelette, which can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
The bento box "Hand-kneaded domestic beef hamburger" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, which are processed meats to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
Ride comfort It's not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Naturally slow speed.
Safety I think it's safe because it slows down and sometimes even stops completely when there are people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
Uncomfortable with the stares of people around me; it's good to be seen but it feels like they're intruding, it hurts my heart.
Overall, it was not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if there were considerations such as having them move to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be best to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with people walking around.
I thought it was a great ride because I could relax and take in the scenery at a leisurely pace, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a thrilling ride with a futuristic feeling of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings, which is quite difficult for those who are not very patient.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but this bowl of rice doesn't use any eel at all.
Actually, it's "Nas!" (Tap to get the correct answer)!
I like eel, but I thought that everyone was just eating it with sauce and that anything other than the grilling was fine, but then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I didn't want the eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Sprinkled with sansho pepper instead of scallions).
I just fried the steamed ones in a pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for a simple dish.

A Family's Long Journey to Establish Environmental Protection Activities at the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
Kato Yuuki, Corporate Consultant of Find Asia in Hong Kong: China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection by local governments, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Yunnan Province in Southwest China, such as Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna), is also one of such regions.
My sister Li Wanda is currently an actress. The Sipsongpanna region is located on the border between Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group, which shares its roots with the Thai Kingdom.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Xishuangbanna covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Li Min-guo in Seesapanna and hear about his environmental protection activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection campaign "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and has come to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted a number of biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest took place in order to root industry in the area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met a journalist I knew and got married.
Before that, did Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li I am from Cesar Panna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
So I had to push the project forward with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who don't have a particularly attractive face or tall stature, but have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said,
Aura is not something that you can just put out.
It is something that naturally comes out when you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong inner confidence.
High-performance and high-quality rubber boots are handmade by craftsmen.

Isn't it detailed?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I don't quite understand what you mean since I have never been told to praise in detail.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
"My heart is blooming with Sakura's confession, I'll accept and start going out with her," I replied.
And to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.

[Omakan/Personal Note] It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-circuit environment.
During the period until March, there were multiple CTDs due to various factors, and since I couldn't play much around the GW period, I felt it took a long time to identify them mainly on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash logs.
Main CTD Timing
No trace is left in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework, .dll plug-ins of the logging type.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activated even with console kill → Improved with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
Camera work when activating kill moves against some NPCs → Basic improvement by setting OFF the kill move setting by PC via .ini: Competition of settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Mainly outdoors) Field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID usage NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all OFF with 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Could this be caused by additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although the 2.0 SPID default.ini has a formatting mistake, it should still result in the intended outcome and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
Initially, I focused heavily on checking motion/combat mods (.dlls) related to body part attacks and OnHit, and this is the result I got.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French language levels.
If there were any people in a Japanese environment who had the same CTD problems, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it just in case.
Everyone is doing it with a pretty tight mental state.
Nobody around notices it, not even colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that the person looks very troubled but still works hard.
He is probably on the brink of mental exhaustion as well.
I haven't officially retired for mental reasons, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - After today's visit nursing is finished.
I have been suffering from bipolar disorder for a long time and have been receiving home nursing care, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We have conversations about different topics every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply impressed with how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication through today's home visit nursing.
Today we had a discussion, or rather a gender debate, about the differences between men and women.
In home nursing visits, we also talk about topics such as male and female sexuality, or why she got divorced, etc.
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that when a visiting nurse with a work therapy specialist comes, they are given orders from above with an attitude of "this is a medical facility", etc.
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really good, as they face me on an equal footing and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric visiting nursing care, and there may be people who are considering receiving it.
Visiting nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, please take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from my side because they just didn't fit together.
Sorry for the poor writing.
I know it's a false alarm, but it came out in English and I was scared.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what it will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japanese Version) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced its Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
It was stated that by 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be popularized (cumulative) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, the target level of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's performance of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap is significantly below the target value.
On the 12th, the Japan Association of Economic and Social Organizations (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions conveyed that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower in the competitive countries."
The country-by-country patent rankings are China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1,033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) to rank fourth, but it was only at 22% of China's (4,721).
The All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large amount of investment and research and development expenses deductible from the tax amount."

I think it would be difficult if you don't have an address other than day payment.

It is important to sleep in a futon, and simply having a bank account or a debit card, or receiving government services, requires an address.
Living allowance should be able to be obtained without an address, but it would be a rare case.

Do you get paid for volunteering activities?

Was the number of female wives from Meiji to Showa much smaller compared to now?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common to say the phrase "sister-in-law wife" in the streets.
And, since it was said in the old days that "even if you wear a golden straw sandal, look for a wife who is one year older," it seems that there were more wives who were older than now in the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime to sell items at a higher price than the regular price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
As it is free competition, for example, if the brand item increases its scarcity value more than the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high prices of PS5 are due to its rarity value and the value has increased from the original price.

TV program-style flyer creation Takasu, with the progress of the Diet reform, the "communication book" of the members of the Diet: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition
The Town Council of Takaesu is working on unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "mailbook" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform about the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th, 1800 new leaflets were distributed by newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Giron from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Exploration Series" ... .
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy phrases reminiscent of popular TV show titles.
Hyoe Katayama, the 43-year-old lawmaker created, said, "I want you to come to the Diet with a smile on your face."

US Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engage in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12th.
Military aid is equivalent to a total of $60 million (about 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars and other weapons will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of troops carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance over Russian military movements, and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response in case Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the provision of weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st of this year.
Military aid from the United States to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula by force, the total amount of aid has exceeded 25 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions with the Ukrainian military.
Last month, state troops from the US state of Florida were dispatched in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hand" of lifetime gifts, direct hit to former Tax Commission Chairman Masaki Amari of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is called "Advance Gift and Rush Inheritance".
While discussions on the integration of inheritance and gift taxes are progressing, the proposed tax reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year was not included, but there is a high possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become "forbidden" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, together with a direct hit to Member of the House of Representatives, Amari Akira, will impart everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques that can be completed by the end of the year.
(Edited by the Diamond Editorial Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
From wealthy people to city employees, "forbidden hands" are used for lifetime gifts. "From the perspective of taxing both inheritance tax and gift tax in an integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer."
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what it is trying to say is that it will increase inheritance tax by changing the rules of inheritance and prohibiting "gifts before death", which is the main way to take inheritance tax measures.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property".
The strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although the outline of the tax system reform for fiscal year 2022 announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, was not adopted, the policy towards integration was re-announced with more detailed wording such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed within the limit".
In an interview with the editorial department, former Tax System Research Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and former Secretary General Kanemaru said.
It is most important to avoid the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of asset transfers, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from (integration) and the fastest amendment will leave three chances for the remaining lifetime gifts.
Even without that, it seems unlikely that in the near future, a big step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift taxes change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
Photo: Kanon Yamaya as the heroine The story, based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Shoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamayu Kajun.
University student Riso meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kaili, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has similar features to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to a certain incident?
Yuudai Furukawa Comment Drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who were unable to watch FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already watched it, I think you can get to know this work more deeply by seeing the complex psychological description of Kairi and Risou, and the changes of the two people who are in conflict.
We are happy if even fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

The team that won with three passes in one game - How did the players feel and what did they do? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was only a few times since 1974 in Week 3 when the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets, the fewest in the NFL over the past 50 years.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2000 yards for the first time in the history of the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the running of Simpson and another RB, Jim Brown.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, with the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18m, and it was snowing before the game.
Since Bills is local, he didn't change his play selection much.
Pass 30 times versus Run 25 times.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was never incompetent.
There were four red zone penetrations in the ten offensive series and there were scoring machines.
Especially in the late third quarter, it advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only scored three points in one of the three FGs.
Goal-line defense in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, chasing four points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
18 yards to go until the goal.
At 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, the outside right Ace WR Stephon Digs ran a shallow cross and seemed to be free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in a failed attempt.
Brian was covering Bills WR Call Beasley man-to-man, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw a pass twice targeting the end zone.
The fourth down pass may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on third down.
Get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had made it to 4th and Short, Allen's own run ability should have come alive.

It's time to replace the items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time - here are three picks from Harper's BAZAAR (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News.
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably not recommended to change it as often as a sponge.
According to research in 2017, it is known that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that cutting boards should be replaced when they start to become worn out, with scratches and grooves.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, as bacteria can proliferate.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, and pat dry with a clean paper towel or air dry.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be painful to get rid of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also be the cause of chapped lips and spilled drinks in the missing parts.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Did you read the article at the link properly after quoting from the beginning of the article?
Community markets and trade are two different things.
At the community market, you can use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been scammed out of items without being paid.
That won't happen.
Trading is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different conversation?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even in simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even in intellectual labor.
Help, my FlashBIOS won't finish!
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen became black with a white cursor-like dot that was not blinking and stayed there.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it won't take an hour either.
Possible causes may be an old USB memory stick or an SD card converted for use.
Have I overslept and gone crazy?
Could there be any other similar causes?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I knew someone there.
He always had a baggy-eyed look.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand name items.
You can bring inconspicuous items, but you cannot bring things like Louis Vuitton with monogrammed logos and the letters "LV" written on them.
Why is that?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it would be nice if it were in Japan.
In Japan, it is ....
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
I'd better say it sooner rather than later, "Why do you only call me by my first name/talk to me in a familiar way?"
If it comes to the point where it doesn't matter if you're a foreigner, it's best to simply say it's unpleasant.
I don't think I ever dreamed of having an uncomfortable feeling with a somewhat decent probability.
I was living overseas for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people there, and I think they misunderstood that they could say whatever they wanted to the locals.
If it looks like a Westerner, I don't think there is any malice, it's more like a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling.
My friends from Europe and the US call each other by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, I sometimes get a bit confused about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's with friends.
It's probably just normal to do it purely, but if you overlook it, it might be difficult to stop the exceptional treatment as if it's a gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Is it possible to talk according to the rules of Japan because it is Japan?
Study: My white friend who is naturalizing has a habit of always raising his glass higher than the younger ones at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but it's a good habit because I'm treated like a Japanese person, without being strangely treated by people younger or older than me.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are so meticulous that there are a lot of people (including me) who look at those small details.

Although precision sniping is not possible, if the site is set up with accuracy (if it is sighted in and zeroed), it should be able to hit the target fairly well.
Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and saw that this newly created sub had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, there were only 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
If anyone who subscribed to this sub today could tell us in the comments where they heard about this sub, that would be greatly appreciated! (I have no idea so I'm really curious!)
Since there is only one person making threads right now, it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could make threads as well.
Even without creating a thread, your comments will be encouraging.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
People who are using Twitter, please feel free to start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The sub-group I made before didn't gather people as I expected and I gave up soon, but this time I can continue without giving up thanks to everyone.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules, and make the sub-room easier to use, so please continue to support us!

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in the sentence, but I understand what is trying to be conveyed and it is at a level where it won't be an issue to play (I just feel this way, it would be better to ask others as well).
Translation of this level is often seen in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, it feels well translated.
I think it takes a long time of studying for non-native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

The analysis is that training in "Demon Slayer" is the battle.
"Effort Equivalent Exchange" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Launch Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the amount of training it features.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles and training is done both day and night, is not popular among readers.
It can also be inferred from the fact that in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates separated, there was a two-year training, but it was only touched upon and the rest was skipped over in a grandiose manner.
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of the eccentricity of the land it walks, but "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled down to Tomioka Giyu, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his life, and was told by Giyu, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are only forced down by the powerful... ... .
While saying that, Ginu introduced Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains the applicants of the Demon Slayer Corps, as a kindness of his (although he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intention).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate someone?", to which Rengoku was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied with a single punch, "You're too slow to decide".
It's a conversation piece among fans, seemingly an unfair exchange at first glance.
However, taking my sister who has become a demon with me carries the possibility that I may be forced to make such a judgement at some point.
It could be said that this is an initiation into practice from a mental attitude.
Rin Tatsumi, who has not yet trained, takes Tanjiro to the narrow fog mountain and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, pitfalls, throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like you will die before you enter the training.
Still, with his sharp sense of smell, he can barely detect the faint smell of the trap set by humans and somehow manage to avoid it, which is called the "protagonist correction".
Even so, it seems that the essence of Demon Slayer is to make Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so physically capable that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is just being able to use one's original potential with the power and skills they have honed up until then.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", which rewards those who have worked hard and nothing to those who have not, is a human hymn that differs from the supernatural power of the baseless Oni, and is a difficult rule that is consistently applied in this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping without a bed, directly on the floor with a futon, a quilt, and a comforter.
Since the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Shall we go?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fit my idea of "stingy", does it?
I think of "gemetui" as a strategy to get more benefits than just doing something with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has established a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into a set division, named DX (Device eXperience), the company announced on the 12th that it will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly launched DX division, which integrates the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as Visual Display (VD), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, Mobile eXperience (MX), and Network.
Samsung Electronics officials explained that the name change reflects the company's mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs, were also emphasized to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience with ease.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies on a company-wide scale, crossing organizational boundaries, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the Common Era?
How would you say that in Japanese?
This was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for non-Christians, the idea has been that it should be written as BCE in recent years.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

I remember seeing it because I supported it on Kickstarter and was in the process of localizing it into Japanese.
Although there are preferences, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a low-voiced male narrator.
I would like a more heavy and formal expression.
They lie in wait, their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible above the sand... anything that falls into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey, showing only their disc-shaped head from the sand.
This feels a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, so they can catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about is
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Looking at it from an ant's perspective?
Is that so?
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular heads" would make the part "in ant scale, it is a giant beast wearing a helmet" disappear...
Aichi 24-vehicle collision, truck driver has no preexisting condition, carelessness suspected (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, had no underlying illness and was likely to have caused the accident due to some carelessness.
At 10am on the 10th, 24 vehicles such as trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people suffering minor injuries.
The police arrested Katsuyasu Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing an initial collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of the Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness and it was found that some carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises and investigating the situation in detail.

"Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to its focus on only one battle!
"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In short, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, the mutual tug-of-war competition and special training scenes are quite different from before, and it doesn't lead to the match, but it's never boring.
The tension of the beginning of the century-long war gradually increases in the work, and this feeling is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and I am amazed that even this period is a calculated production.
And before the important finals, there is one more mountain that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Besides the luxuriousness of the match card, what I like is the scene before the match where Ramenman is pointing to the Kinnikuman poster and saying "Now it's my turn to take charge!!"
Trying to bash the chop.
However, a passing Terryman caught the sword and stopped it, staring silently, and the scene ended with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a fuss about this Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
As a manga artist, I still feel the impact of this scene where the characters come to life!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight was the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
Don't underestimate the power of divine luck for Kinnikuman!
That's the phrase.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers have been subtly feeling that Kinnikuman will ultimately win because he is the protagonist, even if he doesn't win by strength.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei had already preemptively driven home the point that this hand was no longer usable.
With this one sentence, the reader is thinking, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman is going to beat Robin with his own strength?"
How do I do it?
It will stimulate our imagination with an unpredictable development, and from the perspective of a writer, this is like a line of dialogue that the author has imposed on himself to create the work.
Wow, you did an amazing thing.
I'm sure this is one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aobayama in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illuminations that began on November 26th are decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along with a promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture were surprised to find such a place when they came to Fukui after a long time.
She was saying it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event with a button pot performance and a movie screening.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power for the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened~
Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
After a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for now.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
Not starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up for a moment and the fan starts to move but stops immediately.
After that, he said nothing.
Even when I unplug the power plug and try again, it still only lights up for a moment.
I tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, and removing all other parts, but it still won't boot up.
Fans of PSU have heard a buzzing sound before, so I'm suspicious that it might be caused by the PSU and not something else.
I'll try to find an extra ATX power supply and give it a try later.
Maybe.
What if it doesn't work out...what should I do?
Should I change the case and the mother together?
Have you seen wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?
Where did you see it?
Is it surrounded by nature?
I live in the Tohoku region.
There are places everywhere near my house.
It is also in the garden and company parking lot.

On the contrary, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are extremely rare.
I want it to stay true to that style.
Thirty more new coronavirus cases in the military...all breakthrough infections = South Korea (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
