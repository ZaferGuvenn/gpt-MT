The reason I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has stated reasons for his departure from the PDP to the APC.
If we remember correctly, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, defected from the PDP to the APC this week.
He said that in order to stay in the good graces of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi state and help the poor to win the 2019 election, he had to gather and leave the party to return to the APC.
The main reason I left Bauchi state was because of the PDP's rule.
Everyone knows the role I played in the gubernatorial election which the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, won against the incumbent Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now there is corruption and bribery in the government of Bala.
Instead of staying in the PDP, they gave me what I deserved and told me to go back to where I came from.
Dependence wrote a resignation letter from the PDP which he sent to the male leader of the party, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he reminded the other governors where they had failed and where they should have done better, but Bala was not negligent.
Let me go and let them be.
A fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire started around 10 pm and took almost two hours to put out, despite the efforts of the Kano State Fire Service, security personnel and members of the community who went to the scene.
When Freedom Radio visited the site, they found people in distress and various security personnel there and there, as the site was connected to the major highway known as Kuka Highway, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and neighboring countries of Nigeria.
In addition to the Kofar Ruwa market in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio interviewed some eyewitnesses who said that the chaos had caused fear and distress among the public.
A motorway service station at Kofar Ruwa said they had collaborated with security personnel to evacuate passengers who had become distressed due to the flooding.
The Kano State Fire Service has confirmed the incident, stating that at the time of this report they are still collecting information to identify the cause and the extent of the damage caused by the fire, as stated by the agency's spokesperson Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, reports indicate that some robbers attempted to break into the Kofar Ruwa market to commit theft, but police and security personnel attempted to repel them and protect the public's property.
We contacted the Kano State Police Command spokesperson, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
CORONAVIRUS: We have not yet completed the testing of the vaccine developed in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to conduct trials for the efficacy of the Coronavirus vaccine, Nigeria is not left behind in its involvement in conducting its own trials.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 coronavirus remedies submitted by traditional medicine practitioners.
Commissioner Mojisola Adeyeye announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that tests are done to ensure the quality of medicines so that people don't get harmed when seeking relief.
Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, traditional medicine practitioners have intensified their research to ensure they are not left behind in finding a cure for the disease.
Many of them submitted their medicine to the government for testing and verification of its authenticity.
Furthermore, NAFDAC imposed certain regulations and guidelines for them to follow when producing the medicine.
The safety of the drugs will be tested on animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned the healers not to recklessly administer any medication without permission from the authorities.
In May, NAFDAC announced that news of people claiming to have discovered a traditional cure for Coronavirus can only be seen on social media and newspaper websites.
Adeyeye has stated that only one person has challenged the NAFDAC to verify the authenticity of the medicine he claimed to be of traditional origin, and that it could cure Coronavirus.
That other person too, it wasn't a cure he said he had discovered, but rather a way to manage the illness.
He said he had discovered the remedy for the symptoms of ill health which were thought to be signs of infection.
However, since then, some healers have been challenging the authority of their union.
Ramaphosa faced questions in the legislature.
This is the first time President Ramaphosa has faced questions from parliament since allegations of corruption and bribery between senior government officials and members of his party surfaced.
Ramaphosa has promised to strengthen research and bring improvements in the area responsible for procuring weapons against the Covid-19 virus.
South Africa has become the fifth country in the world to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president has said that corruption and mismanagement have played an important role in fighting the disease in the country.
On Saturday Nigeria will open its first international airport.
Nigerian authorities have announced that they will open airports for outbound and inbound flights from Saturday onwards, for the first time in five months of closure.
On March 23rd, the government of the country suspended the entry and exit of aircrafts due to the spread of the coronavirus.
The government has said that the first four planes to arrive from foreign countries will begin to land in the capital city of Abuja.
It's to Lagos, but so far it hasn't been revealed from where these planes will come.
According to the Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika, the decision to open this was based on the lack of any issues since the resumption of domestic flights on July 8th.
He added that all necessary protocols must be followed to ensure the successful return of the aircrafts.
591 New Cases of COVID-19 Have Been Reported in Nigeria.
On Friday, 591 new people were found to have contracted COVID-19.
With this new number of people infected with Covid-19 in the country, the total number of infected has reached 39,539, 16,559 have recovered and 845 have died.
The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has provided the number of people and states on its Twitter page.
We have been getting more cases of Corona in our group - Marseille.
The football club Marseille in France has announced that three more players have tested positive for the coronavirus, after five people were found to have it last week.
The group announced this in a statement released to the media today Tuesday.
Additionally, the league announced that the start of the French League 1 season, scheduled for last Friday, was postponed due to five players testing positive for COVID-19.
Marseille has also announced to the stakeholders of the League 1 tournament that they have had an increase of three people infected with the virus after the first five cases, in order to find a solution to the situation.
APC Accuses Governor Neja Of Attempting To Introduce Faction In The Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released yesterday, the APC party accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring division within the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, stated that in the six years the party has been in power in the state, only Naira 512 million has been received.
The document went on to say that the meeting convened by the governor, which was chaired on Monday last week, would help to bring harmony to the party, where they said they had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Imam Engineering, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the youth of the party by organizing a water and fire meeting, which is not in accordance with the rules, in order to address any complaints against the party leaders, they should be written to the party secretary for investigation".
He continued that to date, in the six years since the party was founded, N512 million has been in the party's account.
He said what he understood as governor was to be part of the national reconciliation committee set up on July 25, 2020, which the president had appointed to lead the preparation of the issues between the two parties and to resolve the disputes between the two parties in court.
He said that the money we received was used to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries, and for other activities related to the party, such as organizing rallies and resolving some of the party's problems such as lack of access to government subsidies, and that no party funds were spent without proper authorization, and that we are challenging anyone to bring us evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I have mentioned, the elections of the local governments in the previous state were the most important elections held in the country, which we conducted together with the former governors and the current governors of all the twenty-five local governments, and the funds spent on the elections were allocated to the governors to bring their constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent without any rules, this is almost an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name in order to discredit it, saying that there is no committee that has been set up to investigate how the party funds are being spent and who set it up.
Among the funds that the complainant alleged were misappropriated, the funds provided by the national party treasurer, not any other funds, so I challenge any evidence that he has brought to support this allegation in any way.
The Imam said that we should stand firmly to defend the APC party from any attempt by any individual or group to undermine the party, and he added that any allegation against the party or any leader of the party from the state level should be referred to the disciplinary committee as provided for in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) of page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the members of the party have no real influence, especially if they attempt to take control of the committee, so their decisions have no effect.
Therefore, they are the duly elected officers of the party in the state, as provided in Section 21 and Paragraph 6 of Section 87 of the party's constitution, and anything contrary to this shall not be used.
Because the ruling to sever ties with the rulers was a mistake.
He said that those who presented themselves and agreed yesterday at the meeting which did not improve, including Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The approval committee for the water and sanitation party president Engineer Mohammed Imam will be the only one to lead it, not the governor will lead the party leaders of the state.
The document further noted that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello reminded that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the election, of traveling with the party parents in government so that everyone will benefit from the state and all constituencies through the provision of political positions, is the challenge of the governor and the party.
The resolution commending the federal legislators who did not attend the meeting and calling for reconciliation of all the issues between the party members was not surprising to the legislators who were aware of their own guilt and unwilling to accept fraud as a party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the state's ruling committee to draw Governor Abubakar Sani Bello's attention to the appropriate stance to avoid attempting to disrupt the politics of the state.
Nigeria is at the forefront of Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, has said that the country is ready to take the lead in the digital economy.
She also said that the government is making preparations step by step with experts from universities and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is kept up to date with modern technology in all areas.
Dr. Isa Ali Fantami articulated this at an international conference on the advancement of communication technology held via the internet.
The minister also added that one of the first steps the government has taken to ensure that the country is benefiting from the communication technology is to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communication to the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy Promotion through Internet.
How food spoilage affects the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating food that has been treated with preservatives, arguing that consuming such food can be detrimental to one's health.
The experts issued this warning after conducting a study on the quality of food consumed in this country.
The research showed that there are some foods that are fortified with nutrients to prevent them from spoiling.
The research also showed that this material was used in rituals, such as the sale of fish to the public in the town of Alabo and Busasshhen.
The symbolism is used so that when someone sees it, they will be interested in using it.
Then, food containing this substance can cause animal diseases, fever, heartburn and other ailments.
People in this country are being called upon to pay attention to avoiding the use of these kinds of food for the sake of their health.
If we remember, food technologist Grace Olasumbo called on Nigerians to avoid eating fruits ripened with the chemical Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used fertilizer by traders to fertilize crops, namely fruits and vegetables.
Research has shown that patience and perseverance are among the factors that make traders use this resource to show their goods in a day.
Olasumbo has pointed out that something that traders often overlook is the use of this ingredient to demonstrate the safety of their herbal products to the public.
Therefore, we can be exposed to diseases such as malaria, conjunctivitis, dysentery, typhoid fever, cough, flu and other illnesses.
The African Union's President of the Bank was cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The High Level Panel chaired by former Irish President Mary Robinson has cleared African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina of all charges.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the charges leveled against him.
The news agency AFP reported that at the beginning of this year, a report of fifteen pages accused Mr. Adesina of sixty of favoritism, mismanagement and self-enrichment.
However, the committee of experts led by Robinson, along with Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and the Deputy Managing Director of the World Bank's Governance and Anti-Corruption Unit Leonard McCarthy, cleared the former Nigerian Minister of all charges against him.
Previously, the United States had imposed a requirement for an investigation into Mr. Adesina following a whistle-blower complaint by the African Development Bank, prompting the establishment of a committee of experts to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.
COVID-19 Has Prevented Trump's Re-Election Rally in Florida.
Yesterday, Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he was cancelling the major Republican convention planned to give him the nomination ticket in Jacksonville, Florida, in the coming weeks, due to the increasing cases of coronavirus.
Nevertheless, the major conference will be held in the state of North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it was not appropriate to hold a large gathering at this time.
President Trump moved a portion of the GOP convention to Florida last month after clashing with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the convention in an indoor venue without requiring face masks for attendees and supporters.
A few representatives of the Republican party will be gathering in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially nominate Trump on August 24th.
Trump said he would make an acceptance speech in a different format.
Trump, who has spent months expressing concern about the impact of the pandemic, recently said that 99 percent of the cases seen in the US have been mild, and that there is no cause for alarm.
Buhari Will Not Accept Greetings of Salah.
The Presidential Adviser on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, announced this in a statement issued by the Presidency today, Wednesday.
The announcement also stated that the President would not accept visitors at home who usually come to greet him on Eid.
The Sheikh said this measure was taken as a result of advice received from the Islamic Council to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus.
President Muhammadu Buhari has also reiterated the measures recommended by the assembly to avoid overcrowding of people in one place.
For this year's Eid al-Fitr celebration, the leader performed his prayer at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he usually does every year.

Achieving Food Security for the Welfare of the People - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the essence of life for all creatures, and no life can exist without food.
This is why the Chinese authorities are increasing their efforts to ensure the security and food supply of the people of the country.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in food security, a feat that has amazed the world given the country's population estimated to be 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has greatly helped the cause of global hunger relief, as the head of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Zhang Wufeng has previously stated that since 1949 to the present, China has always placed the issue of hunger relief at the forefront of all its national policies.
But in recent days, some people and some media outlets in the western world have again "expressed concern" about whether China can lead the world in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic?
We are deeply grateful for their constant care for the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved the goal of providing sufficient food through its efforts.
Providing food for the Chinese is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS, and the President of China, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that any food waste is a result of hard work.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruption to the world has caused hardship to China's economy, China is still able to provide sufficient food for its people.
The statistics released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics regarding the amount of grain, particularly rice, that the country will obtain in 2020 show that the amount of rice obtained in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2019.
Professor Ke Bingsheng, the former president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, also said that China has achieved great successes in terms of national wealth and food security compared to the early days of implementing the reform and opening-up policy at home.
Huang Jikun, director of the Institute of Agricultural Policy and Strategy at Peking University, told a representative of "The China Science Daily" in an interview that the severe challenge China is facing now is whether in the next two or three years, China can reduce the amount of grain and cotton stored in warehouses.
Now the amount of food each person receives is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms each person in the world should receive each year.
Now China is importing millions of tons of agricultural products just for domestic animal feed.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should divert their attention, either by taking a nap, or by focusing on the affairs of their own country.
The Chinese are able to sustain themselves with the food they produce themselves.
The reason for the arraignment of Ganduje before Justice Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Abba Kabir Yusuf, the PDP gubernatorial candidate for Kano, has stated his reasons for prosecuting Kano Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some businessmen before the High Court.
Abba Kabir was reported to have done so, by his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who said he filed the suit, accusing the ownership of some market buildings which the government and people of Kano State benefit from.
In addition to the Kano government and the market people, Abba Kabir Yusuf also sued the state ministry of works, housing, inter-state transport, the Kano state attorney general and the state land bureau.
Sheikh Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State government of seizing some ancestral lands of the former Daula dynasty, which are now under the care of the Wudil Science and Technology University and the Shahuci airstrip, claiming that this violates the laws of the country.
Father only agrees, to the system of rotation in 2023.
President Muhammadu Buhari's Chief of Staff, Mamman Daura, has stated that the patchwork of governance in Nigeria has become the norm now, rather than the exception.
Mamman Daura has said that Nigeria has already done enough groundwork and should now focus on selecting the most suitable candidate for the 2023 elections.
BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he revealed this.
This system of rotation of the presidency in Nigeria has not produced a lasting solution since it was first implemented in 1999.
Instead, Daura said to focus on finding the right person rather than following this system of patronage.
However, the Igbo people, the Inyamirai, have challenged Daura on this statement.
It is said that he and his brother President Buhari had to struggle for power through bargaining before he could come out now and give advice against doing the same in 2023.
Buhari himself was not chosen above all Nigerians.
The senior security officers of this country who have been sitting in their positions for many years have not been removed, and they are not more capable than the others.
Comparison of Inyamirai.
A political storm erupted in Nigeria on Wednesday, as the Igbo Zalla Preservation Group, Ndigbo, condemned the statement of the Nigerian presidency against the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, the son of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a zoning system will be used in the 2023 presidential election.
Thus, his words did not go unnoticed on social media, Igbo people quickly released a statement to Mamman Daura, calling him out for his divisive rhetoric.
In a statement issued on Wednesday by the Igbo ethnic group in the South East and South-South regions, they declared that they will be allowed to produce the president in the 2023 election, that is, the Igbo ethnic group.
The Spokesperson of the Igbo Zalla Tribal Union, Emeka Attamah, has stated that Mamman Daura's words are like a declaration of his candidacy for the Nigerian presidency in 2023 for the Igbo people.
Besides silence, what has prevented Mamman Daura from speaking out since 2019?
They have removed Jonathan and now Daura is making a southern coalition that will lead Nigeria in the 2023 election.
After he finishes sorting out the legacy left by his late predecessor, he will come up with an unknown agenda for the 2023 elections.
As a traveler, he should embrace truth and hold it firmly.
He is not running for the presidency of this country in 2023, but rather running to show love and compassion.
VOA Discussion Forum on Rape.
The issue of violence against women and children through rape has become a hot topic in Northern Nigeria where reports have emerged showing the violation of children's rights.
People from various sides attended the meeting on July 23rd to discuss how the situation was worsening in the country and how to resolve it.
The forum participants linked the problem to issues such as the pressure put on young girls and the strictness of some parents.
One of the mothers who attended Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu's meeting, the widow of the former governor of Plateau and Niger states during the late General Sani Abacha's regime, described poverty as one of the reasons why parents impose restrictions on their children.
Hajiya Maryam, the mother of Nasir, the leader of a movement to combat this epidemic, said "First of all, we must educate parents about the dangers of letting their children go out, because only when a child goes out will they be exposed to harm".
We also call on religious leaders to start preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who commit rape against their children and wards.
The Honorable Shehu Mohammad, the Member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse in Kebbi State, expressed his concern and support for the enactment of a stringent law to punish anyone found guilty of rape in the country.
At the end of the meeting, Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who led the session, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of the Voice of America for accepting their invitation.
The Northern Media Writers' Contribution to Northern Unity.
Modern communication platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, and others have long been playing a major role in creating channels of dialogue, connection, and unity between different communities around the world, as well as sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational, and commercial agendas.
Nigerian youth have embraced this new technology of social media to travel the modern world, to give them a voice or to express their opinion on matters that affect their lives.
We can say that these initiatives have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economics, education and politics of the region.
Many are now eating, writing, sending messages online, finding jobs, or developing the activities they are engaged in.
Unfortunately, instead of using this opportunity to gain progress, some young people have chosen to follow the path of the disadvantaged children of this country, fleeing the world, within and outside the country, or writing slanderous articles and insulting government officials and elders.
What is indicative of the lack of opportunities for the youth of this country is present.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers in this country is a great blessing, providing Northern youth with a good platform and a clean environment to engage in social media, so that they can write meaningful articles and promote the goals of the Northern people.
It is necessary for us to give this organization the support it needs to achieve its noble objectives, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region but to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially those using social media, to come together to protect the North and its rights, and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.
Our northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Premier of the North Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their contemporaries had a vision to provide for the people of the North.
It is said that the late great fighter against injustice and oppression, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows their own home!
Therefore, we say that, as we call for the advancement of the nation and the improvement of the governance system, at every step, we call for the unity of the North, without any religious or tribal discrimination, to bring progress to our region.
If we consider how the North used to be compared to how it is now.
Therefore, we should use the wisdom that God has given us to provide the North with a sustainable path to economic prosperity and development.
The North should provide sources of revenue to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide funds.
If we want to progress in the North, we must give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health, science and technology.
We don't have to give money to help out, there are other ways to do it.
We can see how the North will fulfill our leaders' ambitions!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated 126 billion naira for the renovation of hospitals in the country.
The federal government has allocated 126 billion naira from its economic improvement plans to renovate hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be renovated include FMC, testing centers for diseases, emergency care units, isolation wards for contagious diseases, and teaching hospitals in the 36 states of the country.
In past years, health experts have called on government agencies to join hands in allocating funds to improve the nation's health sector.
Experts made this call at a meeting to get consensus on providing quality and accessible healthcare to people in Abuja.
In his speech at the APC Northern Kwara Senatorial District Primaries, Sadiq Umar said that the Nigerian government should prioritize the improvement of the nation's health care system.
He said that not doing so has caused the sector to suffer from financial problems, which has caused it to rely heavily on the aid it receives from foreign countries.
Umar said that despite the support they were receiving, there was no visible effort from the government in the health sector, which led them to start withdrawing the support they were giving.

The number of people who will die from hunger in Africa will surpass those killed by Coronavirus - IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has reported that an additional 23 million people are at risk of hunger in the countries of the Sahel region of Africa in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made this statement at the World Economic Forum's Panel on Economic Resilience.
The meeting discussed the issue of Food Supply Chains in Africa during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Houngbo said that research, forecasts and assessments of the food crisis showed that in 2020, the number of people who will die from hunger in Africa will exceed the number of those killed by the Coronavirus, by far.
IFAD is a renowned organization that supports people living in rural areas by promoting agriculture, providing them with nutritious food and generating income for them through farming.
Houngbo said that Coronavirus has highlighted the urgent need for reform of the food system, its distribution and its sustainability.
Many farmers are struggling to get access to modern technology due to travel restrictions.
Furthermore, they could not go to the fields and those who farmed the produce for sale, the markets were closed so they could not sell their produce.
The report further states that in 2019, 135 million people were affected by hunger worldwide, with 73 million of them coming from 36 countries in Africa.
In Nigeria, hunger killed over 5 million people in 2019.
NNPC Received N378.42 Million From Gas In June.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has reported that the revenue generated from the export of crude oil and gas in June was N378.42 million, compared to N133.16 million in May this year.
The Nigerian oil company added that this is an additional tax revenue that has been generated since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, which has caused the imposition of travel restrictions and the collapse of oil prices in the global market.
In a statement by the company's Head of Public Relations, Dr. Kennie Obateru, the NNPC declared that, within the period, the NNPC had increased its revenue from crude oil and gas sales to N4.60 trillion between June 2019 and June 2020.
The company reported that it had generated a total of 378.42 million dollars from oil and gas exports to foreign countries in June 2020, and 133.16 million dollars in May 2020.
As the company previously reported, it received a total of 230.65 million dollars from oil sales, while it received a total of 75.97 million dollars and 71.80 million dollars in other revenues.
The financial report that the company issued in June 2020 was the 59th report that the company has published every year.
The report showed that between June 2019 and June 2020, there were net inflows of 4.60 billion dollars from oil and gas.

It's not just Buhari who has the right to protect this country - Everyone - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Minister of Agriculture Alhaji Sabo Muhammad Nanono has challenged state governments and local governments on the security situation in Nigeria.
In an interview with the minister, the Hausa department of Radio France International discussed how the security situation affects the farming sector.
The minister said "It is not only the federal government that has the right to security in this matter, but also state governments and local authorities, if you go down to the villages and neighborhoods, how they have managed to maintain this security situation, but everyone stands up and says it is the federal government".
The federal government has the right to regulate the lives of the people, but those who are close to these people should start the conversation that we see a problem with these issues from the beginning.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is committed to its efforts to promote agriculture and food security in the country.
President Trump Signed an Executive Order Banning Foreign Drug Importation.
On Friday, July 24th, US President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to reduce the amount of money Americans spend on prescription drugs, as he faces a legal battle to overturn the election results and criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Previously, Trump had said he would sign almost all of the executive orders he had promised to sign on Friday, but this was the first time an executive order was actually signed.
One of the rules will allow the entry of prescription drugs written by doctors from countries like Canada legally, while another rule will require drug companies to reduce their prices, according to Trump.
Another rule would require a reduction in the price of insulin if a fourth rule, which would not be implemented if negotiations with drug companies are successful, would require Medicare to purchase drugs at the same prices other countries pay, according to Trump.
A Nigerian Received an Award from the UNICEF Competition.
80,000 youths from Nigeria have joined a program of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Relief Fund for Children, taking on the burden of creating a technology solution to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide solutions to the community, which they have called the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge".
Those who received awards from Nigeria ranged from 14 to 35 years old.

The fanfare composed by Chukwuma Nwachukwu using sunlight was successful in the first round of the competition.
Chukwuma Nwachukwu said his goal is to provide clean drinking water to the communities of Abuja who do not have access to clean water.
Nwachukwu is among the Nigerian youths who joined the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge" which was launched in May and has been running for six weeks.
UNICEF has said that new innovations have shown how young people can contribute greatly when times are tough.
Approximately 60 million Nigerians, or almost one third of the country's population, do not have access to safe drinking water, according to the Water Aid charity.
Kano Elders Take Complaint to Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A coalition of human rights groups in Kano has filed a petition to President Muhammadu Buhari against Governor Abdullahi Ganduje's attempt to borrow from a Chinese bank to build a railway line.
Over 15 civil society organizations under the umbrella of the Kano Forum have expressed what they call a "collective outrage" at the government of Ganduje's plan to construct the first railway line in Kano City as something that is of no benefit given the major challenges facing the state.
The group has accused Governor Ganduje of withdrawing 684 million euros, equivalent to about three billion naira, which they say the government has not paid back in 50 years.
Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, the leader of the organization, said that it is almost impossible for the state of Kano to take on a heavier burden than what has already been imposed on it in the past.
Rape Justice in Nigeria is the Only Solution - Moderator.
A prominent figure in the Kaduna state community, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, has suggested that the only solution to the issue of rape in Nigeria, particularly in the North, is to impose the death penalty on those convicted.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this during his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, where he added that, if the government confirms this after investigation, the only solution is to impose the death penalty.
He added that making a decision would reduce the amount of sexual assault that could be experienced, but the biggest relief would be to change our mindsets.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said that in our Muslim identity, we should stand firm in our faith and be devoted to Allah and the Prophet, for no one knows when they will die.
It is shameful to say that a fully grown man or an elder would take a young girl or a three-year-old, a five-year-old, and rape her.
He went on to say that, between God and ourselves, we should not criticize rulers or kings, implying that no progress can be made if such disrespect is present.
He added that this is why we are in a state of stagnation and hardship in the country, as the rulers, kings, governors and president have no idea how to move forward with the situation.
He added that they had to demolish that building and then another one came up, so it was necessary for us to prepare our hearts for God to bring us a solution to the rape issue.
He declared that, even if it was for safety, everything should be surrendered to God for He is the one who protects all from distress and poverty.
According to him, no matter what situation a person is in, Allah knows it and all you can do is be patient and humble, always thinking that you will die and always thinking that you are behind, if you are behind in what you have been given.
He pointed out that the police, by law, are doing their best to send those accused of rape to the court of law, but this issue has become a problem in our region of Northern Nigeria and in the country as a whole.
He called on parents in particular to keep a close eye on their children, citing examples of the burdens that older sisters and brothers place on them that can lead to problems.
He said that some parents do not monitor the lives of their children, whether they go to school or not, or come home on time or not, adding that part of the blame lies with some parents for not knowing that Allah has given them children and that on the Day of Judgment He will ask them about the kind of upbringing they gave their children.

People of Rice to be Transported to Expected Destination in Early April - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Benue State are expecting a bumper harvest two months after planting.
Some of those consulted in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would be ready at any time between October and November.
A small-scale farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, a town in the state of Titus Atondo, said he planted maize in an area of two hectares in July.
Atondo said he got supplies from the market in his area and they were in two categories of CP and OC rice while he used Dazzle seasoning to share files for making soup and stew.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in the uplands are numerous because we rely heavily on manual labor as tenants cannot access mechanization.
Titus Atondo added that they take people to work in the fields from the lowest level to the harvest, adding that this is tiring and there is a lot of it.
Atondo said that all the money spent on his farm, which is now in operation, includes planting, harvesting, modern equipment and is expected to reach N2020,000.
Titus Atondo continued, but he estimated that at least 50 sacks would be the yield from the two acres, and that each sack would be sold for Naira 29,000 per 100k.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted seedlings in June to July in 274 hectares at a cost of Naira 14,500 per hectare while the land was paying Naira 25,000 per hectare.
He purchased 44 (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) varieties of seeds obtained from the National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) and some were sourced from Olam Nigeria.
He added that growth stages at this time are in different forms while some are in the process of harvesting, some are in the first stage of slaughtering animals as in the case of crop farming in stages.
The speaker added that the challenges so far have been financial since the cost of acquiring the chosen animals is expensive and the cost of fodder has increased.
He said that the harvest is expected to begin in October to November.
He added that the total cost of transportation at the end of the day would be the least Naira 246,000 per head while an expected provision of three tons would translate to Naira 360,000 on Naira 120 per kilo.
Tarnongu does not use chemicals on his millet farm, instead he advocates for and implements traditional farming methods, adding that, therefore, we use very drought-resistant seeds, herbicides and insecticides.
The Chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed his hope that the weather this year will be conducive for the cultivation of a lot of rice.
According to the Chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have entered the rice farming business at the end of this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many people from leaving their offices and staying at home.
He said, A bana bana will take up 20 percent of the production in 2019 which was estimated to be more than one million.
He said that data collectors are currently taking surveys of different types of farmers, and when the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The Chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, who said he farms three hectares of rice, noticed that some farmers were harvesting rice in June while those who farm for short periods were doing so at the expected time at the end of November or beginning of December.
The head of AFAN added that farmers use pesticides to kill pests, herbicides to kill weeds, and insecticides to kill insects.
He expressed concern about the challenges posed by animals to rice farming, adding that farmers were using traps and setting up fences around the fields to address the problem.

Conducting a Meeting on the Implementation of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Niger.
The issue of gender parity and the laws of the country that have been put in place to ensure women have full access to electoral processes in order to be able to effectively participate in the governance of the country was one of the important topics discussed at the CNDP conference, as Dr Dita Idrissa, spokesperson for the MRN political party in Niger, explained.

Reviewing the electoral system under which elections are conducted in Nigeria was one of the demands the participants of this meeting came with, arguing that it is a way to prevent fraud.
However, this requirement was not met, as according to the election authority, any form of electoral manipulation at this time of campaigning is illegal.
Opponents of those who continue to obstruct all electoral processes did not attend this meeting, a measure related to the illegality they said had been committed by the CENI electoral commission.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have disputed Abike Dabire's claim that students are subjected to ritual killings in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, the TRCN, have criticized the Chairman of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), for warning their parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, saying it is a form of human trafficking.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa issued this warning that thousands of Nigerians were being killed in Northern Cyprus without the government of the country conducting a thorough investigation.
The authority made this statement after news of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel was received.
The student, who was Nigerian, was killed and no further information has been heard since.
The sacrifice of Ibrahim Khaleel should serve as a lesson to parents to stop sending their children into the world, to be slaughtered in vain, especially in the country of Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that people don't know that the Northern Cyprus is not recognized as a country in the world.
The United Nations does not approve of the country.
But many Nigerians are living in their own country studying, yet thousands of Nigerians are being killed in the country.
The UN has said that Nigeria will reveal the names of thousands of Nigerians who have been victims of extrajudicial killings in the country.
However, as Nigerian students studying in the Northern Cyprus country argued, the peace and stability in Northern Cyprus is far better than that of Nigeria, far away rather than close.
The President of the National Association of Nigerian Students Studying Abroad (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, stated that although Nigerian students studying abroad face challenges, students in Northern Cyprus do not face any problems, challenges or obstacles.
This is what Evidence told PREMIUM TIMES in an interview.
He said it was not true that thousands of Nigerian students had died in Cyprus.
He said that the rumor of the student's death was false.
Few of those who died were victims of homicide, not accident.

The initiative taken by the leaders of Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, and the one led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, all failed.
According to the ECOWAS, no agreement has been reached despite their disapproval of the coup that forced IBK to step down from power.
Now we wait to see how it will turn out.
Religious leaders instruct their followers to adhere to truth so that there will be no cause for alarm.
The Kaduna State House of Assembly's spokesman, Yusuf Zailani, has urged religious leaders to always tell their followers the truth instead of misleading them in places of worship and creating disharmony.
Zailani expressed this when he was speaking at the Kaduna State Government House conference room when the state government was receiving the delegation of the Nigerian Christian Association who visited Kaduna yesterday.
Zailani added that "It is true that they do not like to be preached to, if you go to some places of worship you will hear their leaders preaching and condemning the morality of their non-religious peers.
This is what causes strife among people.
Finally, he said that it was necessary to come together and the religious leaders should teach the people the message of God the Almighty, as it is written in our religious books, or else there would be no peace.
The senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, who attended the meeting, asked those who are not residents of Kaduna to think carefully before speaking.
This conflict has been going on for more than 40 years.
For the first time, a governor was appointed who could put an end to this problem.
But because some people only hear one side of the story, many people only hear one side of it, apart from other sides.
Many N-Power youths are participating in the program.
Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Farouk, has stated that many of the beneficiaries of the N-Power, the Cash Allowance Scheme, are working in various places, according to research.
In the statement released by the minister on Thursday, she confirmed that there are indeed people who have not been paid, but this issue did not originate from her office. The office has already submitted the names of more than 500,000 people to be verified and paid their arrears.
She said that there are certain names that are used to identify those who support the organization, receiving money after working in certain places.
This preparation is for those without jobs, but some of the beneficiaries of the N-Power grant scheme are working in some places and receiving the grant.
Now tracking and tracing is being done to identify and locate those who are to be paid from among those listed.
Ask those who have benefited from the unpaid plan to be patient that they will soon hear good news.
N-Power participants staged a protest against the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya, in Abuja.
Thousands of youths who attended the protest rally to oppose the discontinuation of the N-Power program from the country held in Abuja on Friday have expressed that it was a wrong decision for the government to discontinue the program for the youths.
The citizens marched to the Parliament to demonstrate their disapproval of the suspension of the program within a short period of time.
One of the attendees of the gathering and a representative from Kano state, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES HAUSA reporter, stated that they are calling on the government to reverse its decision and pay those who have not yet received their third installment of allowances.
They also called for financial aid , given that the youth have long benefited from this government support.
After meeting with some of the members of the legislature who heard their cries, they then proceeded to the Federal Government Employees Department to confront the Minister of Social Welfare, Sadiya Farouk.
The renowned Human Rights Activist, Comrade Mustapha Soron Dinki, who traveled from Kano to Abuja with the youths, said that this march was done to remind the minister of those who benefit from the many schemes but do not respect their rights before they are stopped.
Since early morning, the youth have been demonstrating in the Parliament.
We hope that the government will hear the cries of these young people and provide them with solutions that will help them to continue living in dignity.
The youth holding the placard with writing on it are calling on the government to show them mercy.

The King's Men, I Praise Them For Their Praise.
The film filled with songs by Beyonce titled "Black is King", which celebrates the continuing influence and success of Black people around the world, due to its representation of African culture.
In South Africa, where this 85-minute film was made, many people say it surpasses the film.
Black is King is a film full of songs, led by the renowned American singer and songwriter Beyonce, featuring performances and culminations.
This film featured a soundtrack titled "The Lion King: The Gift", or "The King of Lions: A Gift".
The film was shot in America, West and Central Africa, and Europe, and it featured many African musicians.
This film, released in July, received positive reviews from audiences, but there were also detractors.
Some say that Beyonce, born in Houston, Texas in the US, appropriated African elements without context, particularly in her film, despite having no ancestral ties to the African continent.
But in South Africa, there is much celebration for those who took part in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student studying film, said he was honored to be included in the film-making group.
He said the movie moved him.
The film touched on many topics that are not taught in school about the history of the Middle East.
He said that when he saw the film, he began to see the story and the costumes she was wearing and the whole film, which brought out many more things than what was planned to happen.
King Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce, said that Africans in diaspora - including African-American descendants - have the opportunity to use what some consider to be African cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the movie.
The king said that women should be relegated to a lower level in society.
Therefore, their involvement in such influential matters is a source of strength.
The student reading about filmmaking, Mathebula, said that watching Beyonce's film made him interested in making his own film to spread messages about Africa.
African fans of Beyonce are united on one thing: If the King is a Man, then Beyonce is the Queen.

We must find ways to expand our work in prevention, provision of relief and mobilization of public support which will help us to improve our work in the future.
At the same time that farmers were harvesting their crops in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto State began to complain about the threats posed by pests, which could potentially reduce the expected yield.
The presence of locusts in the Sokoto State area is seen as a blessing in disguise, given the signs of a good harvest this 2020.
Apparently, some local farmers adopted an ancient practice of chasing away locusts, as described by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni region.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said that the locusts are now destroying all the crops they started to devour in the fields.
The Chairman of the Nigerian Farmers Association of Sokoto State, Murtala Gagado Minannata, has stated that currently two-thirds of Sokoto State are facing this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of the small districts in the state in order to compile a report to be sent to the state and federal agriculture departments to take measures to help the farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture's Director of Pest Control, Ya'u Maƙeri Kagara, has stated that it will not take more than one year to complete the pest control operation in the Sokoto area.
He added that the refugees were coming from the Republic of Niger and the country of Benin, and that international relations required an agreement before they could work together to solve the problem.
In June, the federal government launched a de-infestation project in 12 northern Nigerian states bordering foreign countries from which pests were entering Nigeria.
But resolving this issue could set back the progress that governments claim to be making in the field of agriculture that they are giving special attention to.

A New COVID-19 Relief Bill Will Be Reintroduced in the US.
As the numbers of those infected with COVID-19 continue to rise in America, today Monday it is expected that members of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives will present a relief bill.
It is thought that the bailout will bring in one trillion dollars to alleviate the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan is to provide the first round of financial aid to millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the days leading up to the expiration of the stimulus package.
Yesterday, after days of negotiations with Republican lawmakers in Congress, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the relief package would include an expansion of the program to provide money to those who have lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see a return of 70 out of 100 of the money they were given before.
On Friday the first round of relief will end, with some payments made to those who have lost their jobs, and an additional $600 per week on top of what the states are providing.
Republicans are complaining that this scheme means some people are being paid double, receiving both federal and state government assistance when they are working.
But Democrats on their side have challenged this statement, arguing that with the increasing spread of the coronavirus, some employees do not have the security to return to work.
The reason for my return to the APC after leaving the PDP.
Former Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has stated the reasons for his switch from the PDP to the APC after the President's re-election announcement of the return of the Mai Mala Buni party.
In a letter he wrote to the PDP in his constituency of Bogoro, Dogara stated that the resignation of his governorship in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed administration, which helped him to achieve success, was the reason for his departure from the party.
He said he could not open his mouth to ask how the government of the state was being run without being accused of disloyalty, so he took his leave from the party.
The former Speaker of the House said that if he were to take up arms, he would guarantee that everything would be done according to the laws of Bauchi State under the government of Bala Muhammed, after at the time of Governors Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar everyone heard his voice and expressed his opinion if he saw something wrong.

He said the plan included the government's distribution of metric tons of food to 100,000 households in the poorest areas to combat food insecurity and hunger during the Coronavirus pandemic.
He said that within a year this grand plan is expected to provide 5 to 10 million jobs for young people.

People need to be aware of the 2019 Sharia Law Code - KCSF.
The Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in collaboration with the European Union, the British Council, and the Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (Rolac), presented a paper on the enforcement of the 2019 Penal Code, with the aim of empowering independent civil society organizations in Kano State.

Discussion on the New Regulation for the Registration of Places of Worship in Nigeria.
The human rights and economic development organization SERAP has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately suspend the Nigerian Attorney General Abubakar Malami and the Registrar General of the Corporate Affairs Commission over their plan to begin registering places of worship.
According to SERAP, this measure is a violation of human rights as outlined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights organizations voiced their concerns about this government action, religious leaders from different faiths had already presented their grievances to the Buhari government, that the House of Representatives should reconsider and approve this law, so that it would not conflict with the religious freedom and tolerance provided by the country's constitution.
Pastor John Buro, the head of Christians in Kaduna State, told a Muryar Amurka reporter that this law does not have a basis, but if the government is trying to restrict worship or impose restrictions, then it is wrong.
He should only use existing methods to monitor and track those who violate the law without introducing a new law.
On his part, Dr. Bashir Yankuzo, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Science and Technology in Minna, said that while it is right for the government to keep an eye on companies and organizations for national security, that does not mean that it should be done at the expense of infringing on the rights of individuals or groups.
Now it remains to be seen if the government will heed this public outcry.
How the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) attempted to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has taken on the responsibility of blocking access to the PREMIUM TIMES website, a well-known Nigerian online newspaper.
This attempt to bypass internet firewalls, which are used to control access to people's websites, was made using any means possible, but it was unsuccessful.
He began to tamper with the system, "hacking", on February 28, where he hacked into the university's computer system and kept track of his progress by using the university's "data".
On the other hand, if he tried to access the PREMIUM TIMES internet bundle from his computer, he would have to launch another attack with his GSM phone.
For five days he tried to break into the PREMIUM TIMES main server, but he was unsuccessful, despite using various modern technology tools.
He was unsuccessful in his attempt, because the university was unaware of the PREMIUM TIMES' comprehensive program that it had built, which was a formidable and impenetrable barrier that no ordinary person could break through.
Furthermore, PREMIUM has a team of modern cyber security experts including PREMIUM TIMES Warlord, Chief of Security and PREMIUM TIMES Webmaster.
These security personnel with modern expertise in thwarting any terrorist or criminal attempt to commit sabotage or carry out an assassination attempt are featured in the PREMIUM TIMES Database.
What Kind of Content Did the Internet Subscriber Bring to the PREMIUM TIMES Website?
At 8 o'clock in the morning he began to unlock the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Main Building, so he could see how to make a hole in it and dismantle the entire structure.
When he failed to succeed in the night, the next morning at 6:15 he tried again, this time using "WPScan", which is used to detect the strength or weakness of security measures of major websites like PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes he began to attempt to escape using the modern technology of a computerized "custom script".
He then made every effort to block the PREMIUM TIMES website completely by using computer firewall technology.
How the Farmer Solved the Problem of the Wild Boar:
This hacker was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had conducted a thorough investigation into the small-scale and large-scale hackers who were infiltrating modern communication networks to hijack or take down websites.
This lack of knowledge is why all the equipment he used were all vintage pieces that could not be faulted or blamed on PREMIUM TIMES.
On this day he endured hardship and fatigue in order to traverse the ancient route of the NTP Likau River, a path that had been used since the days of the Kano village.
On March 3rd he tried every trick in the book to clear his mind, but none of them worked.
This attempt to break into the PREMIUM TIMES headquarters came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published a report on the alleged rivalry between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, and the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.
Some at the Federal University of Technology in Akure have informed PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired some hackers to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website and to either deface or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, it distanced itself from this attempt to evade the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Mainframe.
FUTA said that only if a student enrolled in the university was a self-payer, not with FUTA's support.

As the Kano State government reduced its budget by about 70 billion naira due to the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the state's economy, the state legislature enacted a new law governing the government's financial management and expenditure.
However, the civic organizations of the city say that drafting the law is easy, but implementing it is the challenge.
Establishing a new fiscal framework for government expenditure based on democratic principles is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State which has been established at both the federal and state levels in Nigeria in recent years.
The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Honorable Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice of America that the law will give employees and the state government guidelines on how to spend their money, as well as how the state will monitor its expenditure.
Now, the civic organizations of the city have welcomed this law, provided that it is implemented with caution.
The Director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement based in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, has expressed hope that government officials and the state government will implement the law as it should be.
But the Kano State Commissioner of Finance and Economic Planning, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they had made adequate preparations to work with the new tax regime.
Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, signed the new law at the end of last week, and it is expected to come into effect immediately.

But nevertheless we have seen fit to come with our own eyes to see it for ourselves.
This government issued a timetable for how the Edo and Ondo elections will be conducted, starting on February 6, 2020.
We have given ourselves almost seven weeks to prepare for the two events very well.
Today I am pleased to announce that we have implemented 10 out of the 14 procedures that INEC had planned to carry out.
No one found any fault with the plan until it was time to carry it out on the appointed day.
Finally , the registration of all voters in a single batch of 14 parties to compete in the election of Jacob was recorded.
He said that the four remaining tasks for INEC included issuing the election announcement to be held on the coming Tuesday, presenting the names of the candidates of each party that participated in the election, all on the same day.
And suspend campaigning for 24 hours before the election.
The campaign for the 12th of Thursday will be suspended before Saturday's election.
So we just have to wait and see, and wait for the election day.
Hear Jacob.
He did however note that the Edo State gubernatorial election is the first election INEC will be conducting during the coronavirus period.
He said that the election commission had come up with guidelines on how to conduct the election in this current situation.
We tested the system and procedures in a small-scale mock election in Nasarawa State.

Initially, the Edo State Electoral Commissioner, Johnson Alalibo, stated that there were 2,210,534 registered voters in Edo State.
He said there were 1,159,325 males and 1,051,209 females.
A dispute has arisen between the United States and China.
China has expressed its opposition to the US closing its consulate in Chengdu on Friday.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has announced that it has decided to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, USA, at the beginning of this week in response.
While Beijing has issued warnings to exercise caution, the White House has yet to retract its travel advisories.
Fifteen years ago, the United States opened an office in Chengdu with about two hundred employees.
The relationship between the two countries has been in a difficult situation since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, while they are trying to resolve the conflict, to sign a trade agreement.
The Atyap, Hausa-Fulani have reached an agreement for a period of peace between them.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities living in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have successfully concluded a peace-building meeting to promote lasting peace in their area.
The participants of the meeting who showed determination and willingness to promote peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness in their region, denounced violence, looting, and destruction of property.
They also agreed to assist security forces and provide confidential information to capture any criminals hiding in their areas.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to deploy security personnel in the area, as well as the various youth groups for their commitment to mutual respect and rejection of anything that could lead to conflict in the area, as well as the efforts of the youth to achieve the success of this peace agreement between them.
The meeting, chaired by the traditional ruler of Agwatyap, Dominic Gambo Yahaya, brought together three communities to discuss ways to promote peace and stability.
The meeting was held at the Mary and Jacob Event Centre in Wakili Street.
The meeting was also chaired by ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr. Salim Umar, who represented the Atyap kingdom, to facilitate peace between the communities, stop bloodshed and restore the properties that were in dispute between them.
All three leaders of the Atyap, Fulani and Hausawa communities put their signatures on the document after the meeting with the revered Agwatyap.
In a document following the meeting containing 14 points, the Atyap kingdom residents called for someone to take the law into their own hands, instead of continuing to appeal to security forces.
The meeting also demonstrated the assurance given by the Nigerian government to every Nigerian to be free and safe in any part of the country, including the Atyap Chiefdom, without fear or intimidation from anyone in any form.
The meeting also called on authorities to facilitate the safe return of all refugees to their homes.
The meeting also proposed the establishment of a peace committee comprising the Hausa, Fulani, Atyap and their youths to organize major rallies and discussions on issues related to maintaining peace from time to time for the promotion of peace in their kingdom.
A peace and reconciliation meeting is coming up in the days after the Kaduna State Government issued a directive on the enforcement of the ban on open grazing in the Zangon Kataf and Kaura Local Government Areas of the State to curb inter-communal conflicts.
How Governor Ganduje is replacing the judges that King Ado and Sanusi dismissed, he is appointing new rulers in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 Kano State Law, so as to ensure the recognition of the two major Kano Emirate Chiefs, the late Emir Ado Bayero and Emir Sanusi, as the major traditional rulers in Kano.
Kano State Assembly's Speaker, Abdullahi Gafasa, read Governor Ganduje's request before the Assembly, and it is expected that they will hold a discussion session on the matter before the end of July.
The rulers who were restored to the Kano Emirate were Aminu Babba Ɗan'agundi and, who was the King of Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
Kings Ado and Muhammadu Sanusi were deposed, on the charge of corruption.
Father Dan'agundi was challenged to appear in court.
The law was enforced for 17 years until the Supreme Court ruled that it should cease.
And it is also that Ganduje wants to ascend to his throne, and to amend the law to make him one of the rulers of the Kano kingdom.
Ado Bayero was removed from office in 2003 after being accused of corruption and interference in politics.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to not attend the committee in order to protect himself.
He appealed the decision from the High Court of Kano State to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal High Court had ruled to reinstate Aminu Babba to his seat.
But under the rule of Muhammad Sanusi II, the Kano Emirate was restored, where the Koli Court declared the removal of him as the Governor of the West and the King of Dawaki Mai Tuta on the 5th of June.
After Sanusi Bayero, the Emir of Kano, refused to accept the appointment of Muhammad Sanusi II as the King of Kano in June 2014.
Later, he was appointed the Head of the National Water Resources Authority under Jonathan's administration.
Wamban Kano was appointed under the current King of Kano.

NAPTIP arrested human traffickers and rescued 71 people in Kano State.
The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in Kano State has arrested three human traffickers and rescued 71 people from their custody in the state.
Kano State Command Commissioner Shehu Umar announced this on Friday during a meeting with the Nigerian News Agency.
He said that the agency had imposed travel restrictions on people after it obtained confidential information about people's travel activities in the state.
That is why the authorities carried out a raid on these people from the 15th to the 19th of July, and were successful in apprehending them.
Of the three people we arrested, two were from Cameroon and one from Nigeria, and their ages ranged from 21 to 36.
These people were arrested while travelling to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.
Additionally, 18 of the 71 people going on the journey from the country of Kamaru are male, and 4 are female.
The remaining 19 people from Nigeria are 11 males, 8 females, all from the state of Kano.

Effort, Perseverance and Seeking to Advance, It's in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The village of Longyuan in Hongsipu district of Wuzhong city in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, located in the northern part of China.
There is a famous woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Muslim name) who is renowned for her struggles in life and her success in escaping poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort, perseverance and striving are all part of the heart.
Initially, neither Li Yaomei nor Sadiya had ever been to school with the intention of receiving an education, which is why she was unable to read or write.
But God gave her wisdom, courage and great insight, where she became an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from a uterine tumor, which required her to undergo surgery 3 times.
After her departure, she encountered a terrible accident, and now she is traveling with a cast on her arm.
These challenges she faced put her in a difficult situation, even concerning the issue of medication, which is why she had to accept a debt of around 3 million Yuan, equivalent to about 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly, this challenge that Mrs. Sadiya faced opened up a path of self-discovery and transformation for her to improve her life.
The support from the Chinese government further strengthened her confidence.
Art is the creative use of different materials to create something new.
Because of her efforts, her business has grown significantly, with different employees providing her with various inputs.
In addition, she created many tools to help her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take her 15 minutes to make one big braid, but now in this time she can make up to 5 braids.
In addition, she provided additional tools to clean up the debris she left behind.
There is also a machine that cleans animal food, and now even selling these machines to those who need them.
Considering the challenges that Madam Sadiya has faced, and her ongoing efforts to improve her own life and that of her employees, it is clear that she is a seeker of both success and fulfillment.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of living standards is not something that rests solely on the shoulders of government.
If the government continues to provide aid, but people lack the motivation or desire to improve their lives by taking initiative based on their current situation, then progress will only be made without achieving any real goal.
The narrative suggests that conducting a business or earning money does not require large amounts of money or trips to other cities or foreign countries.
In order to take into account her circumstances, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, Sadiya conducted these tasks independently and without relying on her husband, as he had to leave her.
Effort, perseverance, and striving are all in the heart.
He also demonstrated the strength women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone else.
This lesson also shows that whatever one does, one should stand by one's convictions, for relying on another is not certain.
Indeed, Sadiya was a model of perseverance, intelligence and courage, and an example and lesson for others.
Furthermore, by the month of March, Madam Sadiya had paid off all her debts, and had stopped receiving government aid on her own accord.

American Politicians Could Derail Efforts to Contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the measures taken by some countries to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be available, stating that it is necessary to avoid showing favoritism to certain nations while distributing the vaccine.
And the resources should be shared in a fair way around the world, because that would be in line with the major interests of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing a strategy of demonstrating their own success in distributing the vaccine, as well as criticizing the cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has surpassed 23 million.
In total, there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease exceeding 800.
Under such difficult circumstances, attention is being focused on the impact of the vaccine against the virus, and the good news is that, in recent weeks, there has been a major breakthrough in the study of the vaccine in some countries, which has provided hope and faith to the entire world population.
But the worrying thing is that some American politicians have shown a desire to seize the oil.
The journal "Science" has reported that the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for more than $6 billion from multiple pharmaceutical companies.
Although the purpose of the US government is understood, being the leader in the fight against the virus, other developing countries also need access to vaccines, given that they suffer from a lack of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also noted that if the US achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the amount of emissions available to developing countries will decrease.
Even the Director of the African CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, expressed concern about this issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, the goal of overcoming the pandemic cannot be achieved unless there is a plan for distributing the vaccine, which is a critically important issue for countries around the world.
And it is right for the nations of the world to strengthen the bonds between them.
WHO Director-General Tedros has also emphasized that in order to see an end to the pandemic, it must be tackled from all angles around the world, and that it is not possible for some parts of the world or a few countries to achieve the goal of overcoming the impact of the virus alone.

The Buhari government's attempts to bury Abba Kyari in a cemetery were challenged in court.
A Nigerian rights activist has credited President Muhammadu Buhari's administration for all the efforts they put into the burial of Abba Kyari's remains.
Kyari, the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, was buried at the National Military Cemetery in Abuja on April 18th, after succumbing to the Coronavirus.
Tope Akinyade, who is the prosecutor, presented the Magistrate Court in Abuja with the case, asking for them to be convicted for breaking the law against human trafficking that the federal government had put in place at the time.
He said there was an injustice to Nigerians who were subjected to house arrest during the lockdown, but some large groups violated the rules and none of them were punished.
He said that if the Buhari government is truly committed to enforcement, he does not see any reason why people should be punished for breaking the Corona regulations.
Some branches of the government have broken the law but have been allowed to get away with it.
Among those Tope presented to the court, there was the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Umar.
There was also the Presidential Spokesperson of the State House, Garba Shehu, the Director of Social Media, Bashir Ahmed, the Presidential Adviser on Security Matters, Babagana Monguno, the Chief of Army Staff, Mohammed Adamu, and many other government officials.
Judge Celestine Odo sought to demonstrate that the prosecutor had erred since the defendants had not signed the complaint he had filed.
However, Tope reminded the Judge that he had come to court directly, without being escorted by the police.
He said that the judge had sent out summons to all those involved in the case to put their hands up.
He had to do what Nigerian law allowed him to do in order to file a lawsuit in court.
The judge adjourned the hearing of the case, saying to return to court on August 4th to continue the hearing.

The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made this announcement in a statement issued on Friday.
In response to a statement issued by the national chairman of the PDP, calling for the impeachment of President Buhari,
The Sheikh said that at a time when the world was coming together to fight a common enemy, the opposition party in Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), began its electoral battle.
This practice contravenes the country's governance system, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to allow investigations into several government offices, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which is tasked with fighting economic crimes in the country.
According to the statement of the party leader, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they want the president to stop the investigation but to close the issues.
Wake up from your sleep as one of their leaders has commanded.
The PDP cannot intimidate the government from imposing unjust accusations on MDAs and their leaders because failing to do so would be a historical violation of the public trust.
ECOWAS Leaders Continue Efforts to Resolve the Conflict in Mali.
Western African leaders will hold a virtual summit on Monday, July 27 to present measures to end the political crisis in Mali, after five leaders of the organization met with the Malian government and the opposition in Bamako, the country's capital, on Thursday, July 23.

The Katsina Government and Armed Bandits are Exploiting the Poor, Says Justice Ummaru Abdullahi - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We Must Return To The Truth For Peace To Reign In Nigeria.
Former Chief Justice of the Lower Court of Appeal, Sharia Lawyer Umaru Abdullahi (Hausa Speaker) has stated that the peace agreement between the Katsina State Government and the bandits, was a major mistake and a waste of taxpayers' money.
Because it had no effect or sign of ending the armed conflicts that have plagued Katsina state.
Sheikh Umar Abdullahi stated this when he was having a special discussion with reporters at his home in Katsina, including Leadership Today.
After completing the requirements for constructing a Women and Children's Ward, a contractor of twenty-five, who is a businessman from the major hospital in the city of Katsina, will be the Chairman of the meeting.
The former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court added that the agreement made with the armed group should not have been implemented in that way.
Because he said that if a terrorist brought him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, he would go to the forest and buy an AK-47 rifle.
The Hausa proverb continues to say that there is no place in the world where war brings victory, it is necessary to make peace with them, by improving the lives of the nomads, that is, providing them with places to graze, schools, drinking water and health care.
There is a Ministry of Livestock in the Northern region, and every year the Government allocates funds to farmers only, but for the pastoralists, in addition to them, it is necessary to come and make corrections and justice, then peace will be established.
But this war will not bring peace to this country, because they are all citizens of this country, peace is the right way.
Do it with good intentions and peace will be achieved.
This affects more than just us.
Our future generations and their descendants, how will they live in the future, that is the major problem.
In this world, no war has ever been fought with a weapon that has been completed with a sword, it is fought with a spear on a table.
Security experts say that negotiations should not be held with terrorists, this is a controversial opinion because even though America says it does not negotiate with terrorists, the terrorists are not American citizens, they are people from another country carrying out attacks.
We are also these armed people of this country, so it is said that there will be no peace with them.

The President of South Africa Has Rejected the Charges of Corruption.
The President of South Africa has spoken out against corruption due to the rampant corruption within the ruling ANC party of the country.
In a letter sent to all members of the ANC on Sunday, August 23, Cyril Ramaphosa began by addressing the issue of providing relief to the country in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
What brought about this disparity is the presence of private companies and individuals, including government officials, who use the healthcare system, social dynamics, and economic resources to benefit themselves, according to the letter.
This injustice of millions of South Africans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing hunger every day and lack of employment, cannot be overlooked.
In his letter, Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of the country's funds had been discovered that should be used to improve the transport sector, provide basic necessities of life to the poor, and provide reliable electricity, as well as help small-scale farmers who are struggling and develop the country as a whole, which the bandits had stolen and put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa has said that people should not think that the ANC is only a way to gain power, wealth or fame.

The agency listed the causes of the problem, including mandating people to stay at home, banning air travel, prohibiting flights, closing schools and businesses.
The agency has added that taking such measures in countries around the world has caused the price of oil to drop, while factories have been closed in countries around the world to combat the problem.
Last month, Nigeria's Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said that the Budget Office had forecasted a situation like this, due to these problems that have prevented the carrying out of daily activities, which has forced the government of the country to adjust its budget.

Nigeria's Chief of Staff Edward Kallon expressed this when he led a delegation to the Presidential Villa, saying that the security challenges plaguing the country have various levels of complexity and difficulty to address.
He said that while the soldiers were fighting, it was very important to give them space to talk and use political means to achieve peace.

Reports suggest that the legislature spends at least N1 trillion annually on infrastructure projects in Nigeria, particularly in the region affected by the Boko Haram insurgency.

I got on the bus and then I got off at the stop.
The people living in the area saw me as I was leaving but they didn't call out.

Upon arriving in the state, they stayed at a hotel where they stayed overnight before setting out to find him.

Yobe Spent N78.8m Subsidizing a Company - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The Yobe State Government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, has been commended for reviving the Yobe State Polythene Bag and Woben Sacks Company, after it had been dormant for over 10 years.
This information was provided by the General Manager, Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in an interview with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, at the beginning of the month.
He said that the company had been shut down for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was unlikely to be revived, and he gave the order to remove 78.8 million naira to repair the important parts of the company and add 48 million naira to operate it, which gave the company the opportunity to start running again.
Gadaka further clarified that this would give them the capacity to purchase the necessary equipment to start operations in the company, which included a new 500 KbA electric power generator (Generator), a 500 KbA electric power distribution device (Transformer), a new engine for pumping water, an engine for pumping water (modern) and other equipment that the company needs.

Hear God.
On the other hand, he said that the company had received a boost in sales due to the state government's patronage of the Yobe Flour and Feed Mill in Potiskum and other markets that were buying the products the company was offering.
He said that the government's efforts to modernize the railway company was also a factor in the purchase of the goods that the company was selling.
He also said, "We are facing some challenges, due to the fact that the company has been closed for more than 10 years, while the engines have started to work but we need to change some equipment to be able to operate without any fear".
Before our tasks begin, we will try to bring in the other supplies we need.
Furthermore, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are requesting the Yobe State Government to provide us with additional equipment, a large truck for carrying goods and motorcycles that we can use to facilitate our operations, especially for transporting our staff to the office to avoid going on foot, when we start our work in earnest."
He also said that at present the company has sent 25 young people to receive training on how to operate machines and devices, as well as how to manage the materials the company uses in its operations, and how to interact with customers and the public they come into contact with.
Finally, he said that the company had now started to produce various sizes of sacks, ranging from 100kg, 50kg and 25kg, and provide support to the traders regarding the type and purpose of the sacks, and the company was ready to meet their needs.

The Nigerian government has changed its stance on student testing.
The Nigerian government has changed its stance on preventing school-leavers from taking exams due to its new stance of reopening secondary schools from 4th of next month to conduct exams.
The Minister of Education of Nigeria, Ben Goong, has stated that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the examination which will begin on August 17th.

In 2003, conflict broke out in the Darfur region between the nomadic "Janjaweed" and the pro-government forces loyal to former Sudanese President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir.
The United Nations has reported that the conflict in the region has resulted in the death of more than 30,000 people, and has displaced two million and a half of its inhabitants.
In April 2019, President Omar Al-Bashir was overthrown following months of protests against his government.
