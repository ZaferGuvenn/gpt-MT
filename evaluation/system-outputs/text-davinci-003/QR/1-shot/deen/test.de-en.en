The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Quickly look, quickly help, bring the bottle etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy themselves for a short time and it is okay for them, then that is good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with them for hours while they fall asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
If something were to happen such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Help Me Find the Title of a Book Please!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows what it is...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken on by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, comes into contact with her therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each suicide and document it and post the photos online.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window while another drives herself to death intentionally.
Facing fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
This is the general plot and I'm fairly certain that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the WiFi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Four-year-old child has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) for the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with a pair of tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

Johnson will push for a refresh of Omikron.
New Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year's, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned, given the rapidly increasing Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that they are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Boost yourselves now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, there was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today I received an invitation to a meeting via email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where they come from culturally, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How can a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Try it first on #PRS_ORG#.
That has been working for about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence on a regular basis for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What Does the Series for "League of Legends" Offer?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
Johannes Patrick was reliable at least.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
The tension didn't ease after the game, but rather increased after the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the bare result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
As an example, here is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We weren't focused enough after our win at Tenerife and didn't execute what we had trained for."
Moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like I was performing in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised even more.
While in Patrick's team even the star performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Always looking sharp: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up their postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an emphasis on etiquette, Max Raabe is now an integral part of the current German music scene.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It should be supplemented with existing furniture and we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through it.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: No New Housing Will Be Created Through Expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No new housing will be created with expropriation, only the ownership structure will change," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hi, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with Storage Space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it myself when placing the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 Deaths from Tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to move through the USA.
More than 100 deaths could be reported in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes caused severe destruction in the USA and may have claimed up to one hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of display case #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Is it completely out of stock?
Is there a possibility to order this display case in another country?
When will you check in?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
Do I understand correctly that I can order the blanket in my cart and have it shipped to Germany now?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Rebranding advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old job and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with First Campaign of Your Own
Welcome!
I am currently running an adventure over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the rest of the story will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Negotiating, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 Ordinary Goblins, 2 Armed with Spears, 6 Armed with Bows and Sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears will stop the wagon.
If the battle comes and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, the half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure to start with?
The Goblin group will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
Put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the receipts sent over so I can package up the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Suddenly, the crack was there.
I was just sitting on it.
Here was the lower part, so essentially the part with storage damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hi F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky has been decreasing throughout the season, so I'm making this post to vent a bit.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Despite the delayed start and the starting crash, the schedule was far behind the plan, but they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) anyway.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still dumb, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the finish.
Despite a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both of them did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about it to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
Additionally, there are constant antics that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
This last one brings a lot of chaos to the comment, as he apparently does not take it seriously.
Finally, advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Both of these channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Get this: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still has not been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I request assistance.
Air pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system through air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the end of the offer for the table.
There you can see the services compared.
Are the pumps strong enough to run entire systems?
For a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that multiple outflows can be connected.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs depending on the model, but fan pumps are also great for adding an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a feature.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell, or something similar to mention.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can get started.
The water pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards if the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take precautions so that no one gets upset if it takes a bit longer.
Not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the logistics industry...of course, here, no one is stopping because of Corona.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the courier services.
We naturally like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they have it really tough.
This also varies regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in white here?
Amazon Founder Bezos Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator Into Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and thirteen seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just flew along with them, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would most like to go back to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was decelerated by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface to be the boundary to outer space, however there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Deputy Chief, Audrey Powers, were present.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to color change, the luminous stone will keep one light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp is proven to be reliable all year round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, your light looks even better - however, you can expect a shorter lighting duration when the days are shorter.
Please be careful in winter to make sure that no snow affects the functioning of the solar module.

Someone who has worked or studied in biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have the inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I had of course already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until I get my PhD.
Currently I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear about great job opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you do?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday and Weekend Holidays
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax and unwind.
That's why I'm adding a post now.
Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, is there a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems there are also days off before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend.
What happened last week then?
Stress Everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before departure, orders here and orders there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, why not?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been a long time and that can't be the case?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed lockdown due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just take a trip to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is necessary for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large portion of the feather loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
DDR-Handcrafted Model Old Building E-Locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 to supply a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived World War II and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increased demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 that were available in larger quantities were preferred to be built.
Once it became clear that the reprocessing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, the E 95 came into focus for reprocessing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As age increased, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the stoker who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the fire door during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors was frequent and led to months of outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have caused problems in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The designated new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives except E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The internal completion of the locomotive took place in 1986.
The locomotive is museum-maintained at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P tradition community have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, with the transformers checked and five drive motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were rehomed to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted Model H0 in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive needs to be done by the owner, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't set up the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with errors.
The center bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will you be sent off?
No flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police have taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To Debunk Fake News - Biontech CEO Releases Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information circulating on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
He has previously rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear can be hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating online, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
Now the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in Power Station: Tens of Thousands of People Without Power
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities were left without power due to the fire.
Supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support to the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical malfunction caused the fire according to the company.
Power is flowing again.
The fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back on.
Since Saturday at 6pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
Since 11:15 PM, those affected by the power outage have also had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were the main focus.
Additionally, according to authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who cannot provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
This is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I cannot mount the bracket underneath the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received 155cm in diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, however I cannot nest it and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easy!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost insulting.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat Connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply a new paint color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers will later create a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark colors could show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when mixed with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
Achieve an authentic look, the models use decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models: Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Warning: Always check that the picture is correctly positioned before completely sliding it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Wipe up excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look away from it I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place I was up to reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages for me.
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing.
In Order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received confirmation for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed by the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The Reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the room here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We will not be ordering anything else from you.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customers.
Please feel free to forward this to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you're telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the dresser arriving completely damaged at my place.
Please see the screenshot for what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or individual investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
What don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Looking to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you
Best Regards
No phone number, no chat if you have to wait 30 minutes - that's not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU.
The EU can declare a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs, however, are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not been able to resolve the confrontation sustainably, according to the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This limbo state - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose it, it comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempted Border Crossing Again
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and taken back to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The Border Patrol registered a total of 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU while in power in Minsk.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their borders, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response has been the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests After Controversial Formula 1 Finale
Mercedes believes Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach of regulations by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was made shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking on that.
I will speak to the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free Entry for Members: Europa-Park Hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars lit up that day in red and white jerseys.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park, it has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, fix it and not all from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package needs to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
We won't both admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yes, wow then you are just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
God has set this whole thing in motion for me.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To get the best view, the magnifying glass should be held as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-error free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
These conditions only apply to exact specified conditions, which rarely correspond to the terms of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When optimal usage conditions are met - lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz Community Select the Trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on anything.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
I still received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any debates here about which dish is better, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber Optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbps perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module which transmits the wifi, I no longer get the full 500, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less I get (so using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the internet with the new fiber connection now being slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch checking accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, they are mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She just halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the savings account.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Now, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the tax-free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks have now set a limit of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Banks are now discussing whether the institutions should set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, as Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
That they still manage to win the hearts of both male and female fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness too.
Disgraceful End to a Career: Raikkonen Forced to Retire
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport top class.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Kimi Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He initially defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second on Saturday, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, Germany, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously coming in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race and ended up in eighth place.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte Wins at Home - Podium for Jamanka
At the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi to a World Cup victory on Sunday, resulting in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She achieved an Olympic qualification and her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden, Germany placed third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get a podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me along.
I am super happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in my cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I'm finally asking about it.
Last year due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said it had expired which made me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting on March 16th?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for some others...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also under the weather and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is causing me difficulty with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having tummy troubles, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have homework coming up that we need to divide between us.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am somewhat well treated and coping.
Not great, but I'm getting by and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams otherwise.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately the whole color is different plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as it appeared on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
Furthermore, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious studies teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always felt strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
What is your opinion on this?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope the question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I am happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been around for a long time, so I would stay away from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello everyone,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
The Modern (Real World).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman, whom I cannot describe further in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to gain life for himself.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If this rings a bell, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week one.
Fast forward: Still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, check in often but don't be overbearing.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh Air in the Room.
Good Mattress.
No Pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Turn your head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the stomach area?
Or is it face down Directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have purchased many items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno's quote: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are we now?
A generic advertising channel trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
You are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is one supposed to find all of this good?
I'm glad if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Damage to shipment from #PRS_ORG# causing disruption of inventory.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My little heat friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they don't feel so good.
The Cherry Pit Pillow with Cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold, or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow for warming before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
After heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking it!
Afterwards, put the inner pillow back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but it will disappear with repeated applications.
Make sure to follow the given heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Check with the manufacturer's instructions before heating a pillow in the microwave to make sure heating grain products is allowed.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.

Darmstadt Second in First Half of Season - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, things are not running well even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up even with the power adapter plugged in.
So then I took out the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# Chair.
I don't know how high the seat area is.....
Frequently on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 Liters of capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, stay organized and separate from your photography equipment thanks to convenient access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well thought out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap, with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
Magnetic snap and hook closures are also included.
This way the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks in a fundamental way: in addition to the lid flap, there are also zipper openings on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
This clever detail also greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior to your needs (more on that below) and easily store items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact from the shipping company announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any message yet.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one suffering the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In Winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneering colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, your selection will be revealed and you will place your pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock-out!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough Gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins!
With free shipping, I take the shipping method, Parcel (Games wrapped) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else usually shipped with DPD insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in tissue paper and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can send the item in a box within a box for an additional cost of 2 euros to ensure that there are no pressure marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
Child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
To us parents and other responsible adults, it must never, ever, ever be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible, as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Countries Advise on Abolishment of Testing Requirement for Those Who Are Fully Vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been fully vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already on Tuesday next week". − afp
I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you are describing is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and most rarely perceiving pain.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut, a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex had no awareness by definition.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the broken chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce in addition to legal obligations.
Please check again if you can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
Again, the question.
On the order and invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I need to cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had a question posed.
Theater Historian Günther Rühle Dies at 97
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The Shattering Diary of a Slow Farewell to the World, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give thanks for my life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York Wins MLS Championship for the First Time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference Finals, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got lots of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was served for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I'm getting the taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, only a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I can manage this.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18th January that the refund was processed.
Until today, the money has not been received by me.
Please check there.
Where to Find Christmas Roast in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
Additionally, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that you can even make a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL control if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal being processed here is simulated with a speaker, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an excellent "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live deployment.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
I had seen it like that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
I would like to return them then.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update in the next few weeks about the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations for the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that are to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overtakes Saxony - Free State Now Has Highest Corona Incidence Rate
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day rate at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in the country, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only be in early March, it might be possible by then.
I need to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, is that it?
Do I need to click/enter/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself.
An 8 euro return fee is an outrage in my opinion.
It's time for changes.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the German Bundestag in the past months, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction of how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still really want the Bundestag.
What We Need to Change
Here, the community around the German Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The initiative was started by u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What Existing Orders Need to be Changed/Adjusted/Removed?
How should we present ourselves to the public in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end for that.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be collected in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I do not have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
Anyone from #PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I was a vegetarian myself for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty as well.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was a feeling of discontent on her side, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I am quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending to do so.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be present due to a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
Starting from February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnstein Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle for water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein at the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in operation since November 2020 was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, Mayor of Lahnstein.
The Rescue Vehicle is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a continuous expectation of increasing investments: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel Rivers, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn River as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed, and reloaded the app and NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because this whole process has taken a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, it should be said that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people who are naturally attracted to conservative and magical uniforms and weapons carriers may have difficulty dealing with reality, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
Even these marginalized groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them and tries to do right by them, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Returning to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there. However, it is completely exaggerated in the media that these people are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Naturally, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain ideological allies meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well combated in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined that it is good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could we deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany, or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
And there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Orderly through child?
Hi, I (32w) have been pondering something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed with very little free time), but I have struggled to keep my household clean and organized for most of my life.
There are always phases where everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that someone could come over spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
I don't have much motivation for myself, it doesn't bother me as long as there are no visitors and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide more motivation or does one remain lazy?
Looking forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, extended shaping at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
The Focea Comfort 4 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System 2 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows and knee bends)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface texture that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face on the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure which does not adhere to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff.
45° Notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P Back Zip (Wetsuit without Hood) with Metal Slider and Built-in Water Dam System for Improved Sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on Arms and Legs
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene Panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for increased durability.
Notched inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in Social Work - As Someone With An Insecure Personality Disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The Problem: I have an Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, that means I have low self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems for me (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein ingested with the feed is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these, in turn, its own protein substances are built up, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in nestlings and feather renewal in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a Community Worker in Opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree needs to be cut down on our property.
Appeal filed to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that felling fruit trees and thus walnuts is not part of the regulations.
The constitution explicitly states that the walnut tree is to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?

Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling here.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field as well (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now on my third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to keep going and finish at least the draft, after that I can always switch direction.
I'm absolutely exhausted right now.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally it's fun and from the outside it looks like the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can tell it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
Maybe your opinions can help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely up to date with the latest sound technology.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system that produces natural resonances in abundance.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined multiple times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp section primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7 tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and tone character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 Points from Wagner, Magic Lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner Brothers shine, but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot-shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make the perfect choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano Eruption on La Palma: Likely the Longest in History
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was previously considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There is no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the Millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, with damages estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed from cooled lava with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly hard hit.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, more areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children will be eagerly awaiting the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christmas Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days to gift-giving.
In the past, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold secretly into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom emerged of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession.
Today you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a jolly confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for entering houses through the chimney.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police Shoot Suspected Bank Robber Near the King's Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
The man fled according to authorities in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum Illumination Time 10 Hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
Completely harmless, however, is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar light fascinates with its light - either in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own due to his size.
Save yourself the hassle of extensive preparations: Smart Stone solar lights require neither power supply nor batteries.
Place the "sunstone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; what color it will be is up to you: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The device will also automatically shut off once the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.

Pill Problem
Hello lovely ladies!
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is this actually my first post on Reddit after a year?
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that behind again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne all over my body during my last two-year break from 0 to 100.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two year break, things never really normalized.
Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid this this time?
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to make an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-pubertal severe eczema, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of diets in relation to chronic illness and have settled on a low sugar, low dairy and low meat diet because nothing else has worked properly.
It could also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have construction sites everywhere like I do, you don't really want to go looking for what else could be wrong.
I had already given everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote something and now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What would have been to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
But is it generally available in large sizes?
As it is available in large sizes in black.

110 kV Underground Cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pole of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning!
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number: #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about it, I already explained that multiple times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is for all books, that is why the request was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I am currently having a lot of difficulty planning my geography lessons in an efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
We are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need it for tutorials, etc.).
I usually start planning by considering the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to structure it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with the book Terra and most of the tasks it presents.
Therefore the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book efficiently.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only allowing entry to those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there have been sales declines at stores selling non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of businesses had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the high point of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Business is only running well in the grocery retail and online sectors.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G shopping won't get us far in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation must be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band they received.
Furthermore, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, with revenues at around 90 percent.
These numbers are sure to drop now in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Operating with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality arises from the possibility of operating with economical NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Additionally, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight with electricity through the included power supply.
The assembly of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Great care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won two consecutive games, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
Then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it up, scoring five goals in a good hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and winning 5-2 in a spectacular fashion. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered on DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular pleasure for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-prepared in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
Now let's "proceed step by step and stay humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6:30 PM, Sky) on the schedule.
I just received an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# to get it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
That would unfortunately mean for me that I won't order again because it already took a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and vacant stares after their humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged German national team coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After their first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke was soon shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game better and at least got within five goals by half-time.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
The Groener-Schützlinge sinned again in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
In the following, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, it will then continue in part to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does this interact with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include providing information about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is eligible for a vaccine according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Order and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and potentially providing emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger Knows the Solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has caused intense contemplation.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also no one "who needs everything to go quickly".
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated as the solution, likely causing surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that "the huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
A gap in education was closed - likely also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have reset, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Tire Selection for Road Bikes - Really That Puncture-Proof?
I woke up full of enthusiasm this morning because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said, done and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what usually lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to go any further on the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't too bad weather-wise either, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really rather not have this problem recurring.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike!) and he had already described them as suboptimal, since he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
When I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€/tire only to be disappointed in the end.
I'm still wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that have this feature, but most are wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you recommend different tires for a road bike in general?
The Swallow website seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!
Car Skids Into Tree: Driver Fatally Injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new addition and visually resembles the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
Additionally, this design proposal includes a custom-designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is particularly suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a secondary role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels nearly unfiltered.
That doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-frequency boost.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Tilted slightly outward, the high frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our speaker kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
If you want to veneer the cabinet, for example, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at a hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom will now be glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, including both sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Marking and pre-drilling (2.5mm drill bit) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block follows.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuumed/blown out), the cable laying begins.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
Push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leave it sticking out about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, run the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loose there as well.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The wiring diagram of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
By using a 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello to all!
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
However, at least three people will be on the call, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
