Students Take the Lead in Singing at Zhejiang University Academic Conference - Research Results Open Up New Horizons - Xinhua News
Hand-washing with air, sniffing out diseases, and pinpointing sources of smog – these were among the brain-busting academic achievements that were recognized at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Year Conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Care Physician
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor for smartphones, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a deep breath and this apparatus can preliminarily detect your body's health status from the components of the breath you exhale."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands on the market that can detect health conditions generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the physical health status.
Smart Surgery Light: Doctors' High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights have also been used in the operating room.
This invention was awarded a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED shadowless surgical light.
"Many diseases are detected early, not cut in place, related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in the case of early cancer detection, if the doctor is not able to see all the tumour tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing hands: Saving water and being cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and other students invented a "air hand washing device".
Just step on the device's sink and our weight will compress the air out.
"Like a balloon.
Compressed air, forming a fluid at the tap and combining with water.
That way, we can get our hands clean!
Colorimetric tests and bacterial residue tests prove that the effect of handwashing with this method is the same as with conventional handwashing methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange to replenish it to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, not points, and will never use #PRS_ORG# again!

Alright, trouble.
A meaningful certificate book - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
FYI: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken in case of sudden incidents, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when emergency aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have a window of only four minutes for life, the golden four minutes!
So how important it is to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
"In China, official data shows that three million people die from accidents every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average 15% can be saved nationally.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no pulse, it is of no use to pinch them.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be done in order to have a chance of saving someone.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
Maybe we can save one life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training centre - I signed up at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai and there were student discounts too.
PS: The last picture is of the goals I wanted to accomplish before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, I'm planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered # #NUMBER#
One of them is 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!?
Haven't tried.
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered the wrong order, this time it was just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To cut to the chase, I personally think 'Four Seas' is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you were to say that the movie wasn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack was pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, such as the ones that make you fall asleep in the cinema, or the ones that make you angry after watching. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han really is gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like the coat on Gregor Samsa.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors the director was implying, but when you think about it closely, it turns out to be a pile of crap.
Let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
Elderly people riding in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about it.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
How come the island's biker gang can easily block off a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around couldn't find it.
This propinquity is pretty obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit and criminal suspicion become a police auxiliary?
In the movie, why didn't the police report the usury and did they specifically ask if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then has to arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door for the night?
This nonsensical plot was pervasive throughout the film, and I find it painful to recall due to its absurdity.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, is the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which is a hideous patchwork of abominations.
At the beginning of the movie you would think he was trying to make a comedy, 20 minutes later you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel like it could be a story about how hard it is to survive as a small town youth, and after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep suspicion of yourself for why you ran to the cinema to enjoy crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are actually quite familiar with the tropes of various movies, for example if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(Like the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character just got burned and still can sing), you can't go open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female lead obviously not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in some aspects, I really don't know if it's due to the acting or the director's request.
And one thing I'm also quite curious about, why is Han Han so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies as a race car driver?
Is the movie scheduled for the Spring Festival slot to give the audience a headache?

Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Program - New Huanxin Net: Enrollment is Equivalent to Being a Qualified Employee of the Enterprise
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, a tripartite agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the school and the enterprise. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18, a four-party agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentice during the on-the-job training.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools are to reform the talent cultivation model.
School-enterprise joint design of talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program has a trial period of training, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, with on-the-job training generally lasting for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot program having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Following the principle of piloting first and then gradually expanding from point to surface, explore and establish a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the employment rate and quality of students.

I have been considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally made the tough decision. The suction is good and the dust in the house is obviously much less. The only downside is that it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; the wet mop needs to be improved, as it leaves dust marks when going back and forth; overall, I am still very satisfied.
The cooking machine is quite heavy and looks high-end, suitable for me as a kitchen novice. The child said it was better than what I cooked myself. I have made two dishes and two vegetarian dishes, especially the sweet and sour spare ribs are delicious. It takes a long time for some dishes, but it is very short for others. The noise is very small, so there is no need to worry about burning or not being able to cook!
Received the goods, couldn't wait to fry three dishes at noon. Technology really changes life. The control of heat and seasoning is accurate, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the chef level. Not bad, it is a god-like tool for those who are not good at cooking. Highly recommend buying it!

South African doctors: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omecron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-strong group of doctors in the Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pilley said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill if they contract the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within days.
Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30 per cent of the recent hospitalised COVID-19 patients were severely ill, half the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3 per cent of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20 per cent in South Africa's early outbreak.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, all indications are that this is a milder disease."
He also said: &quot; It is still early, we need to get late-stage data.&quot;
Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delta still being the main coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omega variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, there was a 400% increase in new cases reported in the first week of December in the province of Hauden, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of the cases.
Thanks to all the supporters today, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Times Review: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we were to use the famous public service slogan "No Buy, No Sell, No Kill", then in an environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", collective prevention and public anti-trafficking efforts can make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has gone online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app "Reunion" makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
The new technological means not only have a name of "artistic" and full of feelings, but also the information utilization is proper, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to locate and recover trafficked children and protect their safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But the personal safety of victims should be given priority before trafficking cases are broken.
We should set aside for now the controversial topics such as "Should child trafficking be punishable by death?" and discuss them cautiously, while we should not delay the urgent task of rescuing trafficked children.
According to the investigative experience of such cases, traffickers usually leave the scene of the crime as soon as they have achieved their goal.
A delay of one minute in the abduction could mean a step further away from the parents and an increase in the difficulty of solving the case.
In this case, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to crack cases and find missing children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "enforcement" is a big job that requires the whole legal system to be in operation.
Combating crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Furthermore, prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can still be improved.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child gone.
It is not to be expected that a two-year-old child has enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest or placing the child in a safe environment are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's Criminal Code, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years; for particularly serious circumstances, it can be the death penalty, and confiscation of property.
With the trend towards &quot;leniency&quot;, the offence of child trafficking is clearly one that is subject to heavier penalties, with a high starting point and a maximum sentence.
There are still a considerable number of trafficking cases occurring every year to this day.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the trafficking "market" is widely present, traffickers are driven by greed and constantly innovate their trafficking methods, forming a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking efforts will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to root out the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress at Mount Malan.
Draw strength from the Party's hundred-year struggle history.

He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to firmly follow the Party, and to contribute their youth to write responsibility and commitment.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's fault or the rider's fault.
No receipts on the bag.
Untraceable
Hope you guys get the gist.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No more, thank you.
Yes, already changed a rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the works.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil) with five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering of fresh olives to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavour, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or known as "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with acidity below 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction from the pomace and refined by solvent extraction.
You should have noticed from the grading classification that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Know that olives, like grapes for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, producing different grades of olive oil.
Best Place for Olive Tree Growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive growth, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only cultivate it sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., as well as countries with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru and South Africa, which are located at much lower latitudes.
Months for olive picking:
From March to June each year is the time when olive trees flower and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for fruit picking (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Components of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders from 110 countries around the world, from Governments, civil society and the private sector, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also stated that a second Global "Democracy Summit" is planned to be held next year.
Taiwan government representatives, political affairs commissioner Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
'We know how hard the work ahead of us is,' Biden said.
But we also know that we can face the challenge, because, as I said before, democracy is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said: 'As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be a buffer and force against authoritarianism and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest.'
The second day of the Democratic Summit focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening remarks that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: 'Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy.'
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all that we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.”
Rogan Josh also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: 'Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose access to the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not recognized the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values.
And this is the reason for our failure.
That's also why we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down to defeat false information.
On the second day of the "Summit on Democracy", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that have been identified as serious human rights violators, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken and uploaded the photos to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
Originally it was #NUMBER#
Anyway, I'm not calling.
Not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
Waiting for you that long
No, I haven't received the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
A meal waited for an hour and a half.
Nothing sent from #PRS_ORG#.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the salivating chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that's close to it first to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often correlates with the degree of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones, these "entry level" ones are actually industrial garbage.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and the vibration is very big, the hard ball can't hold up, and it's difficult for the experts to control.
The logic and subtext behind it is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy something expensive, so let's get you a cheap racket and you'll play it twice and never play again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come to me to buy expensive things, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough so good rackets are not expensive. A new one is 500-600, and a second-hand one is 200. Isn't it great to have the enjoyment of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery time.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Postponement
Thank you.
So, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Is the previous one no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but there were many missing items and the salted chicken was also raw.
#PRS_ORG# is asking me to pick up something without any explanation, please cancel it.
My order is for delivery, there is no option for self-collection.

Actually, there are a lot of considerations for girls with slightly plump bodies when it comes to dressing up.
A girl with a fuller body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the thicker part of the thigh.
Short skirts will reveal the fat on the legs.
Being too tall gives a person a short and chubby feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three sections, top, skirt and long socks, in different colors, it will give you a more elongated look and make you appear taller naturally.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover your body fat, and a noble and elegant black skirt is the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeable.
The more universal the better, and the colors shouldn't be too bright either.
To avoid people noticing your legs and feet and getting the impression of obesity.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with fine grids), choose soft printed trumpet skirts, and match them with a drape neck top, which can cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls very well.
Of course, there is also a certain finesse to chubby girls wearing short skirts.
For a chubby girl wearing a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make her chubby figure look taller.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the hottest pairing for summer!
If you are top-heavy but have slim legs, we recommend choosing a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts will be slimming, more suitable for chubby girls, and the top should be tighter to create a layered look that will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even chubby MM can try it.
Chubby girls can also pull off a fashionable look.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly chubby girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in dressing, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "slightly fat girl" earlier😄

Girl as target for sister's fundraising: "It's better to think of it as flesh and blood injury" - Xinhua Net
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on friends circle.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move to raise money for her sister, but such behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "arrow target" fundraising accused of warning
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written in black ink on the board. Another board in front of her has her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc. written on it.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens thought it was a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers at that time."
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the 'human target' was crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl was on the side shouting, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But due to the need for over 300,000 in treatment costs, they resorted to this action as a way to raise funds in the short term.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were present, one as a target and one as a helper, but neither of them participated. No one was found shooting arrows, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bow and arrow used did not belong to the control category.
The responsible person said, "This kind of fundraising for show is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.
What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can be absolutely unbeatable in many projects: carrying bricks, business trips, and all-nighters are part of a project manager's daily life, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are a given.
Seemingly a joke article, it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, behind which is a lack of strength in current project management work.
People engaged in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) registrations each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2 per cent of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing year by year in the past decade, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does obtaining a PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners have stated that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to practice them; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on; unclear member division of labor, and "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor cross-departmental assistance and communication, making it difficult to advance the project...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It has brought the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
The R&D Project Manager Bootcamp Online Course is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods from R&D-type enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, resulting in more efficient operations for the business.
To get an idea of what other students think of the course, here is what they say: The course is not only delivered by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios, for a thorough and easy-to-understand professional explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students apply the learning content to specific work after class.

Jiexin advocated rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The variety of discounts and coupons, the eye-catching live streaming of goods, once again let consumers benefit greatly, this wave of consumption on the one hand makes people marvel at the strength of national consumption, on the other hand, we have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Ahead of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large disparities in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve basic financial literacy.
Older and younger generations have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will remain the focus of sustained attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is quite different from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their happy life with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to promote the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the years, CSC has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has been subtly guiding the consumption needs of young people through various forms of cooperation with top domestic universities and innovative practice competitions, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and overconsumption, and avoid the pitfalls of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Plan your spending carefully and make timely payments as appropriate.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse effect on future economic life such as car purchase and house purchase.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
Going forward, Credit China will continue to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, helping the public to enhance their financial knowledge, cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer finance partner that can be trusted for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies' embargo on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab states have imposed a blockade on land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, when the Gulf States signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore their relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar first.
The Gulf Arab States' resolution of differences to restore relations with Qatar was driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 kilometre long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses signed 13 cooperation MOUs worth $30 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf States coincided with negotiations between Iran and major world powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab States for its perceived inability to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf States have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear programme as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to contain Iran &apos; s activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its objective is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors for slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC Summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar was resolved.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the GCC unity, and to propose measures that will enable its members to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in XinShan District!
This car that our team has brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Priced at nearly two million Ringgit, with road tax of tens of thousands Ringgit per year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
The editor doesn't know either, but the data says that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while the editor's Myvi is still at 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body, and the glass-covered 6.5 V12 engine perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
You don't need to say too much about the car models, just Google it yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give you!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool)
RM1 for 1km (the driver doesn't care at all).
Practice getting on and off the vehicle, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise was so loud that it made you deaf as soon as you got off (but it was still awesome).
The car is too big, so it will be too narrow to park in a normal parking space, I'm afraid it will be hit by the door of the car next to it when it opens!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road (said by the editor himself, not related to the car owner, haha)
Everyone don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to take videos of their beloved cars, please contact us!
More car information you don't know about, at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involving a crash worth millions of dollars in value!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, millions of dollars worth of Porsche 911s and Chirons were destroyed in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonating the University Spirit with the Times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been essential for the development of politics, economics, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our universities, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
Currently, the trend of information technology and internationalization in higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and global competition in education, technology and talents is intensifying. Higher education, as an important &quot;supply side&quot;, is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Development of World-Class Universities and Disciplines has not only demonstrated the confidence and determination of China in its transition from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having firm goals, confidence in the path and confidence in capabilities, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and quality of school running; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand and enhance the image; third, the institutional advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to catch up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to recognize that the construction of world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, and each school must highlight its own personality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
School characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowments of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our education: (1) We emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science, education and industry, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; (2) We emphasize the convergence of disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; (3) We emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of &quot;Seeking Truth and Innovation&quot;, the shared values of &quot;Diligence, Virtue, Clarity, and Pragmatism&quot;, and the latest expression of the Zhejiang Spirit of &quot;Absorbing the Rivers and Seas, Cultivating True Virtue, Opening Up the World and Building Our Nation&quot; all constitute the Zhejiang Spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, embodying the mentality of "using the talents of the world for me"; "Qizhen Houde" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving the cultivation of virtue and tempering of character; "Kaiwu Qianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research innovation, and reform and development, as well as innovation; "Shu Wo Bangguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission shouldered by the cause of higher education in this era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, national spirit stimulate each other, so as to realize the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly leaving the scene, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a total of more than US$3 billion to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, close to that of "King of Glory".
On 6 August this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The heat of Axie Infinity is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just a single role, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This agency is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing the news about my friend's stock was the choice of industry for investment targets, namely that one should first choose industries with large growth potential, with a market size of at least 1000 billion; secondly, choose industries with good future growth potential, considering those industries that will reach their peak growth in the next 3-5 years; and lastly, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right", which means to do things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to deepen in the current field or to expand in the lateral field (strategic thinking); on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set up the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has become the official currency of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On 14 November 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua News
On May 23rd, over 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu Kong said that the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria for top American universities had doubled in the past decade, but the proportion of Asians in these three top universities had remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been engaging in "long-term, sustained, and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yu-Kong introduced that a research conducted by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asian applicants had the lowest admission rate relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also showed that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, with Yale University and Brown University having implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua reporters that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the appeal was joined by Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhoutou Town, Yuyao from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the property owner, Lin, on the details of the purchase of the factory, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer twice, and both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay of the signing of the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two sides were unable to reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, paying the deposit, and preparing the payment, all that was left was to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
The court, after hearing the case, found that the parties had failed to sign a formal contract, and that the fault could not be attributed solely to the defendant; it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, and therefore the penalty clause for the return of the deposit should not apply, and the defendant should not be liable for the breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
The plaintiff appealed after the first-instance judgement.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgement.
[Lawyer Reminder] Exercise necessary diligence in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer must exercise due diligence, such as verifying the ownership information of the house and whether the house is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democracy Summit" was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of democracy, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese Government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused devastating consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with 111 global leaders invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have been voices of criticism both internationally and domestically in the US, such as those questioning the invitation of some authoritarian-leaning leaders, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, with some suspecting that the real intention of the Biden administration in organizing the summit was not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Scholz, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth gaps becoming increasingly serious," and that democracy in the US is a "rich man's game" built on a capitalist foundation.
In his remarks, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be a buffer and a bulwark against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, &quot;We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time.&quot;
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces sustained and worrying challenges".
The US side committed to launching a one-year action plan following the Summit, including a US$ 424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy worldwide and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems prior to the physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Ok, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the way to drink Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world at present, and Red Label Whisky has won the gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't it be a waste of its smoothness?
So how do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor will give you a brief introduction.
Red Label Whisky Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is blended from around 35 Scotch whiskies, with the characteristic richness and smokiness of traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
Rich and refreshing on the palate, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on the rocks or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red Label whisky enters the domestic market, and in order to suit the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky + cola or Sprite or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks become a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize the acidity, can bring pleasure visually, adding to the drink to dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red Label Whiskey + Sliced Lemons + Rock Sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Red Fong has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky, everyone can try as a reference, I hope my introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How College Exams Can Make Both "Geeks" and "Dummies" Happy - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and requesting that the difficulty of the exams be increased, the types of questions be changed, and that the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In university campuses, students come from all walks of life with varying abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation highly diverse.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics is bound to involve different perceptions.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will certainly create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass by cramming before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, the "slacker" can pass the exam without much effort and even get a high score; the "nerd" who never skips classes, does all the homework and takes good notes, but does not get much higher scores in the exam, is in a "strange situation".
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without reason in reflecting the problems in college entrance examinations, and it is believed that this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, kudos should be given to the three students who wrote the letters.
In fact, those who have been to university know that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try to get exam questions from teachers, bargain for the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets and ask teachers for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of a university's examination pass or fail is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teachers, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to specialize, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
Without a doubt, whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content that university exams will examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic disciplinary theories and basic common sense, and the scope of variation in terms of knowledge points is not large and is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics that was taught in universities 20 years ago is still being taught, and is still a priority."
But the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, examination questions are usually composed by a question-setting team and compiled by senior subject teachers, and the marking of the examination is also participated by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level should be made, so that the test questions can be dynamically grasped in terms of difficulty and type, so as to not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types of questions.
Examinations are the driving force of university education, and with the corresponding preparation plans that students have for the type of exams, the effectiveness of university education will be affected in the long run.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values the student's suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Requiring teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course-ending examinations for self-inspection, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Mechanically addressing issues such as single-type question types and repeated questions is an issue that university examination offices need to face, and of course corresponding systems need to be put in place. However, the effort lies in daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. Not only must they understand the teaching content, but they must also understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a virtuous interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both "academic elites" and "academic underachievers" to get what they need.
If we can't change the store location, can we switch to delivery?
So I don't need to give more money then?
The order of the colleague has been delivered.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time properly, and the consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later chose a weekend with good weather to take pictures.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I ever put on makeup formally, wow I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were super patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix it if anything was slightly off.
The photographer was also very funny, and felt happy after a day of taking pictures.
When selecting photos, because I had seen many cases online, I was not willing to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were selecting photos, really, there was no intention to add photos, directly the 24 photos in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lanlan sent them to me, I saw two of them weren't very good, they immediately helped me to fix them again.
Flipping through the photos my sister took before, I feel that our photos are really satisfactory, simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Fu Ren to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for your sincere wishes for your happiness and bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Sabah 11th News) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper, birth certificates could not be issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of those affected has reached 3200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Amunus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and would receive their certificates when the anti-counterfeit paper arrived next week.
He explained at the briefing in response to a question from an online media outlet about a 10-month delay in the printing of the Sabah newspaper.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah Berita was different from other regions, and therefore could not be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Kaluamunus revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was subsequently handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The board will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be delivered to the applicant in two (2) working days (20 December)."
"We will inform the petitioner to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates this year to date.
From around 7 o'clock until now
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said they're ready.

The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in two months' time, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, presenting the world with a simple, safe and exciting event.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation in winter sports events preparation and athlete training, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can "move forward together", and wishing the Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes good results in Beijing.
Prior to the meeting, the BHOC held the 10th Annual Best Athlete Award Ceremony, with Ji Ping as a special guest to present the award for the Best Young Athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The activity site is looping the Beijing Winter Olympics promotional video.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set "buffer zone" The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening the epidemic prevention and control of port cities - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that people leaving port cities on land borders (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) in the near future must have a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people arriving in port cities on land borders must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the period for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to 15 March 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that eligible port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
Officials from the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
Implementing differentiated management policies in different regions, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to move the control point forward, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent months, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing becoming a formality, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items at each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do the work of prevention and control without slackening, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice stressed that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the livelihood security work, publicize and facilitate the livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the potential risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectural cities, leagues) and directly-administered cities where open land, water and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing Truth - Xinhua News
(Video Source: YouTube)
On 11 December, a short documentary on YouTube called "Killing Machines" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war. For 20 years, they have been engaged in a bloody war, killing innocent people and committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to launch airstrikes on civilian locations such as hospitals and schools distorts humanity and creates death squads.
Over the past 20 years, US forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up &quot;black prisons&quot; to inflict various forms of torture and humiliation on &quot;suspects&quot;.
Acts of inhumanity have stirred up even more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" has been "more terror, less terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video, let's together uncover the truth of the US's bloodthirsty slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Accidentally seeing the following article, from the perspective of business and the period of preservation, why does this customer want the logistics company in the bonded zone to help with canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company, here the following words may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder factories and interacted with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone will surely ask: why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a can is two years or longer?
Or ask: why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or mom-level, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, raw materials are the same, it's just that people think expensive is good.
There are also consumers who, with this mentality, eat and then respond that the taste or flavor of the canned food is different!
Now I'll tell everyone why the hearing aid is expensive, where is the value?
Why is there such a big price difference if their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag is priced too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or even no profits, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have had a great increase in the pricing of their listening devices to secure their profit margin.
So most manufacturers are pushing for tins rather than bags.
And then there are the millions, even billions, of advertising fees that manufacturers spend every year - where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
So with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
So manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and they are listening devices, and their prices are also constantly rising, in fact this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to gain higher profits, in fact the cost of their raw materials increase at most by 3-4 yuan.
There are also some brands that resort to unscrupulous means to promote their products, by hooking up with doctors in hospitals and having them assist in the promotion of the products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operation methods, in fact, this practice is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of canned and bagged goods is the same after opening, it just means that bagged goods are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out too.
Cancel immediately, the things he sent from #PRS_ORG# must be cold.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of success-related books.
Many of the success books of today preach the 'best principle' - that is, assume or imply that you can 'do it', and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, skipping over the actually most important and fundamental aspect of 'how to do it'.
So these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This 'best principle' is undeniably 'right', but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180 degree turn" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly a case of self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ears of those who are conservative and reject change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word &quot;transformation&quot;, reluctant to take action, and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a &quot;transformation&quot; decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid representation of this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" principle is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the capabilities of the average person, leaving the majority of people "sighing at the gate".
Perhaps, the &quot; second-best principle &quot; is a way that could enable more ordinary people to take the path to relative success.
The core of the 'Second Best Principle' is 'lowering the threshold' - it encourages a theory of 'accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory', that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In any case, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes a greater chance of success.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
All in all, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, but in the end it only really motivates a few; while the "second best principle" is what effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.

The resource endowment of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tonnes compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tonnes, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of the protection in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Kangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive human hunting, the degradation of the environment of the naked carp breeding water area, etc., the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake in 2002 was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of China's Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage", and the resource reserve of Qinghai Lake naked carp has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23 percent to the restoration of the naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED Credit Card to order food over $180.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to put in the bag, the weather is cold.
Can I ask, is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Wondering if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been 1 hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
Just saw an article about taking leave, it was too long.
Give a science lesson to the unknowing man.
Most girls experience their first period suddenly at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, it will come once a month regularly under the premise of physical health.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to come earlier (suddenly several days earlier).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it can last for several days with 24-hour bleeding. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen when the menstrual period just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but it is not useful to take it after the menstrual cramps start.
Due to excessive uterine congestion and prostaglandin release before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the time of your cycle, and you suddenly get a stomachache, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared portion, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify here, the sanitary napkin does not need to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed once, the longest is eight hours).
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the fluctuation of hormones during ovulation can make one's mood unstable, which is really unfortunate, as the body trips itself up.
But official crime rate data shows that women still have a high capacity to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, it comprises shed endometrium.
The endometrium of the uterus is thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus being a house, building the house (thickening of the endometrium) every month to prepare for guests, no guests coming, tearing it all down (menstruation discharging) and building a new house the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding for a few days every month, and abdominal and back pain, who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Let's thank our mothers for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things for women were suppressed before, society brainwashed women that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting, finds the preparation of a woman's body for the creation of life disgusting, and doesn't think it should be said in public, girls stand up, don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't understand it very well, don't be so ungrateful and don't have such an attitude. How can they face their own mother with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary napkins, they really work.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending wrong gifts is disappointing.
Order extra food for the kids.
Hoping that the store will check the production even in the midst of its busyness.
Is the electric shock from the foot bath tub due to a leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect. Today, Gome's little editor will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of health care increases, foot baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a variety of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
In terms of related data, health-care appliances such as foot baths are selling well compared to traditional home appliances, but there are no specific industry standards for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up, to his surprise he found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, but even after returning the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the long-standing foot bath is now not having a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the setting of the highest temperature, applicable to which kind of people, and which kind of material to ensure safety.
But generally speaking, foot baths are not likely to have any electrical issues, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been poorly inspected before leaving the factory.
So choose a detachable foot bath when buying.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.
You can also take a pen and measure at the same time.
Thirteenth Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline View - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily December 10th News (Full Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a hundred billion tea industry.
The Vice-Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, Hou Shunli, and the Vice-Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum into the "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, Five Colors Tea".
Tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to strengthen, main tea producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase income.
The wind and water turn in turn, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua celebrated the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea expo on site, there are many highlights.
Newhua Red Tea adds a touch of red, infusing the connotation of tea culture, popular and hot in trading, and the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want it, as there is no place to park below, so he couldn't deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a basic principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called Tao, the below is called instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro (Meiji period) from the word "metaphysic".
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only concepts.
Metaphysical Naturalism, which refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any reference to God.
Mental philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research into human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong actions).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should adhere to) Applied Ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.) and Descriptive Ethics (collecting information about how people live, making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theory, but by investigating the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, all the moral factors that led to these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by such figures as Vala and Montaigne.
Part 2: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli, Modern Ethics (17-18th centuries, British Empirical Ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th centuries, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th centuries, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th centuries, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transitional Ethics (Non-Rationalist Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a branch of study that deals with the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our beloved family member, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted to this day.
Nowadays, the majority of the parents of the deceased have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It is your acts of kindness that have helped these struggling families get through the toughest of times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed - the Tiananmen Mothers group - a humanitarian relief effort that should have been long since concluded.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief overview of the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All American Chinese Democracy Alliance and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years until 2009, when all June Fourth orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the June Fourth Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund, which has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects came mainly from the campus and social donations of the year 64, from generous individual donations, and with the support of the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a gap of 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in 1989 in the name of June 4th.
During this time, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of the June 4th donation was for the consideration of the donors, who are indeed some retired elderly people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Mr. Ding's "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the refugees and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
We also express our gratitude and respect to those brave comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Thanks for the rabbit's review. Originally said that the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style, did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition from Dandan, your satisfaction can give us the power to continue to move forward, we will keep going!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend all the buddies to come!
Impeccable from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production.
The makeup artist is especially delicate, and will match a suitable makeup for you according to your style, and the cosmetics used are all top-brand ones.
Mr. Tian Liang doesn't need to be said, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats playing around.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to book half a year in advance. My colleague had their photos taken in Beijing and the finished product was just so-so.
Specially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is quite poor, feeling that this is also the case for most people, photographers Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production design, a fine team.
We and the people around us all praised it in unison.
I have recommended it to my best friend and she was equally delighted after seeing the negatives.
I hope such studios don't get buried, that more people discover them and shoot in their own style, rather than in a cookie-cutter way.
Many thanks to Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to fulfill the customer's wishes as long as they like us. Grateful for the acquaintance.
Sweet and caring assistants, and the lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, thank you all 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Little Universe. It's fate to meet you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is thousands of kilometers away. I'm glad to meet you. I'll have the chance to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you're planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have that idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you're planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a great option, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if it is not strong enough, the training institution is of no use, of course, some newly established training institutions have not got a particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, preferably from the students of the institution, since only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given any introduction about your own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with one's own situation.
Such as profession, age, language to be learned, and even in which city, these will all be related to the field you are learning or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time I personally suggest self-learning, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays there are many offline and online training institutions which are also quite good, but one, the cost of learning is high, and two, the time investment is quite large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-learning is very convenient; there are many learning resources on the Internet now that are free, or you can go to B station for a lot of training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through a brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some classic books that can be used in conjunction with video learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning is not too difficult, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, there are people to answer questions, and there is also help in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
Those are my thoughts, I didn't go into too much detail since I don't know your situation, if you have any other questions feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said 1 o'clock and I saw it in the App.
What is called
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall-mounted stove water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lighting, glass cleaning, professional sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thanks to those who silently give me thumbs up, strive hard for life, life is tiring but keep going.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, like and follow me, thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the results, we have to go through the process alone, when facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going, the road can be looked back on but cannot be walked back on...
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility; life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, that moment all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My Daily Work
Your Request, My Service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services help you do "net" what I can, serve the family.
Keep every family clean, set up a household management monument, serve in place, clean to the home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dull and dark if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance, just like life.
Doing it with care will lead to success, shaping it with precision will make it exquisite, we are serious about our craftsmanship.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to do anything in the current industries!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persist and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day is determined by the morning, all the good starts from the morning. Hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Good morning and keep a good mood all day.
When young, happiness is something to possess and be happy with; when grown up, happiness is a goal to reach and be happy with; when mature, happiness is found to be a mindset to understand and be happy with.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, go your own way; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live happily ever after!
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you cannot avoid it, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more difficulties will overwhelm you; if you face the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join forces to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennial - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is jointly curated by the Saudi Art Jeddah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennial covers nearly 12,000 m2 and spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as Experiment, Peripheral Thinking, Going Public, A Beautiful New World, and On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly sought after, some of which used recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Streams and Mountains in the Series Behind the Story" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Barry Barakat, Chief Executive of the Deriyye Biennial Foundation, said he hopes the Biennial will create an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative communities, and to strengthen interactions.
Fei Yu said, "The biennial's goal is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinated and Standardized Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continuously do a good job of employment assistance for people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help promote the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, the Rural Revitalization Department, and the Finance Department, mainly to unify the scope of objects for recruitment of personnel for rural public welfare posts at the grassroots level, fund management, post development, and post management.
The new regulations clearly stipulate that the setting of posts should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "setting posts on demand, assigning personnel according to posts, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement for work.
Furthermore, the new regulations specify the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public service posts, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public service posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for personnel placed in rural public service posts; and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public service posts.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can I cancel the order?
I reorder.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing has had its times of success in history, they have not lasted long, so they are short-lived because they shine brightly with a bit of sunshine and sweat with a sip of water; they are ambitious when they are successful and cling to others when they are defeated.
But realistically speaking, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, for me, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am concerned about his statements and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think counter-revolution is necessary, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people; political opportunists who try to take advantage of the situation are not rightists, they are scoundrels.
Let's chat some more.
The Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is to have a positive meaning for society, and the communists are willing to listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the communists have thrown away!
Recently I've seen some friends arguing with the villains and getting angry, which I think is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a lunatic, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the opponents and the left-wingers admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries scold you for five cents, when the left-wingers scold you for the right-wingers, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them to the point of obsession.
And as the ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually becomes a wicked dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom. China, from its historical and cultural innate genes, should be generally left-leaning.
The right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness and security.
Now the overall society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is affirmative and is estimated to continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just give it a thumbs up and it's done.
Nothing more to say, Flower is just that righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US's suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to simultaneously blockade China's chip industry, has directly resulted in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, thus causing a shortage of chaos in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phones rising in price, and almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to gain "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are starting to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to maintain global control over semiconductor control and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, as well as subsidizing US tech giants such as Intel, the old American tech giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field. Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up its chip foundry business.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply rooted in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is sure to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Morris Chang showed no interest in Intel's decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April, Zhang Zhongmou was astonishingly outspoken about Intel's move to invest in building a wafer fab, saying that it was quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer field was due to his lingering resentment towards the feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of US manufacturing, dominating the global peak and reigning supreme in the world of semiconductors.
By the 1980s, the world &apos; s high-end semiconductor chips had been held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, such models put a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to afford the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to specialize and cooperate in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then it would be possible to set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", without design, only providing OEM services for wafer manufacturing.
At the time, newly-founded TSMC was a small fry compared to Intel, the giant.
In order to get capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognized that Intel then looked down on wafer process services.
Surprisingly, the giants who once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services are now starting to do semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic that Intel entered the semiconductor foundry business.
Now, TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Don't wait anymore.

Come and see some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Taking three hot searches at random: "Dragon Boat Festival", "Kellogg's Price Increase", and "Hualala Incident", public opinion spread and peaked, then [the index declined] (smoothly) before eventually dissipating. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small hump will appear again.
They look identical to the Network Public Opinion Evolution Model that the Cyberspace Administration of China had previously displayed.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event to present a "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff" shape.
【Peak-shaped】refers to artificial heating, quickly rushing into the hot search list, causing public attention;【Sawtooth-shaped】refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list;【Cliff-shaped】refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and is ready to take on a new task and rush to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in the dozens of hot searches that appear on the list at the same time: which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones start wars, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones stir up emotions, which ones influence decisions, and black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, taking into account almost all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Communication is a science; without taking into account any subjective factors such as position and emotion, public relations will be nowhere to hide when only looking at objective data.
Everyone leaves a trace, and we dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries first discovered cases of Omicron Rho virus infection - Xinhua News
Beijing, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua reporters stationed abroad reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the OMKRON strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the virus on the 10th day.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailash Jugutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other is a local resident who tested positive for the virus on 30 November after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the virus.
These three persons are students who returned from abroad at the beginning of this month and, as they were all mild cases, were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government is intensifying its prevention and control efforts.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers aged 12 and above arriving by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had identified three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December, and identified three cases of infection.

Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain.
Your rider told me the address was too far
Great Beauty 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: No. 156 Huan Cheng Nan Road, 12th Floor, Happiness Home
It was initially a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to take a look initially and my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
Come into the store and start a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even measure the house; they were able to give me a quote that my 135 sq. ft. house could be done for 70,000, and they roughly showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that once you get to the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience and fight them in court).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you could get if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, in a moment of impulse, paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service points charge more than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, they didn't explain anything before asking me to sign the contract.
When I went to get my money back they were very experienced, they had a special little team to deal with you.
No matter what, biting the bullet is the customer's problem and they are entirely blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and there are many details, don't want to say one by one are tears, in short don't choose them, because my friend's house renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn, they were the original scamming decorators, now they changed to something beautiful, and now it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
So everyone don't choose such a crappy decoration company.
In the future, everyone should do more research and consult more when choosing, because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask a question to the merchant, please login or register first.
Commercial reviews of any kind are strictly prohibited, see Merchant Listing Statement for details.

It's so scary, please cancel the order if you don't make it within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Alright, so don't cancel this conversation, if the money isn't refunded within 5 to 10 days, there will be consequences.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

Sky appointment | Gemini meteor shower 14th will usher in the greatest - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12 December (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on 14 December. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing Astronomy Enthusiasts Anjiu in Qinghai on 13 December 2018.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an expert in astronomical popularization, said that just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A striking feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, colorful, and there are plenty of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower on 13 December 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
Astronomical forecasts show that the peak of the Gemini meteor shower this year will arrive around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions, with the radiant directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people with its 'falling petals', but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, with a full moon, which would interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon would set in the latter part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower would rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight when the moon sets, but be sure to dress warmly.
How can we observe more meteors as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets, and observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there is no need to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose wide-angle, large aperture lenses, use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and continuity, a tripod, spare batteries and a shutter release cable are also essential.
Xiulipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic starter should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products designed specifically for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of global shipments and sales of laser TVs has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, the sales growth of laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020 and continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the success of the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The CESTI Saei Laboratory and the ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College, through a rigorous comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population, obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health is increasingly being taken seriously, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It makes sense certainly.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, with little space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach 2000 lumens or more.
Combined with lower heat generation and less damage to the equipment, the life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, etc., which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not talking about artificial demand, but the product of demand segmentation, in terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dish of audio-visual players, if you want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, after weighing, you can judge for yourself, just afraid to listen to one-sided words.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle short-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block out some ambient light, micro-structured Flanders screens are used, at a high cost; an 80-inch would cost roughly the same as a 65-inch LCD.
Also, I really hate it when projector manufacturers use "good for your eyes" as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that your eyes can see is direct light, and if you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it either. Even LCD TVs are "directly diffused", isn't the ceiling lit up when you turn on the TV?
And if the projection screen isn't diffuse, it won't be able to form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high gain screens was precisely overlooked, where a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, that's really uncomfortable.
Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Select Quality Store No Branches Yet
After adding WeChat to book the date, the lady sent me the available time slots and replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, we decided to start the makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props, guide the action, and be very meticulous about the details before taking the photos.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, the style I got wasn't what I wanted, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help to select the photos, communicate the post-style, and feel very attentive.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, waiting for the effect~
I won the second time in the photography-type Bawang Meal activity~ Most of the clothes in the whole field can be selected for shooting.
Finally chose a black chiffon skirt, experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer was the younger brother of the post-95s generation, who felt a bit inexperienced. We hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.

Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose the clothes and wedding dress. They were patient even though I tried on three or four sets. After choosing, I had my makeup done for a long time and the service attitude was good. Later, they taught me how to pose for the shoot. The only downside was that the photos made my face look big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received it in three or four days and it didn't seem much different from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup stations, inside is a photography studio.
The service is both friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a retake.
Experience: The styling may have been a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily no-eyebrow makeup.
The photos came in ten days, but the photoshopped effect wasn't very satisfactory, it still felt very obvious that the double eyelids were pasted on.
Because I wasn't sure what style to go for, I tried two sets and after much deliberation, I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After picking out the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favourite ones and the little brother said it would be finished within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfactory~
It's been 3 days without a response... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and then you charge me the monthly fee after you investigate?
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the Insurance Brokerage Regulatory Regulations (Revised 2015), to become an insurance broker, three key words must be met: shareholders, promoters have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict, and can be summarized as having the strength, being approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating insurance companies and banks nationwide), having good shareholder conduct, and as an insurance broker, the insured does not need to question whether the umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of business outlets and the cost of business personnel salaries, the Internet products generally have a higher cost performance ratio, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
In terms of professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, as insurance is an industry with a high degree of professionalism required, and many internet product customers can self-insure, which can lead to a lot of misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can lead to a lot of potential claims issues and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing on "Tencent Weibao" (just like Little Umbrella, an internet insurance brokerage platform) and was very responsible in informing everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but it is the people who are not reliable, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misdirection.
For example, marketing strategies such as "1 yuan insurance for 6 million, free mobile phone with purchase of insurance, and free 6 million critical illness coverage" are not wrong, but they are avoiding the main point. They do not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, but the following months will be charged according to the normal rate, ranging from tens to hundreds of yuan. Many customers do not understand what they have bought after paying for one or two years.
Thinking that you can spend one dollar and the insurance company will pay out six million (the world is like a pie falling from the sky).
The free mobile phone is only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term, if it is only relied on without other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 can do nothing, can't solve the problem, and life will start to be barefoot afterwards.
Misleading internet insurance sales are currently being strictly punished by the state.
So all in all, the platform is fine, the product is fine, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster consider comprehensively, in fact, many offline insurance broker companies have more products, customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers with offline products, and each person saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, served nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast three companies for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer has been helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can complete all the insurance procedures by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, nor does the insurance advisor, and all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although there may be no "ceremony" to the purchase of online insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telephone sales" type of assembly line job, but such buying of insurance can also have a fatal flaw, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and choose an "intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider just left it at the door and then the person left.
Also sent wrong.
Your rider has picked up my takeout at #NUMBER# but I'm still being told it's waiting.
The delivery rider had received my takeout at 19:25 but still refused to depart.
After I buy, do I need any other takeout?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm ordering for one.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene issues.

No problem, remember no need to arrange for reshipment, I have already purchased elsewhere, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have opposed any form of slander and abuse from the past to the present, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If not looking at parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to the posts with sarcastic comments, to your attempts to post my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some of my subtle, humiliating words, looks, body, good upbringing, and other bed-strawberry-planting and plugging messages on Facebook with your so-called friends. I... just forget it.
Later I received more messages from friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and making sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news of the police report, you didn't calm down at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your drawing or continue to post all offensive comments.
Right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my looks and figure need no comment from you.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself like that for fame.
My friend asked me, are you alright?
I said it was okay, but you don't believe me.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Only those without basic decency would choose to harm any woman in such a way, whether in the workplace, in society, in politics or in business.
I believe justice lies in the hearts of men.
I have taken some of the messages for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you with the post you made yourself.
I can only say you are a civilized public enemy.
A smile of understanding
Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics revolving around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the face of and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yangtze River Mainstream Achieves Full Coverage of Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Zone - Xinhua News
The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th, according to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on December 11th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was listed and put into operation on the 8th.
Thus far, the water green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Zone is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River Green Shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
It is reported that the Marine Green Comprehensive Service Zone is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and crews, helping them to solve urgent and difficult problems.
The two water green comprehensive service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, realizing the "one-time mooring and multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Rare Visit of Most Powerful Weapon to Guam - Doview - Pro-China Communist Media Doview reported the latest news on China-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, a satellite detected the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9.
The Babuyan Channel connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea is a strategic stronghold in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expecting the Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising the Pacific, there is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The Lincoln also hosted the first F-35C carrier squadron, the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Rare Visit to Guam with the Most Powerful Weapons On January 17, 2022, US Navy Carrier-based Transport Aircraft CMV-22B Flight Route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Guam Naval Base last Saturday (January 15).
Analysis suggests that this is a signal to allies and adversaries in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region as three US aircraft carriers converge around China for a rare visit to Guam.
This was the first visit by a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US has assembled its three aircraft carriers around China, the most powerful weapon in rare visits to Guam, and China has been building a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea islands in recent years.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomer" the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes land-based launch silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta, with a market cap evaporating of $251 billion, and Zuckerberg's response of "facing unprecedented competition", what could be the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., whatever the functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustments to its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether they allow the app to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of which is uncertain, but it is there).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta earns at least 10 per cent of its revenue annually from China, mainly from companies doing business in the country.
Meta has approximately hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money spent is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money off of Byte just two years ago.
All the agents in the country are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels was not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets are not only looking at income, but more importantly, at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the 'metaverse'.
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization of the Metaverse has a longer cycle, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a tough period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of $10-20 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at Facebook, with no real safe harbor compared to other internet and high-tech companies.
Although his several social apps have a high daily active user count and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of a grand unified universe, which is out of reach in the short term, is very risky for Facebook, which is why Zuckerberg is constantly changing the company's name and looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues is wrong, a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
