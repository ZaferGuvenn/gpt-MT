From my point of view, the literature program was shaped by Balzac-era women based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
But the psychology and sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
The "Prestige Micro-Package": Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft side is by a natural latex slab.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is well ventilated naturally, as is coir coconut.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is preserved.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in practice the mattress has a longer service life.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Get an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress – it is recommended to support optimal spine alignment during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the doorstep, and cutlets are still sizzling on the stove, mom is flustered and mopping the floor.
Lord, yes, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house again.
A week before the holiday you buy groceries, two days of cooking, and one day of cleaning up afterwards.
And what about the guests?
They are doing well, and cake is a must too.
Ever since then I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I make them treats and bake just for fun very often.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in summer or autumn 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
Ulrich Weigelt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This is on Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Wiegel hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be done "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
Furthermore, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
Moreover, the new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Proceeding from this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
BioNTech and Pfizer's research showed that with two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging for an acceleration of vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, as Zalzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling in this regard," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for bottom fishing, not just for casting.
These vibes have a higher relative weight than their close-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top smoothie made of strong and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib it demonstrates quite an aggressive game.
Often the most effective is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
Furthermore, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander and large perch in winter, especially in mid-winter when pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib can be used to tease a passive catfish that does not even react to bait.
When casting Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This lure is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with the line and braided cords even of large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or roach in addition to uniform current and "step" sometimes with "tapping" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch the treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, consequently, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with equal success both on relatively small and on quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, it was reported that there are 7 thousand Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri.
Currently there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
"They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt)," - Anadolu agency quotes him.
Haled al-Mishri also stated that Russian mercenaries are trying to seize the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save attendance
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirt, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as supplies of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in either the military or the corporate registry, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind that earlier the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve the decision on December 13th.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto serves as the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and head of state elections from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "in Syria we defended and restored peace there", "the decision on the "Nord Stream-2"", "the whole world was scared of the cool weapons", "we gave away Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are mentioned in the study of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Government of Dubai completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services also became digital only.
The Government of Dubai announced a complete rejection of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, all Dubai government entities' internal and external document circulation will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The reform affected all sectors without exception: health care, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities calculated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and exports of cars in Turkey have fallen below the 2020 level.
Turkey's car production and exports sharply declined in November due to the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November 115 thousand cars were released from the factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive trend compared to last year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which depreciated by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB entities received a deferral on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov told about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in order to fulfill the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses" on April 9, 2021," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the deferral of loan payments provided for banks and microfinance organizations to grant deferral of payments on loans issued to SME subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, before 1 April 2021, for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's statement could have specified a different period of deferment of payments.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's commissions and other payments, were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, applications for payment deferral on loans from 603 borrowers of SMEs were received by second-tier banks, of which 553 SMEs received deferral for a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
"Microfinance organizations submitted applications for deferment to 131 MSB subjects, of which deferment was granted to 95 subjects for the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the "okmirone" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "Okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation, he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than usual, their antibodies were not cut off during mutations - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is often the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s just get away with a cold.
The immune response of the young man is completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows," concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case often only the symptoms can be suppressed - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of an underlying problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarteners, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, to Moscow 24.
An immense gratitude to the author for this article.

Immunologists put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid-19.
The authors of the study examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that the fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fat tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who had died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
Probably SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia.
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin noted that most commonly, dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disturbances, and deficiencies of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role', he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of WHO-related diseases, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities requiring memory and logic involvement.

Egypt returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out were registered in archives.
The department staff are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the experts "track auctions worldwide and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural treasures are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol for help in locating the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held an auction in which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approx. 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned off since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively striving for the repatriation of illegally exported ancient monuments from the country in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a distinct people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or customers.
The Bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client which was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have shifted to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse officially does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is on his own, but is well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over 60 poems were written in the year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
And the main success - at the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No modern-day Sergei Alexandrovich poets have been honored with such an honor, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya Tolstaya, he had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind whistling?
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September.
Alcohol rots your brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had deteriorated greatly, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
The lullabies are repeated more often, nervous breakdowns.
And the cause is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Aleksandrovich, no reliable documents remain.
For example, in May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Duncan, was treating his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Petrus Gannushkin (Esenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
There is plenty of evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this matter, and police reports scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly stayed with his friend, the imazhynist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his relatively good income, Esenin never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg, instead staying in rented apartments, hotels, or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
"He would only come to sleep, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, spraying the whole sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (where Prohibition was in effect, but Dungan had brought a substantial supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I was already at the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because loneliness gnawed at me.

And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely".
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school?
Well she will have a tail.
So what?
They will retake it.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The relevant statement by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many points around the world".
As kp.ru reported earlier, the European Union has implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they have declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk in response imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka's Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
Velvet jackets were dominant at 2021 social events.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion statement was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice followed, first wearing a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony that did not conform to the royal dress code, and then choosing a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was adopted by Lionel Messi.
The player arrived to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts from the service reported to "Gazeta.Ru", their products were purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, navy blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury velvet blazer segment this season, almost all brands are represented - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, in which ambassador of the brand Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also serve for a shorter period of time accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not the model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It's also suitable for occasions where the dress code is 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie'."
Another important criterion that allows one to make a choice in favour of the velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should have the right advanced company with enough money," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel". - Owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events, where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with arrows, monotone shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it is a "leader from among those who organize the event, then - yes, such a thing would be appropriate".
If the employee is of a lower rank and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase “not according to Senka’s hat”, - the editors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion think.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so rehearsed.
And has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of the people around.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion dollar investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in demand - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And who was flying then?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots for "missing" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good cause.
I didn't see any attractive people in the photos in the article.
Mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Maybe if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, then they won't sit next to them, most likely.
But only because of mental disorders and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he voluntarily extols the virtues of slavery and praises his kind and good master is a lackey, a sycophant.
The immunologist said that vaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" coronavirus strain.
Vaccination within four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Under the old strains, that was the norm, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - in four," said the expert, calling for parallel to the vaccination campaign to take up revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If someone has had two doses and a booster, or they have had the disease and been vaccinated, or been vaccinated and then had the disease, then they have 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "massive consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The "Big Seven" countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) released a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "Russia's military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the increasing military build-up of Russia and its aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement reads.
The Ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments to transparency in military activities," as President Biden mentioned during his video call with President Putin of Russia on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to settle the conflict in the east of Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also declared.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and a serious price to pay in response," they warn.
We affirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation for our collective and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world GDP, and made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron-strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than for other types of illness.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omikron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
The scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omikron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev.
The Head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking the purchase of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on guns, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government had explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbas, despite the "Russian occupation" of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to be a "technical partner" for Ukraine, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.
Sergey NOSOV 2, no, poor vision has nothing to do with it.

No, you are an illiterate person.
And for a philologist it is a disgrace.

This is really delicious.
I add a bit more chopped onion and a green apple to it.
Give it a try.
Recently, the zombie yeller shouted that car production is experiencing an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors.
The screen displayed a table showing which country produces what percentage of these semiconductors (presumably microcontroller chips).
Russia was not on that list.
That's it!
It is profitable in the US with their expensive labor force, but not profitable for us in Russia!

I feel sorry for her, she is not with us.
If I had seen her kindly, everything could have been different.
But besides hatred, gossip and scandals, there is nothing particularly memorable.
I feel sorry for her, she lived a life of bitterness.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.
The Foreign Ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
Participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the reinforcement of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
&quot;Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs&quot;, the statement published on the UK government website reads.
The G7 ministers and the High Representative of the EU noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "serious consequences" for Russia in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
"G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the buildup of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were held in the "Norman format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke out for dialogue in the "Normandy format" in Ukraine.
The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Maria Zakharova stated that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have exposed themselves as unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Revealed ways to get stolen money back from online stores.
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when the bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"Under the rules established by the payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after purchase.
Moreover, if the perpetrator used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021 there were 11 thousand appeals on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Belarus border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he will be calling on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin declared that it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disputes.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violated EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the US, did not take on any public commitments to stop the "Nord Stream-2" project in case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials informed members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking Congressional staffer reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was reconfirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more closely.

And I know these apartments very well and can see how it was re-planned perfectly.
Let everything be good for them.
It always amazes me when people write about ways to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
Do you wash them once a year for Easter or something, so you have to scrub them off?
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Culture wants to grant writers residencies.
The future Support Fund for Russian Writers will be given federal property inherited from the USSR Union of Writers and the USSR Literary Fund.
On its basis, writing residencies will be created, the Parliamentary Gazette in Mintzifry reported, which will become a founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing a draft Presidential Decree establishing the Fund for the Support of Russian Literati.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be entrusted to take care of, including the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Litfund.
"A significant number of immovable property objects, previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR, have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writers' village of Peredolkino, the village of Komarovo in Leningrad region and others," the press service of the Ministry of Culture told the Parliamentary Gazette.
The Decree Project stipulates in the Fund's charter that it "is established to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
&quot;Creating conditions for creative activity&quot; means creating writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity&quot;, the Ministry of Culture explained to our publication.

Doctors warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.

The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific supervisor of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev in an interview with URA.RU said that Russians now often take anticoagulants randomly and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and starting to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And upon preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that faithful Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of packets with money and checks under the insulation.
He handed over the church find and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say: "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the find is related to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount, as the term of the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in a donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers here," as it is written here.
There are people richer than her, but not all of them act so brazenly and provocatively as this lady.

“The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flows,” noted Barrozo.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists infected with coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
A comprehensive protection plan against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Science, Honoured Worker of Science of Russia Anatoly Altshtein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing an injection and applying a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, a large number of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
Inside after vaccination we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet about double vaccination," the medic said.
The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the combined intranasal and injection vaccination is the possibility of becoming a non-carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that case the body's defense, presumably, should be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the dog (who has been dead for a long time) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the parrot was trained and generally smart.
He chose my society and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I held back many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200K were running away (in Pomsk), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccination opponents continue
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and government plans to make Covid vaccination compulsory.
From February of next year, non-EU citizens will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding signs that said "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID-certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports in some regions of the country was taken in the face of an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The demonstration started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
The group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

WHO has already detected "omicron" in sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the new strain of coronavirus, "Omikron," has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of dissemination of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This was despite it only becoming actively spread from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern over the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had stated that the Omikron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The same conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of those affected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people with the coronavirus in the Kingdom at the moment, and up to 10 thousand according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omikron" strain, and at the peak hospitals will be taking more than 2 thousand people daily.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent researches the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than with other types of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "Omikron" is still unknown - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Centre has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.

Or hands on the waist?
Curious Bunny, you are right, communication online is quite different, it's easy and relaxed, but in person there's nothing to say.
And seeing someone in person, maybe it's not what you expected, didn't catch on - hence the attitude.
When one meets their person, then the views will change.
And again, Soviet time is called "the time of the beasts".
Yes, people believed in God much more honestly back then than they do today.
And we were practically raised according to God's laws (love for the neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is today's ideology - money at any cost.
There is little (if any) faith in the likes of Globus, but even if so, the time of the gods arrived in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg (or rather Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe this is related to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we seem to be attending more funerals.
Lara Angelskaja, yes drop it!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, squirming, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
Too bad they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but no bumper cars!
Yes, and for what?
Did Brother push him, not calculating the force?

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of floods.
At least seven people were killed and 175 affected by the heavy rains that fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and its neighboring Minas Gerais.
It is reported by TASS with reference to the rescue services.
A extratropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states since mid-week, resulting in a rainfall of up to 450 mm in the region. State of emergency has been declared in 25 municipalities of Bahia, with some of them experiencing the most destructive floods in 35 years.

$135 billion went into Hi-Tech applications
In 2021, user spending on apps worldwide increased by 25%, and the number of downloads by 8%.
Various video services turned out to be the most popular in the world.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most time on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase from January to November 2021.
Downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps grew even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
'Will such a 'return to physical' slow down the growth of application economy?' Not at all', the authors of the report believe.
India became the leader in app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
Following them are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS gadget users, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of downloads for 2021.
Following it are two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, among users the most popular services are VPNs (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are in the top 10).
"Users have spent the most in apps for live streaming and online streaming," the report authors note.
YouTube leads here, and the top 5 user spending services also include the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The top four spots for monthly active users are held by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office rounding out the top five.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in downloads for the year.
Following it are the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same old CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi ordering service DiDi, YouTube client Pure Tuber, retailer app "Dixi" and online store "Samokat".
Worldwide, people have adapted to the pandemic by transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be considered one of the main takeaways.
The greatest successes were achieved by those industries that helped people to be closer both virtually and personally," commented the report results, Head of App Annie's Marketing Research Department Lexi Sidow.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. Casual and hyper-casual games, with minimal or no storyline and video presentation, were the leaders in downloads.
The top 3 most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Previously, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company's analysts named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the popularity of the generation Z financial applications, such as the Robinhood investor app, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
Criminals have begun to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
It is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaure Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is disinformation.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behaviour of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video featuring a copy of the person for blackmailing purposes.
"Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Lead Systems Engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow to dress up too much and go in short skirts, show stockings and tights on the legs.
It's a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.

Five steps are listed that will help to avoid diabetes.
Blood sugar level issues are one of the most common in the world.
However, some don't give it much importance, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The emergence of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Specialists advise to stick to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova told about the "weekend exodus" of workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of feeling worse after workdays is often "weekend migraine", said the renowned endocrinologist, doctor of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MSU, scientific supervisor of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine of Zukhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, this is especially common among hard-working people who experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are enough objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change of conditions.
On weekends our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep longer, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "A small breakdown starts due to lack of coffee."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation".
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays the most decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended to observe what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
In South Africa, they have reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of "omicron" neutralization) corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection - the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the new variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index - may be indicated under an unfamiliar word in the product composition.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Also can be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (blackstrap molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates which belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in pastries, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the various names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that gas imports are becoming less important for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future as well, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is still ongoing.
According to the Minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is currently "not in compliance with EU regulations".

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers breached the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The hackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
At Modie's office they asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Minister's representatives stated that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
India's premiere page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's inhabitants voted against independence in the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted expressed support for New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, and in total more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new surge of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the outcome of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major topic of discussion in the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates expressed their support for the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated on numerous occasions.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valery Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be a choice of France".

In Turkey, the world's first unmanned drone with laser weapons was tested.
In Turkey, successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weapon have been conducted.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model is 3,000 metres.
After passing the necessary tests, the UAV must be put into service for the Turkish military to use it for the destruction of explosive devices without the need for sappers.
The Agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article on the relations between Russia and the USA.
The readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of the relations between Russia and the USA.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite in a front against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," - RIA News quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land."

The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer which provides increased absorption and transmission of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, adheres tightly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When delivering nutrients to the skin, hydrogel minimizes accompanying moisture loss and forces the essence to penetrate deep layers of the skin.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicentre of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were affected.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant they will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11, this was reported by the external adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President, Aleksey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," he is quoted as saying by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are reactive rather than piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory by the end of the following year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the joint forces' military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kyiv Oblast for training personnel, testing and servicing Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a 'big real step forward'.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
Lions escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions settled on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't move away from him because of the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of Mandai Wildlife Group staff, who oversee all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranqulizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Specialists warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Studies have shown that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folate, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the publication Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Bet Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to be careful with the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows down ageing.
Since it is contained, inter alia, in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people may die from the OMICRON strain by April.
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months due to the spread of the Omega-strain of coronavirus if restrictive measures are not tightened over winter.
The newspaper The Guardian reported with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25 thousand deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the Omicroon strain remains at its current level, around 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omikron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, there have been 1898 cases of Omikron-strain coronavirus infection detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the British Department of Health, Sadjid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter worldwide.
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world register of ships was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of climate change mitigation, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money for a floating fortress costing £50 million or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second cause is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas before all these people would go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and hold meetings via Zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least one or two years earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the wealthy and call it decadent.
Rich people, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of deprivation, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes provoke resentment in society, as the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to implement this given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of the keel above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building the 183 metre long yacht REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" as well as a submarine boat dedicated to exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads, outdoor cinemas, and on some of them, such as the wrestler McGregor's yacht, a platform for wrestling have become commonplace. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance if you consider that there are just over 2000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than the footprint of an average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail was attributed to his 162.5 meter long yacht Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to sail the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is written by the publication Daily Express.
The experts concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, the risk of colorectal cancer is higher among moderately drinking men than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't realize how advanced four-legged pets really are.
For many years biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence has evolved.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were released in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poetry, don't understand anything about politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
The scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and in terms of learning ability are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepared for trade between the USA and Russia.
The US and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
He believes that Washington and Moscow are planning to resume talks soon on US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate but just send the offeror away.
"As for Ukraine, trade is in the offing," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are done covertly, quickly and immediately move to offensive operations, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and counter-forces deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the rail transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies that will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
In the last six months China has significantly increased its exports of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first domestically developed two-story high-speed electric trains for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the centre of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yao Shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, carrying out a number of independent research and development, China has created a leading system of railway transport equipment production, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yao-shan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheikin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as inability to concentrate, plan, and reduced level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion about hearing loss being both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and deficiencies of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends supporting a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic," said Golosheikin.
Previously, a UK dementia research charity has stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered to be vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
Former President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His neurological status is leading in his illness.
'The stable problems are those of mobility, coordination, and variability of character,' said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia,”Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to boycott the receipt of medical assistance after personnel of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was able to quickly repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
Protest rallies against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for the people's choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship, and have called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, and over 88 thousand patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on the unified QR-code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a certificate of vaccination or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be set for train and plane trips.

Steep Climb: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, allowing the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taiwu in Zhangjiajie, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, there are also greening works: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including in Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizing Adviser, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the slopes in winter.
Fionna, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70 years old, lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, eateries with dishes of national cuisine are opened.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO has stated.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have stated.
In connection with the International Universal Health Coverage Day marked on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in health services, caused excessive strain on health systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, population coverage by immunization has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty and more than four billion people have virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister Disconnected from 'Democracy Summit' Broadcast at White House Request
The performance of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was streamed without video, as evidenced by the Summit's recording on YouTube.
Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate colour from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation's Council of Ministers Yuri Averianov stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Don't lump them all together - there are bad people, you might have specific grievances against them...
But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, etc.?
Write that they are "scoundrels, didn't return the money".
It is none of your business how many and when they have children, until they hang them around your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's only in education that it's like this...
Elected parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding existing ones.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result for the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossing points must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements shall be in effect from the day when the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities hosting land border crossing points and meeting certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The MFA reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with "Izvestia" assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some kind of improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with both the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat noted.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Foreign Ministry head added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, except for such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is observed.
Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that its signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with an intranasal preparation against COVID outside of hospitals.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centres.
TASS reported this from virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Setting up points for on-site vaccination in airports and shopping centres is easier, but I would only do this initially in medical institutions.
The thing is that there is a small but desirable chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, so it is preferable for the person to stay near the doctor's office afterwards.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic medications that work literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," Netesov stated.
According to the virologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centres will be possible when there is enough experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then so can others.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omikron-strain of coronavirus - RT were recorded in one day.
In the United Kingdom, 1239 new cases of infection with the new Omikron strain of coronavirus were detected in one day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast estimated that in England by April due to an outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "Omicron" strain, up to 75,000 people could die.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself," the Kremlin's official representative said on the Russia 1 television channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It was previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank head German Gref is sure that it is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
On December 12th, this was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted spoke against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south Pacific supported independence from France.
Results of 2.99% of ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to abstain from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020 the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres away from mainland France.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is data indicating a decrease in vaccine efficacy against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of 9 December, "Omikron" was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant."
Preliminary estimates from the UAR suggest that it ("severity of illness" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", - the WHO technical statement reads.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are currently progressing either mildly or asymptomatically.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta" strain.
Two cases of infection with the omicron-strain have been reported in Russia.
They had been previously immunized, reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-MP of the Verkhovna Rada Vadym Denysenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the Head of State may lose Western support, and may also be willing to compromise on Donbass.
On this on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option which Denisenko called "the ideal storm" assumes that Ukraine will be abandoned by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key products that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and resistance from the government with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups - Ed.)”, the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to internal opposition within the country.
At the end of the summer Zelensky's positions will weaken, according to the former MP the probability of such a situation is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the President, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - transforming Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This could be brought about by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario could result from a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to record low levels, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for former president of the country Petro Poroshenko.
Among all those polled, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, very sad to hear that.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, it was a live broadcast for us, the residents of Primorsky Krai, in real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions were roaring, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in other victories, such as cheering for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes then.
I once saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there they were rolling watermelons up a ramp onto a ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on the harvesting and loading of watermelons in Astrakhan oblast and have never encountered watermelons heavier than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette Bra With Soft Lace Cups (Size: 90E, Color: Beige, Fabric: 90% Polyamide, 10% Elastane, Article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom detail of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
This element specifically allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of lace can be estimated by the festoon along the neckline and under the chest.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl up in larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was nasty and poisonous.
Go through people you know nothing about.
But now it's popular to break people down into atoms.
I hope that those who comment with honor and decency will have it all figured out and they are experts in everything.

The poet arrested for the rally at Red Square: "For quoting Yevtushenko they give 10 days, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was apprehended at Red Square with a poster bearing the hashtag #poetvrossiibolshechempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugene Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol under an administrative article for a repeated violation of the order of conducting a public action.
He was first detained on 23 January at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of culture in general in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his poem.
How were you treated by the police officers when you were arrested this time and in the past?
What did the department ask and how did they comment on your stock?
This time the staff were more courteous, the detention was maximally polite, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
They asked the usual questions about motivation.
When they heard it, they basically watched it with understanding, if not approval.
Except for the four-sided monkey-barrel that was blown up, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the campaign under this hashtag people start writing their poems, at least a few of them, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maksim, according to the protocol, talk privately even in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
At public and official events, people speak the language of the surrounding area so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more; incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and yet still relies on a translator.
At official events, stenography is still done by hand, and the stenographer does not need to know multiple languages.

Researchers reported how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help the body systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in fighting age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of chitin, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or stewed, rather than fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as with other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be offset by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Departure Candidates
In 2015, right holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites in the Russian internet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "The Game of Calamari" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.
Sorry, Svetlana M., but I wouldn't care if the little boy was offended or not for his mother.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely adapted the idea of 1776 to itself, but developed it quite effectively.
The slogan "The Outskirts are not Russia" actually appeared in 1848.
Which, overall, doesn't really change the point.

Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, provides the most even and bright lighting of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, remains relevant and allows you to conveniently place accents in the interior.

Three servings of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two were just right.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190.
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient in that it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high hardness and slightly higher than average.
The product is made up of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: a block of independent "micro-packet" springs is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated to each sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-by-point adjustment.
The “Micro Package” is the highest frequency of the whole variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered with latex, then the other is covered with coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been carrying the status of classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coil provides proper back support, then latex provides surface adaptation to the body of the person.
Case: The model is supplied in a stretchy Aloe Vera fabric case.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
Overall height of the product is 27 cm, recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and Security: 3 year warranty period.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has the CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Actual Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of the upcoming five-year missions is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
It has been assumed so far that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to earthly or different.
If it looks very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not originate on Earth.
"If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaworlds will change Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular in autumn this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will be investing in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in pandemic conditions, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalisation of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred into digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy and unhealthy anymore.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but nobody is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are ten weekends ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hard work, time, and resources did it take her to train?

She also realizes that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.

The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices of goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, as O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, Head of Global Research at "Otkrytiye Investitsii", reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, although the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar course, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
The progress is there, but it's slow.
There is also this problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP.
By the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in last September, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
During 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai had an even greater increase of more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales was estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in terms of the average weighted price of the car - for the year at Hyundai it grew almost by 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the price increase was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent on cars of this brand 275.5 billion rubles for 10 months, which is 14% more than the year before.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the sales volume (by 37%) and the average car price (almost by 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing good growth in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is driving the higher financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands have demonstrated fantastic figures, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada shows average market growth (plus 28%) in terms of revenue growth, and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies whose car sales in units in 2021 have fallen are financially sound: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles the year before.
Amid problems with the supply of auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly revise the prices of their products and other car manufacturers.
The Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the context of car shortages, I think many car manufacturers have even been able to partially pass on the costs of previous periods that they could not include in the car price before.
Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital, speaks on the automotive industry.
I believe that in terms of finances, automakers are feeling very good right now, supporting a high margin of sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in car prices, which has been observed throughout 2021, with prices for new cars rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative and monetary terms, mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, as car makers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
An increase in production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden expressed his opinion on the deployment of US military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
President Joe Biden of the United States made such a statement.
"There were never any such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
He also said that Moscow sees a problem in the military use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.
If they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some strange brew and wash another cup at the interview, it's scary to imagine what will be at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an intermediary, where you can talk directly to the manager.

If a scammer, such as a "police officer" or other law enforcement personnel, calls from such a number, it is not effective to hang up immediately, and it is likely not possible to add it to a blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about being part of the power structures he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and coerce.
More useful recommendations for the people are needed.
Here's such nonsense...
I don't quite believe it was so.
They don't know what to come up with, who to blame.
They made it to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except for the very, very few...
Wouldn't it have been easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our leaders cared about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...

And I can even smile at you.

The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Razgibayka" won the European Film Academy Award (also known as the "European Oscar") for Best Editing, according to the Moscow Komsomolets.
The competition jury, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the film creators.
The maximum number of awards this time was won by the Bosnian film Jasmina Žbanić's "Where Are You Going, Aida?"
The main heroine of the film is a UN mission interpreter who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists" directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), it tells the story of the complex relationships between a domineering father and his children striving to break free from his control in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that this film has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, you are, to put it mildly, out of the loop.
Only yesterday the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KAMAZ.
