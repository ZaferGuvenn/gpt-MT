The goods cost under 20 Euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it's no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of getting a credit?
I generally also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help out for a bit, bring the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it's OK for him, then that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me anymore. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and ultimately forces the patients to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another one deliberately drives herself to death)
Facing one's fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown at the clinic which had something to do with fire.
That's roughly the plot and I'm fairly certain that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outside) for the entire length.
We tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

After my voucher is no longer extended courteously due to a complaint that did not arrive to me, I will cancel my order worth approximately.
Remove #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and order elsewhere where customer service is prioritized and I don't have to type my fingers to the bone to achieve nothing!!
What should I do with this number then?
Regarding Omikron: Johnson will drive the refreshment forward.
New Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the United Kingdom.
By New Year's, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously planned, given the rapidly increasing Omikron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
“Let's get boosting now!” said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today I received an invitation to a meeting by email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I’m a foreigner and I don’t want to step on any official’s toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How else can a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Tried first on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for about...
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing something quite detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) frequently come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can’t.
It will never get easier because of it.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" sa Netflix: Ano ang magandang tungkol sa serye ng "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, and an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
But after the game, the tension did not subside - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the bare result disappointed the manner of appearance.
To illustrate, here is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were just not focused enough after the win at Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained".
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10 000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the performance leaders such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also got twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
Already on Wednesday (19.00) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already contacted a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally contacted each other over half a year ago.
Always dressed to the nines: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe was actually supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season have to be cancelled as well, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists then want to make up for the dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe had already been singing a lot and with pleasure as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the programme "Good Day, Dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working I can only see the cover page but not flip through it.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created through expropriation.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the tenancy law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great
Then I will redeem it myself with the new order.
Thanks for the quick resolution!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I already cut myself on my finger.
That’s an absolute outrage.
At least 100 deaths due to tornadoes in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes have swept through the US due to a devastating storm system.
More than 100 deaths could be mourned in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That’s very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is there the possibility to order this showcase in another country?
Until when will you register?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket in the cart and have it shipped to Germany?
I had returned an article via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts you in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He changed to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old spot and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm taking a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings with Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That's where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to ambush the hero and lure him into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Negotiating, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina from Solution 2 is?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to send it back.
Can you then have the receipts sent over, then I can pack up the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Suddenly, the crack was there.
I was just sitting on it.
Here, the lower part, i.e. the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on German Sky has been decreasing more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start crash put the schedule far behind the plan, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!)
Apparently, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing game as to what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
Generally I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishness that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter one brings a lot of unrest to the comment, apparently not taking it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it only has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programme is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
So anyway, the grand F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
The here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole at the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system through airlifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but fan pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here one could name a treasure chest, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then you can start.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if ever water were to run backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything runs smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to be proactive so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here Corona does not stop.
Please do not rate us badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the courier services.
People of course like to complain about these services, even though we are saying at the moment...they have it really tough.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin staff, the six passengers one by one emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She had just flown along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would most like to go back to space again right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, however there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space mission of Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone retains a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative hue.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself all year round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, its light is even more special - only with shortened luminosity is to be expected when the days are shorter.
Please be aware in winter to make sure that no snow is impairing the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the standard Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if needed.
You can get a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the life of your decorative light even further.

You just need the tracking number in my mail?
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have my inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I of course had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and will study until my PhD.
Currently I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you always hear about great job opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other side you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm considering dropping out of college in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them too :)
Extra Stress Before Holidays & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to relax now.
That's why only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems there is also one before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-officially.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed holiday lockdown for?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, this locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, this very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Modelleisenbahner ME Heft 11/1968, used with playwear and missing parts, see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 about the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928 the delivery of six locomotives, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06, took place.
Everyone survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau the overhaulability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the Central German network progressed and the need for locomotives for heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 that were available in larger quantities were preferred.
Only when it became apparent that the processing rate could not be further increased with the E 94, the E 95 came into focus of the processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the stoker who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the points during the journey.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently and led to months of outages with the locomotive.
Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one to follow was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time until the responsible people at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is museum-maintained at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, with the transformers checked and five drive motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical work on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't set up the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with errors.
The center beam does not fit into the designated bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will you be sent off?
No flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, those are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
They are not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hi #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjoining house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police have taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later though.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status so far.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend motivated him, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information circulating on social media that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
"My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in Nordrhein-Westfalen: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had knocked out a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in Nordrhein-Westfalen had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday night, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities had their lights go out due to the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect, according to the company, led to the fire.
The current is flowing again.
The fire that broke out at around 7.15 pm on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 hrs, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21:30.
Since 23.15 o'clock also the last ones affected by the power outage would have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday noon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to official sources, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or who need medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
This is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the bracket on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't interlock it and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Send me the return slip by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give in again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started in the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have already heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, and it seems to be on it too.
When I try to open it, the message "Ups!" appears.
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers later provides a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back and forth swiping with the brush.
This creates areas that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark colors could otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or transfers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to decorative strips and badges on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily covered before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you slide the picture just a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
As you hold the decal in place on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away to the side.
Caution: Always check if the picture is properly placed before completely sliding it off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Caution: Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and search for the place where I stopped reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Okay nevertheless, thank you!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Children's Wish Treatment with PKV / What is an "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and got the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance.
Some time later we tried to get a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet claim them with the private health insurance.
We applied again for cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts again.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed by the health insurance) we submitted the bills to the health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child wish be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
Alright.
We will not order anything from you anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't help it that the dresser arrives completely broken at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clearly stated that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, however we unfortunately cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly a low-budget film is.
The Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you
Best regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus comes with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, declared the researcher of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This limbo - Belarus doesn't quite give in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development would simultaneously weaken the cohesion in the Union.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night of Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokesperson of the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the ruler in Minsk, luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of the border according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian company is apparently not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is being made regarding a supposed breach of regulations by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is alleged to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes’ view, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thanks for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were coupons for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up that day by the red and white jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and sensitively listens to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your error, to be fixed and not all from our household.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
They won't both admit their mistake.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution is simply completely lost.
God has set all this in motion for my sake.
But once you are a creationist you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification levels.
However, these figures only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to actual usage conditions.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When optimal usage conditions are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in Krembz municipality are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for that.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And that with the coupon??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any debates here about which dish is better, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan which received and sent up to 50 Mbit with only a few failures.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module that broadcasts the wifi no longer receives the full 500, but the further away I am from the module in the house, the less it receives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet with the new fiber connection now being slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch bank accounts.
Whoever thought there would be peace with checking accounts now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 Euro: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance even won the case against this regulation at the Berlin Regional Court.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
Nevertheless, Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
That their hearts still fly to the female and male fans equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can’t do it.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame make one happy as well.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport-Königsklasse.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I have calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He initially fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday drove out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive win.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously being in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it too", said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte picked up her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She notched her first podium finish this winter in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden and Leonie Fiebig placed third.
It was super cool for me to get first place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am really happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in my cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired which made me very angry.
Check the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is basically 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also distant and we currently see each other less (1-2x a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having tummy ache right now, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his snuggly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have homework coming up that we obviously have to divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently well managed, I'm somewhat well treated and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I'm managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently asking a lot of me; tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can’t even put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color was exactly as on the website for the first delivery.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Otherwise two times.
It was not confirmed, however.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always seemed strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between personal and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I prefer to write in English, which I understand well.
That's very long, then I would advise against it.
It's good, thanks.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for adolescents.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the movie.
On the one hand the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If that rings a bell I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from its belly?
Or does it face down directly into the mattress?
Det kan du bruke til å trekke slutninger om alt er i orden.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was for example common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hi, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and haven't received any response yet.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I request you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What is it now?
A generic advertising channel trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which applies to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How is one supposed to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it awful.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable exclusively for the following applications as a heat pad:
Before warming the pillow, check for any unusual odors, stains, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Make sure to follow the given warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
It's not running for Ingolstadt even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore despite the power supply being plugged in.
After that, I took out the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is anything else broken?
Thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
The 20 liter capacity swallows even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, remain well organised and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an ingeniously designed solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal clasp hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack located in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
Snap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be securely closed without latching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest downside of traditional top-loading backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
The Everyday Backpack allows you to customize the interior space (more on that below) and store both items separately and easily – and access them independently through the two side openings.
This way you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left backpack half and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of
Contact from the shipping company announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I have not received a message yet.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support staff, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would get an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cupboard could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help.
Wishing you a pleasant evening.
Hi, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a bigger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and was not able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneering colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, your selection is revealed and you place your pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock-in!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, thus covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough Gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a fierce debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I'm very thankful that many people now think and act differently.
To us parents and other responsible adults, it must never, ever, ever be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible and sensible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss abolishing the testing requirement for those who are three times vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly, whether and from when the testing obligation can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I best proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly it results in hearing noises/voices, less often in seeing pictures, and most rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does accurately describe awareness, however u/Nitemarex **had none per definition.
I misread their comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the broken chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce, in addition to legal obligations.
Please check again if they will at least take back the broken chair.
We are selling the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money there.
I already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order since I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not going to be called?
I had formulated a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle passed away at 97 years old.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The Shattering Diary of a Slow Farewell to the World, kept by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify here my life's gratitude".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time

In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got lots of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and buttery soft!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I’ve got the taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I will set a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens next?
What's up with the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn’t as good anymore, but I can manage that.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But the money hasn't come in to me yet today.
Please check there.
Where to find Christmas roast in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Additionally, the VT+ series amplifiers feature a unique POWER LEVEL control, allowing you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that you can even make a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL control if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This incoming signal is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when making direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
Had seen that with others though.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update in the next few weeks for the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or coupon.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1.000 Euro on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had been resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Sachsen - Free State now has highest Corona incidence rate
Thuringia has replaced Sachsen and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only state, Thüringen had a Corona-Inzidenz rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Fridays and Saturdays, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were intensively medically treated in hospitals on Sunday.
There can be delays in reporting at weekends.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense.
8 euro The return fee is a cheek in my eyes.
It is time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one thing can be concluded: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction of how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
Here, the community around the MBundestag is asked, which would like to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Objectives:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What existing regulations need to be amended/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How much time do I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had been a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is, I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was a feeling of discontent on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without one intending it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there in person due to a funeral, unfortunately that can't be changed.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me please.
Starting February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state.
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant certificate for 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the Land Rheinland-Pfalz is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
Above and below water they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent expectation of increasing activity: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel rivers as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations but I synchronized, removed and re-downloaded the app, NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole process has already taken me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's the way it is then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also weapon carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, however, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people on the right are naturally attracted to uniforms and weapons carriers, and it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
Even these fringe groups, though it may sound strange at first, in my experience have a conservative stance, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by overly left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposedly fighting for them or trying to do them right, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Going back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain ideological allies meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is a good thing in my opinion that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I had been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Orderly by child?
Hello, I have been pondering something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and then and then I get motivated and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never like "someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with the child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
For me, I have no motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does one have a greater incentive with a child or does one remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut provides maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wider embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows and knee bends)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface texture that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal at the face on the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zipper at arm and leg joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load bearing when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P Back Zip (Overall without Hood) with Metal Slider and Built-in Water Dam System for Improved Sealing (Beuchat Patent)

Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all the standard wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I have done a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, that means I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a Social Worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in for example addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems for me (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm mentally challenged" etc.).
I will probably have the same problems in any job but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
When I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book appears.
Are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cupboard.
The bird breaks down the protein (protein) taken up with the feed in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this curative dose of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our land.
So application for felling submitted to the municipality.
An employee is writing to me that felling of fruit trees and thus walnut is not part of the statute.
The bylaws explicitly state walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious Traffic Accident near Selb

Ah okay, I see.
Good, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into this now.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But then it was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Eventually I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings" arrived.
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can always switch.
But right now I am absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's vacation time, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had free time there.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally it's fun and from the outside it looks like Ref is running well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life—especially when I read some of your posts here—or if I should go back to the old field where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and I worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can see that everything is kind of chaotic, but maybe you have advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has steadily evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which natural resonances just pour out.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound just the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amp primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make the perfect choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed by cooled lava with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children especially can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were bestowed in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, had thrown gold secretly into the windows of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus creating a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all countries with a Christian influence, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white flowing beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Many thanks.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
A man armed with a weapon was shot by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace there are several embassies located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I'm immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Max. illumination duration: 10 hours
The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp fascinates with white or coloured light (in six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "shining stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matt white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to light up automatically; you can choose the colour yourself: in addition to daylight white, there are six attractive light colours to choose from.
The shutdown also eventually happens automatically once the battery charge drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
During the lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway.....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on reddit after a year.
As for my problem: About five years ago I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pains during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten an explosion of acne from 0 to 100 during my last approximately two-year break and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and hassle-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, love is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
I have also tried all kinds of nutrition in the course of Christian illness and have stayed on a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else has really worked well.
It may also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't really want to look for what else is wrong.
I had already given everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
but is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in large sizes in black

In the courtroom they are sitting in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hi, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the e-mail address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have any way to keep it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Sure, I already ordered the same chair in blue in November and got it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in grey.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is now?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, thus there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thanks for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is the same for all books, hence the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching but I am currently still having big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped with technology, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
At school I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and for me every hour stands for itself.
Basically, the methods also repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When I plan, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am mostly unsatisfied with the tasks in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets, too.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, however I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only allowed to be entered by those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations, from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that there are sales declines in stores with non-daily needs items.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the CEO.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation must be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company specialising in shopping centres, Deutsche Euroshop, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the revenues at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now surely fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the Centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which has been attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities takes care of setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
Moreover, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality arises from the possibility of operation with economical NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locks on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way you can transport or store the lamp safely, with all the accessories you might want to buy.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had last been without a win in two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned it up, shot the frustration of a mixed season start off their chest within a good hour and won brilliantly with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have achieved today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to everyone who was involved,".
At first it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch again for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking with a view of the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "proceed step by step and stay modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level until the end of the year".
Next up is already on Wednesday as part of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 pm, Sky) on the program.
I just got the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would unfortunately mean for me that I won't order again because it already took very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from everyone that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement must be made against the 2019 World Runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not level from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
The hoped-for spark was not this, however.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the closing stages of the first half did the DHB selection get into the game a bit better and at least come within five goals by half-time.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
Subsequently, the German team was unable to muster up an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title prescribes it, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be largely completed, it will then partly continue to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination..").
My responsibilities include informing about the vaccination, determining the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams we often do not have a doctor present, but "only" (by no means a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not allowed to carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused intense contemplation in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many preceding days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "nervous person".
And also no one, "who needs everything to go quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then communicated the solution, which probably caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bayerisches Fernsehen for years, confirmed this.
Noting that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Thus closing an educational gap - even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for road racing - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said, done, and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then what always lurks in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, a loud hissing and my back tire refused to go any further on the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real possibility to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't too bad weather-wise either, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to get this problem again.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike had ridden 120km until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think that I have to change a tire after 80-90kms of driving, then I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting, of course.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I am also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are also those (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend other tires for me in general for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a custom-designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That doesn't mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight high-frequency boost.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary changes during the build.
For example, if one wants to veneer the housing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding point in order to be able to run the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Afterwards, one starts with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of them.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Afterwards follow all plates of the foot, thus the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
The marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal follows.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blowing out), one begins to lay the cable.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
To do this, one pushes the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until the terminal opening and leaves it protruding there for about 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
Below, the crossover is prepared and used.
The design of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Solo 15 Crossover Assembly Manual.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
By the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a sheet of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we are organizing the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks ready, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
