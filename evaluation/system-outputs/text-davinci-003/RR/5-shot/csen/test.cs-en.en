The great return of the Czech misfit is near.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career lately, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Plzeň will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvinov, Plzen, and Chelyabinsk was injured in NHL training in October of this year.
At the midpoint of the game against Vegas, he was substituted out and has not been seen on NHL ice since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Paul French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goalkeeping position eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
He had a 94.5% save percentage in the AHL.
The Plzeň hockey graduate is finally ready to prove that he belongs in the world's best league.
In his last season, he had issues with his hips and didn't catch a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" has played 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille for Christmas, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported this on their website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte has a matching dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not reveal who took the photograph, nor is it clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their rural estate in Norfolk County.
The picture, which served as a Christmas greeting, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him at the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camille put on her mask that matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
efotbal.cz reported that they had access to parts of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of the Vršovice Club, stated that the Red and White had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which former Slavia sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
The former influential official of the Red and White was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The police reportedly had information that Slavia Berbrovi had been promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police had knowledge that Roman Berbr was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the police, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdík.
It is not clear from the report whether the police are still pursuing this information.
He denied any involvement in corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the landscape of Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
"We have never committed any illegal acts, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, or provided any financial remuneration in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, Nezmar is heard making derogatory remarks about some former Slavia players of color, as well as slandering his former boss Tvrdík.
Last October, a police raid on several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, sparked an alleged match-fixing scandal.
The highest-ranking figure in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are Cold War era larping.
The guns will be new, but of a generally inferior type (gunners must leave the armored cab and carry shells by hand without protection).
The cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: Combat- decent but at the end of its lease, Transport- too small with a short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential.
Rockets - We don't have any (but we manufacture and export them abroad).
Air Defense: Medium - Cold War, outdated; Short Range - Good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the town.
I went there to try and stop the beavers from coming out of the river and damaging the crops.
As I was coming, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just sat down quietly and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I hoped it would leave before anything came out, but of course, a fox soon went.
I let her get within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman was so scared he almost wet himself, waving his flashlight around in all directions, so I shouted at him that it was just a fox.
By the time I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That means the meadow can be a nuisance.
On the other hand, it's not war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen on the thermal vision that almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive items in a visible place and you should be good to go.
Vojtěch vs. Hamáček.
The Interior Department acquired respirators at a much lower cost than the Health Ministry.
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, respirators, and other protective gear for professions closest to the coronavirus has issued billions of dollars in the past weeks to acquire them.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for a single respirator differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which agencies acted frugally?
Why were others buying more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I'm not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovakian army that older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't have large stockpiles of equipment for the trained to take up, we don't even have modern equipment for the existing professionals, and modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the capabilities of the reserves will rapidly diminish over time.
Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, leaving no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to wage a mass guerrilla war and it is also an expressed necessity to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, a conflict of such magnitude and intensity that guerrilla warfare would be irrelevant would have to be fought, and we do not have the suitable geography for it.
We don't have any individual skills.
It could be worse.
The worst part is that half of them are playing as if they have it.
Then you have the situation where you look like a fool who two minutes ago couldn't hit an open goal, driving into attack alone against two or even three Swiss players and you're thinking "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "dribbling past defenders" is so dire that I find myself genuinely surprised when I see our attacker manage to get past one of the opponent's players.
The first signs of spring.
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting any major changes in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the strain on hospitals is expected to continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta variant.
It is not yet certain whether it can cause more severe disease, how much protection vaccination or prior infection-acquired immunity provides against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon has been added to the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe illness and hospitalization by a third and allowing for home treatment.
Soon to be joined by Pfizer's Paxlovid, which has reported success rates of up to 85 percent in trials.
The first deliveries of the coronavirus vaccine to the Czech Republic have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As stated, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to be made available to domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape due to the fact that the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic began, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral horse disease on the South American continent.
These studies often overlook the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and less likely to share their opinions openly.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as we were born".
You will do a survey asking people if they like Muslims.
Most people in the Czech Republic will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
Then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They fear cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing their job and facing public shaming.
Then it looks good in the polls, West good, East bad.
But will they really find out what people think?
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% in the polls.
We even know that the objects are three in number and completely identical.
Identical in layout so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atomic Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The irony is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security or for the speed of deployment due to its western location.
In the underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets as is commonly said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive to pick up the warhead and mount it on some kind of delivery system.
Besides the museum's maple tree, the rest are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate who was a Gypsy, and we were with him for four years.
He was generally okay, made good jokes, often over-expressive, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often going to him to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips, did all sorts of silly things, but was always okay, never got into any real trouble.
In the 8th or 9th grade, siblings, gypsies, and others enrolled in the same year but different classes.
Shortly after, they beat up a teacher, police were often called in to deal with it, and they threatened and intimidated other students.
I personally sell stuff on ads (old stuff, stuff I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any tricks on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, and the guy called me a month later to say he had transferred it to his name.
I would say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave in a manner that is appropriate for a civil society (working, functioning, not beating women, just general behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, takes over apartments and houses, leaves only chaos around them, causes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, but at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it's fine with me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, and I will do the same for theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was likely travelling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons veered off into the opposite lane in a bend.
After colliding with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, according to South Bohemian police spokeswoman Stepanka Schwarzova.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered serious injuries in the accident.
He sustained multiple injuries and was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given immediate pre-hospital care and was then airlifted to the hospital in Ceske Budejovice in a stable condition, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car had suffered minor chest injuries and had been taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply and customers often do not provide the necessary information.
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"It can usually be in the tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan where shipping is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, the cost of ordering small shipments has increased slightly, with the addition of VAT and the need to provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email notification that customs is expecting the package.
Then you need to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, it will be calculated by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the shipping.
If the recipient does not arrange for customs clearance themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisel, the process is not complicated.
I'll tick one or two checkboxes, attach two documents, and I'm done.
It usually takes me five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, the problem is also that people are not responding to requests for the data needed to complete the customs process.
We currently have 30,000 packages at the international post office that need to be processed.
If people filled out all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be roughly halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solutions to Inflation
What solutions would you propose to address the current inflation rate?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and expecting further growth.
What do you think the government should do to slow or offset this growth?
Is this the way forward for you, for example, with Poland reducing VAT on food and PHM?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much have you been given as a bonus (if you are an employee)?
I got a 2% raise this year which is a joke, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the side.
Could someone explain to me why proven violent offenders are only sent to prison for 6 months?
I can't wrap my head around how the court can only sentence such an animal to 6 months behind bars only for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma that his/her victim will have for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it.
Will this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had summoned her himself.
He took a roundabout way to do it.
He first approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
When the police were called to the scene, they were surprised to find that the alleged "victim" had made up the story to get them to come.
He actually just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
Upon checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I'm interested to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, too bad Churchill couldn't get the US to liberate Prague :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without evidence just because it might potentially bring benefit.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are estimated to be around ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say it is quite likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
Even in the Ten Commandments it states that there is no other god but Jehovah.
Wouldn't it then be more rational to abstain from belief in any god, rather than risk picking the wrong one out of thousands and having the one true god I didn't pick send me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for each) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If one performs well, they may be offered a professional opportunity.
Something like this would be useful to all branches of the Czech Armed Forces.
It could be done in collaboration with the Defense University.
We can say this: There is a constant dialogue between the educational sector and industry, companies are recruiting from schools and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, transitioning from one field to another, etc.
A similar crossover should be seen between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, the institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongol invader will ever set foot here again.
It's funny how you think NATO is set in stone, we have allies and they will come to our aid if something goes wrong.
Praise the Lord.
One election in the US can cut their budget and the whole NATO goes down the drain.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they will take what they want if we turn our backs on them.
The only thing that has consistently served as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed military and a population that is able to operate the military technology of its time.
Today, any teenager can fly a drone, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications, that's obsolete now, but a tech-savvy teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How to Not Get Lost in a Box-Tsunami
You open your presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home, surrounded by boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that are in need of packaging materials.
A map of stores that will accept your used boxes was created.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a waste to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating stores (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and avoid overflowing blue bins.
Retailers are welcoming the current shortage of packaging and the savings it brings, as cardboard packaging has increased in price by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly and organic cosmetics.
Individuals bring us boxes and packing materials to Popůvky near Brno, but we also have regular deliveries from companies with whom we have arranged for the collection of discarded cardboard.
We will use all of this for packing orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and businesses are creating a more responsible world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can be disposed of properly, and reusable items can find a second home.
The project map now contains over 100,000 such locations.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste are being added," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems wrong to me that technology is so simple and foolproof nowadays that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple Photos or even mobile phones in general just hide the underlying file system with folders and dump everything onto one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but let them learn something too.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the streets - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be accomplished in half a year.
French politicians and voters alike love it that way.
Macron's supporters, split between the right and left, agree on little, but on Europe, yes.
There will be new elections for the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators quickly criticized Macron for his pro-European propaganda and rewriting of history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having some success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not just look at what's happening in France.
Would it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, rather than as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs learn who won which battle.
Without an enlightened teacher, they will never know the wider context of the event.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for Best Director and Best Actress for Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, it held the top spot in the audience rankings.
The best actor at the Berlin Film Festival was Anthony Hopkins for his role in The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being under the weather. I had a few days of diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking much...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Just my personal experience. I'm not saying everyone is like this.)

Another helping of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A tale of returning to one's roots, only to find it is an unattainable dream.
The Bohemian and Comparative Studies scholar is retelling the story of Little Red Riding Hood in the backdrop of a modern-day village.
Her rendition surpasses folk versions in brutality and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the path back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of return from exile than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains will start running according to the new timetable, with some changes in operators.
Starting Sunday, trains will be running on a new schedule on the railway.
The biggest change is the switch of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet has started to replace České dráhy.
Most lines will only have their departure times adjusted, and possibly their routes slightly altered.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, including an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company is deploying dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be dispatched in Northern Moravia and Western Bohemia.
The transport company will also traditionally raise fares next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The carrier has won a tender from the Ministry of Transport and will replace Czech Railways.
RegioJet will be running a total of 16 daily services, 8 in each direction, on the route.
Further changes involve long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will now also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 routes, two return routes to Slovakia, and weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain similar timetables for its long-distance trains despite the planned works.
With few changes, Arriva and other operators will continue to run their trains.
The carrier will be changed in some regional routes as well.
Passengers travelling on the Mladá Boleslav to Česká Lípa to Rumburk line will experience changes, with Trilex trains operated by German company Die Länderbahn replacing Czech Railways.
Passengers will be able to use a single fare for rail travel for the second year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their prices will increase by an inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning to see things from the other side?
Everywhere we hear of how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil and die.
I've never heard a lesson taught from the perspective of the slave-owners or from that time period, nobody is defending it, just condemning it.
No one in school will tell you that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indigenous people, they'll just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, when they had been slaughtering each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the US, in schools both in the North and the South.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that it happens and I think it's a problem, I won't deny that (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to view it from a modern perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it is what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when it comes to the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave-owners are quite popular, but on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Furthermore, the North was not much better than it is idealized today by many people.
A lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to Russia, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that some universities were really bad, with students being quite radicalized and the schools often supporting them.
And when I think of these people getting much older, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is a lack of young people and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and has become more radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, are labeled as feminists, leading to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in the end, I haven't encountered anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I've encountered more bad geography than good, but it's been a two-way street :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because it's completely pointless to me.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
What connects me to people is interests, perspectives, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak pastor is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always says something stupid about the coronavirus and everyone gets embarrassed.
Then there is of course the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it's theologically similar but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even every Sunday at 3:00 pm they hold a mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, Scouts have taken it from Austria.
The Bethlehem Candle, lit in Bethlehem where Jesus Christ is said to have been born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts were not able to travel to Vienna this time, but they received the award from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They were crossing the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we join with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year's handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, this year it will take place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
The relay of the torch across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
The scouts traditionally took the train with the Bethlehem light to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scouts will be responsible for the distribution of light, travelling by selected express and local trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations and spread the flame further across the Czech Republic, even to places where the trains don't go.
This year, scouts must still follow the current coronavirus safety measures.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend that both the courier teams and the organizers of local events wear masks, maintain social distancing, keep their numbers to a minimum, refrain from singing, and generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, a spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the flame of peace, friendship, and harmony.
The Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope and light overcoming darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Guides have been responsible for its spread for more than 30 years.
The event stands on the shoulders of hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.

I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer to the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the walls saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not a company that provides jobs to x people, this is a hindrance to development where this company is barely holding on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Even those born in the internet age can sometimes fall for a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I thought I was immune to online ads, but then I find myself influenced by them - they're so sophisticated that it's hard to resist.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who are currently pushing for an absolute ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classic - I'd ban the internet.
I feel like this faith has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I can claim is critical thinking."
"I won't believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
TV networks have jumped on the Christmas movie trend, with over two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles - US networks, TV stations, and streaming platforms, as well as other English-speaking countries, have embraced the trend of Christmas movies this year, with a record of more than 200 premiering for viewers.
The operator of the IMDb movie database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been gaining popularity in recent years, leading to an increase in viewership and the production of more of these films.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only includes movies with the word "Christmas" in their title, so there are actually many more holiday films.
Movies traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated mainly with fairy tales, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also associated with it.
The real boom in Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when the American cable network Hallmark came out with a special series of films, the BBC noted.
Her Advent project, titled Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began airing Christmas movies on October 22nd and will feature a total of 42 holiday films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms like Netflix contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter so much, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, humorously described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same formula for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end that is resolved and they kiss.
"It's always the same cycle, and as long as all the films look and feel the same, people will watch one after the other," Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car out on the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming to improve on his 20th place finish in qualifying.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Nineteen cars will line up on the grid, with Mick Schumacher starting from the back and Max Verstappen from pole position, as they battle it out for the title against Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is reportedly in good condition and showing no symptoms, according to the Haas team.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
"He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," his representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-concluded season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive.

By law, Covid is listed as a contagious disease.
That is, in the same group as HIV, malaria, jaundice, or typhus.
Section 152 Spreading of Infectious Human Diseases
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the danger of infection or spread of a contagious disease among people shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to three years, a ban on activities or forfeiture of property.
The perpetrator shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years.
c) if he commits an act by which he violates an important duty arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) causing serious harm to health by such an act.
(3) Imprisonment for three to ten years shall be imposed on the perpetrator if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) Imprisonment for five to twelve years shall be imposed on the perpetrator if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will astound you!
It's like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in six months of work and all of his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, as sweaters were never really worn where I'm from," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours over the course of six months on his work.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals from Swarowski.
He then adorned the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell this sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold, five years ago, was "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to assist Poland.
Engineers, scouts, and drone pilots could be deployed before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are helping their Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and to build the planned fence.
Poland officially requested assistance from NATO states in response to several months of Belarusian regime actions, which have been luring citizens from Middle Eastern countries with false promises of easy passage across the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish soil.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in Southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We have now reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's, from the preparatory class.
No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been established," said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the county this week.
"We are still awaiting official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that there were two nurses from one workplace at the Faculty Hospital in Brno, two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, and four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of Omikron has traveled abroad.
None of them had traveled abroad, nor had any of their family members, nor had they had contact with anyone who had been abroad.
None of the listed individuals have any connection to the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player who fell ill upon returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas' lead in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Saturday a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons or homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday ruling by the US Supreme Court, which left in place a Texas abortion ban that goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide up to roughly 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The court, however, was not ruling on the constitutionality of the law as a whole, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was shifted to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in court.
"I am appalled by the Supreme Court's decision yesterday (Friday) to allow Texas to preserve its ban on most abortion services and largely uphold Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the California Governor.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, California will use this power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He has reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the Minister of Justice to develop measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (over $220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, ghost gun parts, or kits for their assembly in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said the Governor of California.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to pursue lawsuits against certain officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccine has a public testing phase, where the vaccine schedule is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies on the effects of four doses are already rolling out from Israel.
According to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, it's just too soon for that right now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is soon to be released to the market, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promising up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland threatened to stop payments into the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of law if it used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes to the Polish justice system under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political diktat carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be part of an EU based on partnership between sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept any concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But navigating it... At our local Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I wasn't looking at the other stuff, I had seen the same yogurt a few times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy aisle I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I'm in a hurry, I won't even go to the supermarket, sale or no sale, the golden store in the square, they may not have such a wide selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.

I was punished with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about grades, it was mostly just me refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after being "caught" again she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
After I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few spanks on the bottom (over clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
It is important to me that the warning part is included, as it gives the child a choice to either disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
All I usually needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl was asked in 1999 by a journalist what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swore and was taught from childhood, or a contract that could be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
We have once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be careful with changes.
Imagine that: some nations actually like their rules.
Just as Czechs love their dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl quipped at the time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs to be amended.
It has been tested over the years with situations its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents suggests that political interventions into their text must be carefully considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, as it is the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we impose restrictions on policies.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at FN Brno a few months old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with more recently.
"We know that children are less affected and less threatened than adults, with 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
There are, however, children who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently being admitted to the ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously monitored by the doctor throughout the year.
"Now we are seeing an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia that requires admission to an intensive care unit," he said, adding that the disease is affecting not only adults but also adolescents and even several-month-old babies.
There are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"We currently have children of several months to adolescent age," said the head physician.
He is pleased, however, that there have been no child deaths from coronavirus at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominic, a psychologist is an integral part of the team at the children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus ward.
It also highlights the fact that, like adults, vaccination in children can reduce the severity of the disease and reduce the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose for children as well," the doctor added.
You can only walk on designated paths in the peace zone.
But the safe zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside of the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing/biking off-trail in the woods is not allowed anywhere unless you have a permit (but of course it's not really enforced outside of national parks).

He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, and the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that its authoritarian regime is better able to handle the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that its authoritarian regime is better able to handle the crisis.
China launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to contain the virus that has now become a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero new cases of infection.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in the worst-hit countries, such as Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this a friendly gesture or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the lawn, washes the car with its trunk, and the kids play with it.
That's just great.
If you want, I can sell you the elephant for $5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it'll be great...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought complains: what did you sell that elephant for???
The lawn is trampled, there's giant poop everywhere, the car is broken, the kids are scared, and the wife wants a divorce.
He who sells says: Speak no ill of the elephant, or you won't sell the elephant...
World affairs are dominated by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become a superpower if it works on its integration.
It currently operates at an economic and political level (in selected areas), but military integration is still lacking.
I personally think Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe by the mid-century, the mood will be different and it will be possible.
That occurred to me too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be word-smithing.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
Taking an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Additionally, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know American complexes are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, I'm just word-smithing :D
Whether it is or not, it is an unreasonable demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a capuchin monkey named Milly.
The harrowing footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowers in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushes it away and laughs.
Holland fed the ape hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now imposed a lifetime ban on keeping animals, according to The Sun newspaper.
The primate rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a macaque so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The quadruple mother pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and ordered to pay €1,200 in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said, "Milly is doing okay, but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would cower and hide from anyone she encountered and any loud sound or sudden movement would cause her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she is settled and content with her mate, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of the abuse will stay with her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone after raiding her flat on suspicion of drug offences.
The footage shows Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 (roughly 50,000 Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
What amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric times when you bravely skip through the entire 20th century?
Are you taking the same classes in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Write the test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go out and ask random people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and most of them won't even blink and tell you they don't give a damn.
What the hell are they learning?
I'm a big fan of general overviews and the fact is that people don't want and don't need them.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It is partially learned for the many people who will need it.
But like, I was totally serious when I said you don't need all this stuff to stand at the machine... ...because you really don't need it.
We are also slowly entering an age where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
(This is probably due to our communist past and the persecution of intellectuals and elites) However, the price of having barbarians manning our machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, the Covid pandemic would probably never have reached these proportions.
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
"Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
There had been tension between Kadrim and Andrea since the start of the experiment.
The main issue was that Kadri was living and working in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they could return to the Czech Republic permanently.
She refused it outright.
As it turned out, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack on you! Kadri snapped back in response to Andreino's accusations of lying, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty didn't sit well with his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I usually don't comment on these kinds of things and we never really talked about them much in my family.
I certainly don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I care so much about, it just drives me crazy!
I'm sorry to have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
It saddens me even more to read such false information that is likely taken out of context.
I wish everyone could know Kadri like I do, our close friends and family, stands in the declaration in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.

You won't believe what it's for.
Chao began his robbery spree in a residential neighborhood parking lot, attempting to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole approximately $14 from one vehicle.
Then he had no better idea than to climb up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
The security camera footage then shows him walking away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he noticed the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and called the police.
She then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the incriminating day.
And in his drunkenness, he decided to rob, needing the money.
The matter is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and effectiveness-tied to pandemic preparedness.
When it is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law limits the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections for the four municipalities.
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov.

Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Statutes at Large.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all of this that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, that's too bad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of the church buildings aesthetically (which was, after all, the goal, to make them look good).
I don't really care what anyone believes in.
On the other hand, I'm bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but keep the state and church separate.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, an incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava, who was attended to by the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Operators at the county dispatch center received a 911 call at 1:00 a.m. Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two emergency medical teams were dispatched to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival, medical personnel found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window approximately twelve meters high and landed head-first on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have been, and the firemen went into action.
Upon arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, secured artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava Trauma Center for further care, according to the spokesman of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I'm more worried about the public and government's inadequate responses than I am about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is mainly doctors and healthcare workers who are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt.
MMA had a great night of exciting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Pena managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had gone undefeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in the lightweight division, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defending his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one was expecting.
This brought the women's bantamweight fight between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the battle as the proverbial "dwarf," as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was looking for another victory.
The start of the duel was in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started off the fight aggressively and even landed a push kick that sent her opponent to the ground.
Pena refused to be forced into any further mistakes and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm, but failed.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters exchanged a flurry of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Pena then tackled Nunes to the ground and began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and abandon the attack.
The American shocked everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier had the upper hand, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to take down his opponent with an arm bar.
He failed to do so initially, but then he applied a lot of pressure, got his opponent on the back foot and bombarded him with a series of strikes.
He won the second round because of it.
In the third round, Oliveira applied a rear naked choke which Poirier resisted for a while before eventually tapping out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In his next fight, Sean O'Malley secured a dominant victory, landing a hard right rear hand on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
He then followed up with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France then managed to take down Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another victory with her young daughter, now seven years later she has lost.
Is it a he or a she?
It doesn't look complicated at first glance.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether it is masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of significant names whose family name is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declined, they take on two endings and in some cases remain in the infinitive form.
For example, words like "svízel" and "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, with the former declining according to the pattern of "stroj" and the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
For another group of nouns, the singular forms in the first case are different, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally, such as "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly with other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have been borrowed from other languages into Czech were originally not inflected, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
An example of this is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remains in the neuter gender, but has masculine endings like "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like at the Greek border?
Tension is high at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians have promised Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What is motivating refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What is the situation on the ground?
For three months we had not seen a blue sky and were suffocating, reports a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating bushfires that have been ravaging Australia for the past four months have killed nearly 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals, and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and citizens coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will the country need to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with Sydney Ikou Detrichovou, a journalist.
False accusations are always rare.
So everyone is always written about everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to address how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
But a lot of people are still keeping it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is a spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families lack money to complete them.
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in the last few weeks and months.
Many people have been put in difficult situations because of this.
She does not have the means to finish the construction of the family homes and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the already partially built family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case, people are moving into unfinished and unapproved homes.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Stepan Krecak.
We will build two to three family homes within a year and fifty percent of that has been achieved.
For us as a construction company, it's hard because we have to stick to certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it for free," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will soon be facing financial difficulties.
If they had estimated the cost of building the house at five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will be waiting," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment saw the biggest increases in prices.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hampered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favorable.
"Building permits issued in October totaled 7,675, nearly 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and will do even better.
Real vision is lacking, says a commentator from Czech Radio - mujRozhlas.
The start of the new year was traditionally marked by political speeches in addition to the usual celebrations.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What have we learned?
I think the master's thesis is great because I get to choose my own topic, build on my bachelor's thesis, and work on it for a year before writing the paper in a week or two.
The state exams are quite relaxed here, unless you are a total fool and have nothing left in your head, the commission won't be unnecessarily suffocating you with theory.
I, for example, studied for a week for my state exam and when I was stuck, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical deduction that I immediately understood and had the right answer.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then just learn the project and they're set.
I think it's great when the end of the course is a test that incorporates the knowledge gained from the project, rather than just a defense.
All good but don't flood emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much of a coward as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to be involved with this.
If they were against Russia, they would be taking a huge risk, so they may have to play along with them, otherwise something bad could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Teddy Bear statue.
Maybe give her something that would make her kiss Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Instagram is throwing obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will drop to an absolute minimum.
Plus, they keep changing what function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I'm getting really fed up with it lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
In the end, I would be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Working Party of the Donbas
United - yes, broken - no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8th, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the March 17th, 1991 referendum, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open acquiescence, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnic Russians found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Even with the loss of non-Russian populations in the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, stunted agriculture, and severed the fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism from the world's largest power.
If we look even deeper, we see impoverishment of the population, economic breakdown, science, military, rise in criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is a result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in political science called "power vacuum".
All that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and occupied by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs $2.09 per kg.
I'll buy it and put it in the fridge to make dinner with it on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the store discounts it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you describe the mechanism by which this change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to $2.50/kg - how would this meat be different from the one I bought on Monday for $4.20 and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
This talk about how if something is cheap, it must be bad, rotten, or low quality is really stupid, to be honest ;-)
Recently I was in Brno at Hlavas and in the subway the girls were handing out some brochures, I always take such things to help the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused but I had a feeling it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was like a good old-fashioned sermon, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like washing my hands and not being a brat.
What a waste of paper, this could have been avoided if the forests weren't cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you care for them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt me because I went out to talk with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
For about a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months passed and things started to go downhill.
I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up, but I lied and said we could talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will drain you of energy, emotions, and overall joy.
Keep your distance.
As insurance companies are frantically buying up cloud tests and rushing to find positives who would otherwise not know of the terrible disease.
All we are achieving is complicating matters for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being given five days of home detention in the random number generator.
Out West, they've stopped clowning around and realized that it's not worth tackling a sickness less famous than the flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing buzerations.
Looks like the old scoundrel is back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, tried it out (I was 20, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first paychecks came in, people quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a certain number of products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots and pans.
What I can say is that it was a valuable experience, one that taught me not to jump at every opportunity and to thoroughly check the information.
I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be bragging about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't experienced many of those things in the corporation I work for.
HR is hands-off, managers manage and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular assessment is done in some form, and it works quite well here (set some goals for the next year, and then look back at what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone evaluating you based on numbers or anything like that.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a bit of an anomaly within our own company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a sort of almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so we don't bother them too much as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, outgoing Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police have sadly confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be releasing any further information about the case.
Kulhánek expressed his sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28th on a bus ride home from work, where she was supposed to stop to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She was also listed in the Czech Republic's missing persons database.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with this a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what he is suspected of, but not revealed.
Four towns elected new councils by the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Mostecku, Nová Ves in Liberecku and Rovná in Pelhřimovsku.
The number of representatives in these towns fell below the legally mandated number or the elected councils dissolved.
99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
Eight women and twenty men were elected to the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
36 women and 63 men were vying for 28 seats in the legislature.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, and the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's election symbolically closes a challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections for local councils and the highly watched elections for the Chamber of Deputies were held there.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which required more equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 3:49 AM.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will review the voting results and, upon approval, they will be published in the Official Gazette.
This is the biggest issue I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we had a potentially dangerous infectious disease on our hands, but it went without much of a hitch.
I still struggle to come to terms with how stupidly a large portion of the population at all levels view it.
I'm most excited for my vaccination tomorrow because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be removed from office and disqualified from holding it again.
The chances of it actually happening are, as others have mentioned here, very slim.
Furthermore, I'm not sure if the shredding of the file could be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic endangers its sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Has Affected Intimacy: Growing Number of People Under 35 Going a Year Without Sex
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
It mainly affects people of religious backgrounds, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex rose from 8 to 21 percent.
Women aged 18 to 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the past year are at a higher rate than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
The presence of media, social networks, and video games may also have contributed, making sex a lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having had sex in the past year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them reporting to have been without sex in the past year in 2021.
Among unmarried people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Despite married couples being more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinions on premarital sex are divided, with about 30% seeing it as wrong and around 70% thinking it is okay.
"It's true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone says of the thirty percent.
For most people who have moral issues with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among unmarried people under 35 who attend religious services more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
The trend among the "less religious" rose from 10 to 20%, said Stone.
Other factors such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking during the pandemic have also contributed to the decrease in sexual activities.
The study also showed that people without jobs or lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which likely reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, replacing this need.
This trend has been especially pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown.
The whole debate about vaccinating against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and the one I'm most interested in is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it would be our fault if we don't order it and they die.
My argument is that we could certainly be held responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he couldn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a die-hard anti-vaccinationist who is here shouting alongside the SPD and the Communist Party about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated seniors probably belong to the second group, so they will really have to take responsibility for it.
Snowless Czech Republic.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the lowest snowfalls in recent years in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators rely on artificial snow, and weather can complicate even the preparation of the Jizerska 50 cross-country ski race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it doesn't involve a theist.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us on a field trip to the boat dock so we could go boating on the river.
On our way there, we went down this quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended upon us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but I got talking to one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed the whole way to the boat dock.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already crumbling, says Orozovic.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear that it will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The Chancellor suggested that the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group" comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as we are recording hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally every night.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured the DPA agency that Germany supports Warsaw in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was now being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to yield and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted to hitting another nun who had asked her for help with the vehicle.
The police then came for Celestina's sister.
They administered a breathalyzer test and, upon finding that she had over two parts per thousand of alcohol in her blood, immediately revoked her driver's license.
They also informed her that she would be held accountable for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his movie.
Czech filmmakers have taken inspiration from American stories about canine companions.
They forgot one essential thing: the laws of the craft of filmmaking.
Following the kitschy F. Brabec film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie, Here We Guard, is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič ml. follows up his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund returns to the scene, along with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a struggling Bavarian guesthouse, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and most importantly, her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shajmovich (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least it entertained the kids and the dog.
This time, the writing duo has come up with an even weaker script, eliciting a mix of awe and embarrassment.
Let's summarize this.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to superstitious delusions in her longing for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at the amount of unbelievable situations and characters needed to convey this message.
A pair of thieving staff, a dog show competition, a Bavarian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal - and of course the pensioners getting drunk on it all.
When the heroine wakes up from a coma and immediately sits up, curled and made up with a cigar at the family table demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
The creators then explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shaimovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct meaningful situations, a sense of character and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clumsy, and the overall impression is muddled.
Despite Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová's best efforts to keep their party afloat, they have little to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and some dog-eared one-liners, let alone the more popular vulgarities the characters indulge in.
Membership in the Dachshund Club is not an argument - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must be knowledge of the craft in order for the storyteller to be believable.
This did not work out in this case.
There is too much eroticism and too little sentiment for a good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapia, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, it's clear you don't understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, and if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to those kids, you might change your mind.
It's just like any other job, in this case a part-time gig.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season when it rains.
"The near-complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain this week was more of an exception.
That's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the perfect Christmas backdrop, said Nazareth resident Wasim Aškar with delight.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and unpredictable.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and become prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been declining.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"We can expect that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
The streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, are seeing an increase in water tankers.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces broke out in Isfahan, Iran.
The cause of the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the Vienna talks had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is based in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about military preparations.
At a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had made "no progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I was a bit taken with the lady and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
I eventually found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning and doubting the lady for a while and then thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains this weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather.
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the week, there is plenty of snow and some ski resorts have opened.
Skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of customers, some ski rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people headed to the ski slopes and running trails in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers were blessed with sunny weather and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are pleased, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Area, praising the interest.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
Ski Aréna Karlov and the resort in Branné in Šumperk were among those opened.
The weekend turnout was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining and it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, without sparing praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the timeframe of having recovered from COVID-19.
With few exceptions, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center to CTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower demand than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in the past, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
A higher influx is expected during the ski season.
David Šinták, the director of the Snowbear company in Královéhradecký, also feels that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost fully booked.
We are at about 50 percent of pre-pandemic levels, said Šinták to the Czech News Agency.
People have become lazy and learned to stay at home, according to him.
On the other hand, the rental service at Novako in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting out skis there a week ago and now people have to pre-order them.
"We're starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlina Novakova, the area manager.
She also noted that there is a comparable interest in ski school as before the pandemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality of life comparable to that of other countries.
That certainly doesn't include socialist healthcare, where it's often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and talented people are leaving the country with no property.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will simply not live there.
Emigration from Hungary began when one day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rate rose by tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is whether there will be elections at all.
If we live badly here, then some traditional V4 crazy person can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose wealth cannot be stuffed into an airplane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the cast and crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), were enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Peta's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to the nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help to locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Publicly calling for cooperation is Harriet Harman MP, who highlighted the case of the Serb on Saturday at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, and her parents are understandably distraught," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have an especially big responsibility to try and find her, as she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare," said Harman.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, let alone with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting tired of our presence.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is an expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing it to the situation in 1938 is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would explain the "concentration" at the borders.
After all, agreements must be kept...
New timetables for Prague's suburban trains will come into effect on Sunday.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others were discontinued.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the system.
From Sunday, express trains from Ceske Budejovice will stop at Zahradni Mesto station in the capital.
The S7 suburban train line runs from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main station.
The newly opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanding into new areas.
Buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladoboleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Královéhradecky regions.
77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new lines will be introduced, and 12 existing lines will have their operations adjusted during the integration.
A new bus line, 405, will be departing from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has been established, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
Services will be strengthened during peak times and on weekends from Prague to Rakovnik, with the new express line 404.
Lines 400 and 410 have been added to the PID system, running to the Liberec Region.
They are departing from Střížkov Metro Station, not from Nádraží Holešovice Station.
The 400 line runs through Mělník, Dubou, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and select services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 line runs through Mělník, Dubou, Doks, Mimoně and Jablonného v Podještědí.
On the other hand, service on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or reduced.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to railway modernization, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague-Beroun, Prague-Lysá nad Labem, and Kolín area lines.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the discontinued railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections to Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
Routes 540 to 543 have been changed in Nymburk and some bus routes have been adjusted on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region.
Healthy Snack/Lunch to Office from Supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for food is to go to Billy's next door or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement after work, I have to eat as healthy and diet as much as possible to have the energy to exercise.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, so I usually just grab a pizza slice for lunch and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy food items would you recommend me to buy from the supermarket without needing to cook?
Not everyone is waiting for a foot of snow like you, unfortunately.
These are not trees you have to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason why they're forbidding us to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Admitting to the Relationship with Nedved: I Wasn't Looking Forward to This
The Czech showbiz pond has been living off nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They've been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced for the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for half a year.
"I would venture to say that no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia has missed the fact that Dara has caught her bear, or should I say, her Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He is said to have been the one to ask her out, not the other way around.
The three days are the focus of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not take joy in it.
Here it is.
What we both dreaded but knew was coming, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them from a can, or us whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone should know a detailed list of your ex-partners and be aware of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, isn't it, Dara?
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was preparing for her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been serving as vice president of Juventus Football Club for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife had been separated for three years, but only officially divorced for three weeks.
We thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are all just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and I stand by him just as he stands by me. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commenters have already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found apartments together, which I think is the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments usually don't get advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it doesn't hurt to take a look at the listings.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding streets (like Vranovska, Francouzska, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Zidenic are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that area is nice, plus it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know which one you're enrolling in).
I've never looked for a rental myself, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can help with any information you might need about Brno :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do in Poland, it's actually okay that the state doesn't adequately fund some schools.
Either they can learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and have the state pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take over a piece of the education system just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and can then teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a claim loses some of its weight when it is written by someone who two days earlier had expressed support for a boycott of a totalitarian state.
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue being put up in a town square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have experienced in cataloging/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either guess or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's pretty readable, so I wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would handle it in a footnote depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess the author or printer just made up their own symbol that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone has already solved it here.
Look at the comment with ΦΙΛH.
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much bigger problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood the text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, so a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing extra-standard relationships.
It's also interesting with the English language, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's going great.
I drive home from work at 10pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has never been there would call it a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is loiter on the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D definitely not something to be scared of going out at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable housing with good access to the city center, I'd go for it.
Many of the apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or his lover Gelemová, like a stick in the mud!
Who are you spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dad's wreath and Lucy definitely has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasova's words that she often visits.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
The sparrow still doesn't know where it will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently got together with Anika, Felix, and both of their grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying gifts gradually and I'll definitely get something for Dad and Lucia, maybe a perfume.
"I'm a gentleman," Felix added, who had come to the music video launch party at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to talk to, says Slováček, who was glad to meet his wife Luďka Soboty Adrianu or singer Kamila Nývltovou.
And he made it very clear.
Are we Iceland so that we can afford to have no soldiers or weapons?
I doubt anyone will come to our defense, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute fool not to occupy this territory.
I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, can someone explain it to me?
I don't know of any other unit that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and firefighters to afford it, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
That our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
Scientists have observed a decrease in water levels in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and even places where water scarcity was not previously an issue have seen a decrease in rainfall.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are further exacerbated by the way we manage the land.
What should I prepare for in case of a drought?
How can we help nature in these difficult times?
Yeah, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, let alone know how to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also pretty much a joke.
Whether you're the "Bear Russia" or the "Llama China" hockey team, losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game is different than when it's tied.
But either way, listening to Czech commentators point out what the referees are paying attention to or not, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's just how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And IMHO if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of Infections in Russia Exceeds 10 Million
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, with another 74.
There have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
Over the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been reported.
This is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by the Omikron virus, Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health and Safety Office, said on Sunday in a television interview.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omikron are now being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
On Sunday, British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated that Boris Johnson likely broke the law when he held a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually" through a computer.
However, there were groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain for Johnson to be removed from his position as Prime Minister.
Despite the strict lockdown imposed in London during December last year, when Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial broadcaster ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the position of Prime Minister.
Amazing how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is expecting elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of European significance.
How fair can we expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They are unlikely to be free, as the last two elections under Orbán have not been.
His party Fidesz controls the media, gerrymanders electoral districts to its advantage, and does other small and large tricks.
The latest one is that everyone can vote in practice where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from safe districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'm just repeating that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It was no longer a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and seats.
This is a big change for Viktor Orban and his party.
Will they try to hold on to power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are willing to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, where he was telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new developments.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I was also very temperamental and would get so angry as a child that I would lie on the ground in a fit and turn blue, to the point that I had to be taken under a cold shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes they would spank me as a form of discipline, sometimes it was just out of frustration.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, like when I was younger I used to fight a lot, now I just punch something to get it out of my system, and when I was younger I would just slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get a spanking), so nothing too extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not sure how much of it is my temper, but certainly my upbringing has had a part to play.
I'm afraid I'm going to start losing patience with my kids and dealing with it the same way.
I think it's wrong to hit children and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not in that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes up something, so it's impossible not to spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
I'm not offended by it, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call them customers, those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I'm curious if you're worried about a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product so that you can pay off the mortgage?
Kočner's Monstrous World.
Where is Slovakia taking the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial of the four suspects charged with the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová is beginning in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It sparked a civil society movement, but also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What kind of a game-changer will this process be for Slovakia?
The press is to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day or two later?
No, they got carried away and the company paid the price.
People were dying from COVID on Czech television just half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on involving local communities in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is coming to an end and the law that was meant to ensure the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended the debate on the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
Its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local authorities are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers over storage, as promised since 2011 when work on this legislation began, as required by both the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in line with its coalition agreement, in collaboration with local authorities.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has available, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of selecting a location for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if local communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given area.
This can be ensured by imposing a duty on the Storage Administration to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposed scope of work almost completely ignores public engagement and makes citizens of the towns virtually bystanders in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of site selection, permitting, and operation of the repository.
Under current legal frameworks, local representatives have limited options to defend the interests of their citizens when it comes to finding a site for a storage facility.
Only in certain licensing proceedings can people submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the agency or minister in whose interest it is to grant the license.
Any legal action taken does not have a stay of execution on the exploration or construction works.
The co-determination of local authorities that Platforma is calling for is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already progressed in permitting storage, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was entered into by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works is almost 4 million crowns according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: "We expect a significant shift from the new government after the ministers of industry, who only pushed the equalization of the position of local authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors."
We offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of inadequate rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Geological Repositories brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repositories.
The platform further advocates that decisions on the selection of sites for potential disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was motivated to lose weight by fear: He shed 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for years, eventually he was scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to The Sun.
He showed off his new look at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The Roseanne sitcom fat guy is a totally different person now!
John joked that his friends and family had to beg him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to break.
"I put it all in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Get moving, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is remarkable.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you are using the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, such as a college essay, I would look for ways to explain or describe the topic more clearly.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Games like Dark Souls have several bosses, so a "boss" is like the ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how can they be called?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It's impossible to translate the word "boss" into one word in any language, including Czech. Catalan is the only language that has a specific word for "boss" as a final enemy.
It's a computer-controlled, story or game-specific, stronger-than-usual antagonist that guards the completion of a level or task.
The world is searching for missing Peter from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Peter Srncov since December 3rd.
The Czech police have also joined the search.
They have been searching for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since December 7th.
It is also helping the British police through Interpol.
Petra Srncova, a Czech woman, was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called Yellow Notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The search for Peter has been posted on the police website.
He described her as being 168 centimeters tall, thin, with brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up posters with Petra's face.
"We are deeply concerned," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what his connection to Petra is.
Agent Tesla is terrorizing Christmas-time Czech Republic.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month as the year drew to a close, attacks significantly intensified.
We saw a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeting the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to draw the user's attention with a title that references payments and financial transactions.
Whereas last month the dangerous attachment was labelled as 'Invoice', this time it was marked as 'Copy of Receipt for 11.2021...exe', said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials and sends them to attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place in late August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, attackers' activity is again on the rise.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounted for nearly one-fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The Formbook contained an attachment with the .exe extension, titled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The term 'receipt' is still used.
Attachments in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was larger than reported by the media.
From the footage of the procession along the waterfront and my experience of the demonstrators, I estimate there were around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the quay and bridge, and the opposite quayside road.
That means there are a lot of people.
Thousands of demonstrators were joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by in the march.
I'm claiming something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Even the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like couldn't have filled or paid for such a large procession.
The Chcípl pes organization's actions have been gaining popularity, reminiscent of the Million Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be cobbled together from this discontent, depending not only on the influx of money but also on whether the Pfizer vaccine becomes a four or more dose regimen.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certain to become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant feat of science that humanity can rightly be proud of.
At last, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister promising change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
Tom has managed to assemble a broad coalition government that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections amid anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties, which had campaigned against corruption and abuse of power, were unable to agree, so two more snap elections followed.

The secretly taken footage has become a global hit.
In Britain, fears are growing over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Peta's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncová worked, in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to the nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help to locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
An anonymous informant reported Zdenka Dvorakova Kocourkova (also a regional Pirate Party councilor) for copyright infringement with her amateur paintings of children's rooms.
The court ruled that the paintings of the Little Mole in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Usti nad Labem, there was a month-long hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal.
It was a matter of life and death.
The City Council referred complaints to the RSD, which owns the road, and since it did not respond, the hole remained.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Ministry of Transport began to "intensely address the situation".
