Good day, sorry I didn't have internet and couldn't reply sooner. Thank you.
Please provide the exact address of where to go for cleaning tomorrow, the key code, and what time tomorrow the guests will be leaving and the new guests will be arriving?
Unfortunately, I must decline your offer as I have already found a job by this time.
Sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes I feel like my thoughts in Czech are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian through a translator.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
Please, is there any earlier time?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, I'm still okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
People in Kharkiv took to the streets again, and the Russians were unable to disperse them.
According to the participants of the event, the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military forces of the Russian Federation arrived with their equipment to disperse them.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the Russian police have arrived," said one of the event participants.
Traditionally, citizens have gathered for protest rallies at Freedom Square - near the ODA and government buildings.
This area, as well as the building, is currently being controlled by armed Russian forces who are using weapons against protesters and abducting people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Donbas regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces are using force and weapons against people who are injured and detained.
Russian occupiers are also abducting residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy bestowed the special title of "City-Hero" upon Kharkiv.
On February 24th, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure targets, conducting mass shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns using artillery, rocket launchers, and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my father here.
He died the day after my birthday.
All in all, dreams are good.
Hana, have a good day.
I did as you said and the phone started charging!
Great news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two and then I'll go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.
The girl in the red jumpsuit is dragging a rocket to the dumpster. No changes on the Kharkiv front.

Oleg also found me a side job - cleaning two apartments that are rented out to tourists on a daily basis.
Apartments in the center of Prague are available.
Would it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday, or another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could make it as you wrote at 5:00 pm today.
That's why I read the Bible, the Quran, and other texts to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the housing that needs to be cleaned up?
Do I mean good dreams come true?

They have tickets for April 20th.
God willing, we will arrive safely.
When you arrive, call me on the phone. The doorbell doesn't work.
It would have been cheaper...we are forced to move because we can't afford European prices.
I need to look around and try to figure out where it hurts.
He wants to press on all my sore spots right now, he knows which ones.

We can leave our purchases in your car and then we'll pick up the kids and get our things.
I already told you twice :)) but I'm double-checking on the trains.
I didn't understand, will Val and I be together at two o'clock?
Did you mean that we clean up on our own and you just supervise?
Can we switch shifts with Valya? Valya in the morning and me in the afternoon?
Mom will live in the dormitory here because the rent is low for the dormitory.
The main thing is that I have somewhere to live.
Sasha was not in school today, I emailed her teacher.
Hiüëãüèª I'm feeling unwell so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for next weekend, sorry.
I can cook as long as I have a recipe, but I prefer to bake.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have a favorite dish, I love trying different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
There are more seats than trains.
Sorry, we are a bit late.
Lucy, can I be your kitchen helper too?
It's great that Julia will have the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night in the evening.
It is very cozy and comfortable there.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there is a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar starts working at 5:30, he can take any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting, we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian forces suffer defeats there, the Russians may abandon the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
We fight, we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city defenders - ed.) are the people who have drawn a large number of enemies upon themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern part of the state, in the Donbas region, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we are weak in all these areas, we may not make it to the meeting.
Because then Russia will be taking all the steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we are now de-occupying.
They can go for it.
Then our bargaining position will be weaker and perhaps even unappealing to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we must concede.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the capture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us".
Straight talk: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms would satisfy them.
But if we speak non-emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
Even where a million victims are involved, all wars must come to an end.
So, we must fight ‚Äì but for life.
You can't fight for peace when there is nothing left, no people.
Good day, do you have any more openings for the adult Czech course at 7:00 pm on Tuesday?
You can meet your family at Kutna Hora if you wish.
These two are my cousins.
Got it.
I'm not sure I'll be able to clean up by 1:00 PM because it's a big apartment and there's a lot to clean.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I can't promise.
I will let you know when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominic, who is responsible for purchasing consumable materials?
Is this a continuous process or do you need to order as you go?
With the change in the ethos of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature and the study of its state
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for an analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.
Do you know how to inform online that I have been employed and no longer need assistance?
I am unable to go in person (((((( thank you this form needs to be printed out to fill in.

Children are the sense of our life. You never tire of it. Good night.
Don't beat around the bush. Do you want to keep talking or should I just leave you alone?
We go to work and save money besides.
On Monday we will have a leadership meeting and we will decide how and when we will hold it.
Good thing I already started to realize that I didn't understand something correctly and ended up in the wrong place.
I think this is the right decision, better less and provide quality help to these people than when many people.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for a temporary residence in the Czech Republic, where my daughter plans to study at the university.
We have now seen each other. The conversation was more like a correspondence, but it turned out not bad.

Oh, how complicated everything is!
In Ukraine, mobile operators work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, regardless of holidays :)
I'm going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00-6:20 and will be home after lunch.
If you have time, let's try to switch plans tomorrow evening.
But today our city was bombed again and I'm afraid for my son.

But if you don't want to talk to me, then I'll take the hint.
Why did you believe that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for a reason.
It is essential for a person to undergo change, especially spiritual.
I will give you the money if the bank approves it.
You have 30,000 debt plus 30,000 to spare.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has released a list of Russian military personnel who took part in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.

Immediately after the dash are formal names, at the risk of slang expressions in brackets are abbreviations used in the timetable.
I don't want to disturb you, so take a rest.
I looked at the weather forecast. It's going to be cold.
I don't need brands.
Good clothing at reasonable prices and in a range of sizes.
We were at the store at the train station.
Are there any professions that offer the possibility of working without language knowledge?
It is important to know if there is such a tradition so that I can prepare.
I thought it would take a week, but the situation is getting more intense, with sirens going off constantly.
There may be poor reception on the road tomorrow.
I am grateful for every experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have taken away experience from each situation for myself so that I do not repeat the same mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written amendments which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be any problems with this.
Many people in Ukraine celebrate this week as well.
It depends on one's faith.
Is a person Greek-Catholic or Catholic?
Initially, it can be tried for free.
Can you write us an algorithm for payment, we will pay ourselves.
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a report card, and the certificate is received at birth and marriage.
Yes! He's driving it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
It says to fill out a "≈æivotopis" in Czech...
I'll try to make it in time. I still have to go to the town hall to sign the documents.
The wife is not mad that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Blessed Virgin Mary for you.
May they envelop you with the warmth and love of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Would you mind if I come right after the war?
The place, date and time will be determined according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, the area in Olomouc doesn't matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances were deeply shocked by the news of the animalistic persecution of civilians to the north of Kyiv.
Photos of people who were beaten and shot shocked the entire civilized world.
People are asking each other how something like this could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
Nothing from me was surprising at all. Exactly what I dreadfully expected is happening...
I evacuated children and their parents from Kyiv the next day of the war.
Then the female colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Ukrainian army and never doubted that in the event of an occupation of the outskirts of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
I have been and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the SBU in Zhytomyr took a copy of the shooting case of the grandfather: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the verdict for the sentence was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was silent and denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, with five children, from the free, poor "one-estate" gentry, never went to the taverns.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was enough to conscript the farmer and the young children into battle.
The relatives didn't even find out the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the carnival case, the bell ringer's surname is Sharie.
Our former Speaker of the House is from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and it doesn't surprise me if his relative was a KGB informant.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that ordered the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing Grandpa's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are some (no sarcasm intended) great informational resources in Russia, such as "Bessmertnyi Barak", which provide a good reminder of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and eliminate almost anyone who seriously investigates the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Apparently, files containing child pornography were found on the computer, so the person was sent to prison, where they quickly died.
The CCP is still killing those who try to uncover the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you suddenly looking at their actions for now?!
It concentrates the most repugnant aspects of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old Mongol tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
Then, what emerged was subjected to a genetic experiment of sorts, with intelligence being cut off during several waves of red terror.
Watch the French-language film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I was also wondering if you knew where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lyubosh, Igor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow (he has the day off and can go since they haven't looked at the car at the station yet).
We are very sorry to have caused you so much distress.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
In Borodyantsi near Kyiv, the bodies of 7 civilians were found during the excavation of two multi-storey residential buildings.
Defenders of Mariupol reported the dispersal of an unknown toxic substance from a Russian drone over the city.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector entities.
Over the past day, in battles in eastern Ukraine, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of motor vehicles, one helicopter, and three drones were destroyed.
Your coffee has already arrived today!)
My first "bicycle" after the sin.
What do girls do when they come back from school?
We arrived at the place where we were housed from the center in Pardubice, the conditions were good.
But there is a large but here people live who drink alcohol and smoke in the room, loud music is the least that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes drunk men and we with children ... it's scary to go to sleep honestly.
Please help with housing, for money please.
But where it will be safe and smoke-free.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's like they're smoking in here.
I beg you, one of them is barely standing, screaming something, something doesn't please him. It's very scary.
I'm just asking for help if you canüôèüèº
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, such pleasant caretakers.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stefanie, Agatha wants to join the game, she's been missing it üòâ
We don't reach that hatch.
We are not ready to pay such money yet, we will wait for help and then plan something.
How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
Will you open the door if I tell you I'm at the main entrance?
I wanted to see if I could squeeze in a quick look at Karen's cake if I had time.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We discussed children with special needs and their educational system in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shahova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how did we find the dog, how did we find the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked me to send you their greetings and to say that they are very interested in reading the news.
People of Romanian nationality have been mentioned as having privileges in Ukraine.
We agreed that if a child comes and their parents don't understand Czech at all, then I can help them in a phone call after work.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
This suits me just fine on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to major festivals.

I really enjoyed the event, thank you for organizing it.
So far, Nestor only has a cold, while Galinka has a temperature of 37.7 in the evening and 38.
General Chapka's line is moving very slowly.
Everyone has a chance.
The most important thing is that love is genuine and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish and pragmatic goals.
I'm stuck if I don't love the person.
So, we took her home and drove her aunt away immediately.
She was very, very grateful, she was even crying.
I told her about you and how you are helping Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there might still be an old quilt and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm also very grateful to you.
I was sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had many questions for God as to why situations in my life kept happening that just made me lose faith in everything.
Are small grocery stores open? I need to buy bread and other groceries.
I just decided to go and you made a fuss.
We are still unfamiliar with the area and don't know where everything is. We were looking for a supermarket for an hour and walked back. Two cars are not suitable, so two large ones are needed.
Even now, I was thinking of you and you wrote to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or does anyone else in the family?
Children can come to Vali's and play in the living room.
Alright, let's take a risk then :)
I'm also glad to have met you.
I spoke to Vladimir about housing and asked if I should wait for them to find something or if I should look for it myself. The ladies who live with us said we should go to the Museum Metro station, where there is a facility that helps find housing.
I'll step over the barrier because I'm small üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
That would be great for Thursday, if possible.
I can't call the doctor yet because I haven't done the food license inspection yet.
But I can't call him because I'm out of money.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and it won't top up from my Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone app I can neither change my tariff to get normal calls and internet nor top up my number.
I'm losing my mind.
Where price is not the issue, but the person... What did you mean by this title?
I'm embarrassed to be sitting idle.
I just wrote what I learned in school today.
Sorry for bothering you, I was just really anxious.
And this is closer to how they will leave the borders of Ukraine to be sure of what they will arrive to.
For now, a question hangs over all life.
Yes. Size 10-11 years. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I'm looking for everything for the home and for the child.
Thanks to the people who accepted me, I live in a cottage. They always ask if I need something, but I'm embarrassed to say I'm trying to find it myself.
I just got home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain, act as if I'm not here.
It is impossible to answer without a resume being sent.
I can't tell Mom that :)
I'm really not feeling myself right now, for not being able to keep my emotions in check before we left the apartment....As the night fell today....
May God grant Yura his wish üôè maybe then I can go to bed right away and get some sleep.
I'll write to you anyway.
Hi. Susan, can you help? I just got my payment for March. Is this for both me and Yuliya or just me? I can't figure out why the amount is like this.
So, you can make copies of your passports when it's convenient for you :)
We have one of the best high schools in the area in our village.
I'm already having fun talking to you, and I even like it üòâ
I went to the shelter and they offered me temporary housing for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why there is less and less of it.
The flowers bloomed. Everything was alright. Everyone rested and looked very nice.
According to European Truth, Welt reports this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 helicopters, including a training set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as artillery pieces in the form of the Boxer armoured personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros are offered.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of over 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles citing the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place on a round-robin basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the craters created will then be filled with industry at a later stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered within 30 months of the contract being signed, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is this in the first half of the day or the second half of the day?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish the account and get it back up. I will get back to you. Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without going through the commission, and then when my doctor prescribes it, I'll go through the commission correctly, did I understand correctly?
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner now?
Hello, sorry to bother you. Do you need any workers?
The floor can be swept or mopped.
I'm from Ukraine and unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I'm willing to take any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I am learning every day, so I am confident that I will learn all that is necessary to work without any problems.
I think I've talked your ear off today, it's probably time for you to get some sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I'll take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are wise and everything will be alright. Get some rest, recharge your batteries, and sleep tight! üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø

How long did you study for this specialty?
If it were warm, that would be great.
I submitted an online application. I'll try to go after work today.
We are doing well. We are managing with wood burning stoves, as we have experience with it in Ukraine, although gas is available, it is too expensive for us.

It all worked out in the end.

They still go to school together, as Galia and Sviatoslav are studying remotely and will receive their Ukrainian school diplomas in the fall. They need to apply to universities.
How do I get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
To me, marriage is the secret of two people who don't discuss each other with their families or friends.
Men and women decide matters in their family, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are on the same page.
Why not give it a try this way?
I have rented a car for 9 people, Mariana and your family will come with us.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to leave?
Yes, I enjoy listening to jazz.

How can I contact them to open the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you so much for helping people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are currently in Slapi, where we have been welcomed by friends for the time being.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years old, son 11 years old.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist and rehabilitologist looking for a job.
In order for our children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just had to get it done today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know even big stores would be closed.
To make stuffed cabbage, boil 0.5 liters of water in a pot and add 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - bring to a boil.

In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Employment Office at the Przemysl Market.
Branch office number 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance, so there is an interpreter on site.
Lily has already been accepted to the school but due to illness we will meet the teacher on Tuesday. I informed her today.
I'm sitting here with headphones on, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I take it that we are together. That we are a pair.
I would say that there will be plenty of work after the war.
That's why I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I am capable of many things.
So I'm not afraid of falling into any of them.
I'm just not sure what will happen with housing.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to get a food license. Can I do that with you?
Please let me know if I need to prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Is the fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Lay out and cover the sofa?
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Used but still functional but no longer needed.
Napi≈°te ƒçeskou adresu, pod√≠vejme se na mapu, kde to od n√°s je.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with the furniture yet. I finally want to see that apartment this week and then I'll understand what furniture I need.
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, hard to adjust.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have the chance to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how much I love you.
There is already a crib and a bathtub here for the baby, and things have been found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me whenever you can, but not least to give back ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to get a haircut called a cap.
Oleg has fallen ill with a cold and cough. It would be better for Yana not to come to us so she doesn't get infected.
I'll only be a bit late - around 8 o'clock. Is that okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings between us.
Because I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
We haven't even talked about these excursions yet!
I understand how important this is for you!
As for me, I'm speechless (for me, it's just an unattainable peak)!
How are you feeling today after the celebrations? üòÖ
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
Sorry to bother you.
I was worried that we had a bad start to the test yesterday with Cole.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yona≈°ek if they can help me with some mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any use to them?
If possible, I would like to brush up on my math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make sure it's error-free.
Thank you for the test assignment.
We are hoping for that too.
She is always happy to receive any kind of gift.
Yab wanted to connect to the internet with her Czech phone number.
Yesterday at bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian girl - Victoria.
This girl is a child, yet here she stands alone... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay on the sidelines.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
Last night I thanked God for this girl, for she is the first person from Ukraine to make my heart feel mutuality.
Branch office in Hall 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I had ordered a spare map.
I'm just a simple person, not worth it.
So that she wouldn't think that nobody had come.
I didn't go. Yes, I figured it out myself. That's what I can do! Most importantly, you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of a "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must defend this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility linked to our history.
"If the evil demons of the past appear today in a new guise," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: Never again!"
The fight must go on.
Today, Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of innocent civilians, starving the inhabitants of the cities it has blockaded, and letting them die of disease.
Russian forces are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, visually reminiscent of the Babi Yar massacre.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and even arms, which until recently would have been unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weaponry needed by Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" means more than just standing up to tyranny.
This means fighting by all means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and barbarity.
There is no easy path without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities occurring in Ukraine.
I Sing You a Song Tonight
We agree, let's make arrangements for the tour and write down when to meet.
All were sick except Lydia, who had a new strain of Covid.
I'll do it tomorrow then.
I'm using this voucher instead of a card.
Apologize for the delay in submitting the documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 guineas from the guide.
Serhiy Sydorenko: Our NATO membership is no longer a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the start of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to decline while the number of supporters began to rise.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO membership and the assistance NATO is providing in the war, there is now much criticism of the Alliance and its member countries for the late delivery of weapons, refusal to close the sky, and unwillingness to "confront" Russia.
Besides, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration to join the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the "Cursed Questions" podcast, together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for free, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history and why security guarantees that are discussed in negotiations with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think about this?
I have been notified that my application is under review.
I submitted it through this mobile app.
We don't have a visa, so we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, where they didn't give visas, but gave a permit.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
Agreed to meet with the Ukrainian boy he met yesterday near the school so he could show him everything.
So I hope everything is alright with him.
Because I don't like it that way, I don't have enough for long.
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm leaving the children alone for 3-4 years and then I'm going home because I can't leave them any longer.
Take with you for 6-7 hours.
So, there was a weak heart.
I had genuine feelings for this person, but he acted inappropriately and I left him.
After some time, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I rejected him.
After a while, he called to say that he had undergone heart surgery.
After simply asking him to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I have been psychologically supporting him for almost half a year.
We have talked a lot during this time.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual aid.
And I thought to myself, maybe I really need to look at him differently.
He proposed to me and two days later he died.
Therefore, God Himself has determined our fate.
What does "ready for marriage" mean to you?
He only speaks Czech.
I'm glad to say that I have found a place to live and I'm very happy about it ‚ò∫ Now I have a place to stay and a place to be with my child.
Did you have to remind me earlier?
After all, I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand that a translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, does she need to provide paperwork?
The guests must have forgotten it, I put it in the closet.
You should probably go to bed now so you can work tomorrow.
Can anyone help with items needed for a woman size XS or S, height 165? Also for her daughters (ages 8, 10, 12). Thank you.
I bought two packs at the store and my mom bought two.
That's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my spirits.
Let's talk about something else, I'm already not sleeping and I'm getting sleepy and I'm dreaming of being bombed...
God is never in a hurry; He has a time and place for everything.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the value of unskilled labor and realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv I won't be able to have here and the money I was making at home I won't be making here now either.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all the bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to keep myself busy with some kind of physical activity.
Documents are processed at the airport from 7am to 7pm, otherwise you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 o'clock.
That's why we took them in.
We carried Viko to the kitchen and put them in the bedroom.
I will finish my work and go to the airport with them.
When he is with you, write and find out what comes next...
I can't seem to find my place.
Please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering high school.
So, but I'm doing it hard.
OK, let me know when it's convenient for you. üòò
I don't know about work yet. Of course, it would be nice if I could arrange for the children to go to kindergarten and school.
We had it all planned out. Wouldn't it be better if we changed it up sometimes?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from the middle. Sorry, shall we agree on another time?
I offer to do the job of cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, and dusting.
Work for approximately 3-4 hours. One-time payment of 800 UAH. Starting from 19.04 Tuesday, at 14.00.
I hope what I just said is that everything is alright with us.
Can I call you?
Can you provide the contact information for your spouse?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I would like to ask for advice.
In our culture, Hanna is considered a variant of the name Anna.
Her uncle passed it down from the house.
Created an English version, added new partners.
Write to him if you need anything.
Please don't forget about me.
Are Monday and Wednesday classes different?
Thank you so much. You do so much for our family! We are all immensely grateful to you.
A pass is required to be in the pool.
But that's just my opinion.
My uncle gave her a skateboard and a longboard at home, so she skated on them at home.
I got up at 9 o'clock too, and I'm only now preparing breakfast.
I'm embarrassed that you're talking to me on your day off. I hope I'm not too much of a bother.
We would like to inform you of the change of residence and also submit documents for the renewal of the card.
We are now providing medical oxygen to all the doctors in our country.
I almost forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mother said that her children's favorite treat is homemade donuts.
He comes to visit you.
Do you have any approximate cleaning schedule for the month ahead, at least to get a rough idea of which days?
I can't remember this schedule at all )
The Russian army is threatening to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they have never done this before".
Konashenkov's direct words: "We see attempts of diversions and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases persist, the Russian armed forces will launch strikes against decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously held back.
Russians launched rocket strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remnants of the Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian PVO system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26th, a Russian rocket struck a multi-story building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians opened fire on a checkpoint near Babyn Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the buildings of the Ministry of Defense near the South Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupier's rocket shattered a house and a trolleybus in Kyiv's Kurenivka district.
On March 18th, a Russian rocket struck a residential area in Vinogradar, resulting in one death and 19 injuries, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles struck the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least four people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who have evacuated the city to return.
The military informed the local authorities that Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and that there were a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance around the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on Russian territory in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1st, a fuel depot near Belgorod, Russia, exploded, allegedly as a result of an aerial attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod reported that a "Ukrainian projectile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are shuddering at the thought of NATO fighters shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them, but to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky is not convincing European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is convincing the European people who elect those politicians.
And these words, this exquisite blend of strength, grace, and sometimes rage, gradually reach their goal.
While Biden is staunchly against closing the skies, 70% of his constituents already support the idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be seen as villains.
The money you collect should be given to those in greater need.
I can come to you and we can figure it out when I get there. I'm here to help anyway.
And the air is clean, which is a plusüòÄ
It says I have a "Two Together without Internet" tariff, but I asked to make it with internet instead.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have a room today or just stairs up and down as usual?
I'm already on my way while you're still taking the train.
But I will never stop loving you, you mean everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it will take a few days.
Did Katya ask for the internet password?
I thought you and Milan didn't get along.
My man will then drive me today because he has a car from the construction company he works for.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope to invite you to Ukraine after the war!
Cut one into four parts.
One of these pieces can be used for 2-3 days, but it should be changed every year.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm so glad that everything is okay with you.
Most likely, the concert will start at 6:20 PM and after that I will be free again.
Now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make some tea and have a few cookies.
I just switched to the school's page and now I'm trying to order Annie's lunch for tomorrow.

I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech fluently and am learning them intensively.
Contact: ------ would like to have an email so that Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS won't work here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't be able to understand each other.
Do you really not want this price?
He helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to offer.
If you don't need a price list, I won't provide it.
Tell me what you want and I will do it.
You didn't want to write to me today for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come here to ask for anything.
More precisely, today I'm only asking for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is your imagination doing okay?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy the dress you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't process this.
He yearns for the old reality.
You call into work to find out if you have to go in today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last forever.
Now... let's agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to comprehend...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent it all at home.
Many of our supervisors have not given us our wages for our work.
Where do I go? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where do I live?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything with you from home... you had to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will have to feed them tomorrow or not.
You drag the kids around the whole of Prague from morning till night every day.
What next? Unknown. How much? Unknown. The children ask for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And we don't have one of those irons.
We have a choice - stay there and expose our children to danger, or try to escape here.
She was very pleased with the hearts and words the children gave her when she arrived at school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I'll write to you in the evening.
Thus, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I don't have the strength for all this anymore.
I thought you had fallen in love with some Ukrainian girl and had no time for chatting üòá
I had already gone through the menu and even placed my order.
Would you be interested in joint activities with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what type and kind?
Please send a page with your visa or entry stamp (red with date).
Without refugee visas, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Ms. Libush, did you pay for the groceries?
I cannot understand.
You are doing so much good for us...
We are in your debt...thank you!
So, I understand that this is very good.
I'll send you a photo of the business card of the lady I'm learning English from now.
So what will you decide tomorrow, will we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so nice to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't you want to meet up after 4:00 PM?
What are your overall impressions from the first week?
Karen brought us the medicine yesterday and we are taking it.
I am able to work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
But it must be noted that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
May I offer you some kindness for your troubles?
Because there is only antibacterial gel there.
I'm not sure, because I'm not very familiar with the city yet..around half past 12
What services/activities do you think are necessary/lacking for elderly people?
I don't know yet because I haven't received a text from the bank and I haven't taken out a bank card yet, and the kids deleted the bank's app, which really confused me.
Please let me know how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we rejoice - our city of Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops have arrived.
The enemy is being purged - Russians are being searched for in basements and apartments.
The entire city has been replaced, the redistribution process will begin.
And Ivan would look to see if something needs to be repaired or something else needs to be done.
Diana, do as you wish. He may be embarrassed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, he says he gets tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake a cake and do our lessons.
These are small businesses that have opened volunteer hubs in their premises and shops.
These are the tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to travel to temporarily occupied territories in convoys to deliver aid and pick up people.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go into the war zone, calming and helping refugees in the carriages, and at peaceful stations helping volunteers load humanitarian aid into the carriages.
These were the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war, patiently serving the exhausted and anxious people.
These are the municipal workers who brave the shelling to collect garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessities.
These are the doctors and nurses who work around the clock to save lives without complaint, and in their free time still volunteer, collecting medical supplies to the frontlines.
In Ukraine, the leaves stop rustling when the little ones are around.
Please specify - what age range of children do you mean?
Is my daughter 8 years old an acceptable age?
I am looking for accommodation for us and my daughter for 3-4 days while we are in the Czech Republic to submit our passports for a visa to Canada.
There are a lot of people in the Warsaw visa center and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for a day, but it's far away and the train journey takes a long time, it will be hard for the children.
So she decided to look for accommodation in Prague or close to it.
No, we're all set.
Yesterday's appliances where to put them
But I can't change the password when I follow the link, because I get this error:
There was something burning in the microwaves.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always available 24 hours a day to communicate with customers and quickly resolve any questions :)
Well, we'll get used to the new realities.
It is very unpleasant for me and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. Most importantly, it should be truthful.
So, the television is saturated with this.
We have already agreed on the refrigerators, some Czech guys will come at 13:00 and help to move them.üëçüëçüëç
I want to come to you. Hold you tight. And kiss you.üòò
At 7:30 I am reading a history of world theater to actors, directors, and theater scholars.
I evaluate projects in the evening and after dinner.
Grishko is still sleeping, he was crying a lot last night, and he's teething.
I'm on the phone with all my contacts from Lviv, many people have died.
Czech Republic started issuing visas again on March 22nd, I believe.
Until then - stamps were placed and then these stamps were compared to visas.
The Ukrainian Foreign Electoral District (FED Ukraine) is an electoral district that combines electoral districts located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling stations in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and in military bases abroad, [Footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are stationed. [1] The role of the District Election Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only national elections are held: presidential and parliamentary elections and nationwide referendums.
Local elections in the EU are not held.
They were at the station near the mother and child's room.

Are you mad at me?
I'm going to take a picture in a swimsuit.
I don't need money anymore, I've borrowed from a friend for the long term. üòä
I wanted to let you know that I have already set up a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device for this, I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an eSIM card which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm very uncomfortable, it's Sunday and I can't work anymore.
You said your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You really need it too.
We don't have enough blankets, down blankets, plates. The children don't have pajamas and nothing to sleep in.
Good morning, we will be leaving at 10am...please write the address again, I think the text message got lost.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I will somehow break this in me.
That would have been great, but I know there were no free spots and they are actually teaching quite well according to the schedule now.
Do you have a meat grinder to make mince? We have one, but it doesn't work.
After Easter Let It Be Well
Did your mom tell you yesterday that you were feeling something?
She can't tell them everything she wants and doesn't understand everything they say, but she came back yesterday with a great mood after that fair.
She went to school today too.
Today I saw Christina's mother, but she didn't even say hello.
Those apples look delicious, what kind are they?
Andrei Yermak, Head of the Presidential Office, announced that Russia is beginning a "fake operation" regarding the weapons being supplied by allies.
Ermak's direct words: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to "beat" the arms supplies by any means."
For example, one of the latest hoaxes is the alleged destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia by Russia.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next? We know the Russian scenarios. Name one of them.
They can spread false stories that Ukrainian soldiers are defecting with weapons from allies, and that they are massively switching to Russian army armaments.
I want to preempt such hoaxes right away.
The weapons in the hands of the Ukrainian soldiers send the enemy to the other world exclusively.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the garden would cost per month and if it would be open in the summer?
Everyone is given strength.
There are plenty of dubious stories, believe me.
I had to go through such events in order to change.

This is your home, you can invite whoever you want.
We will try to find this lady on social media tomorrow before going to the hospital to visit the town hall.
He listened to his mother and didn't come with us.
I know it was not easy for you.
And I will do anything to make you happy.
After you wrote to me today, I am happy.
I hope you meant that seriously. üíû
I see the announcement has already been taken up by many. Now it's hard to get a share of it.
Sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Did you not manage to call your mobile operator today to change your tariff?
Sorry, but I can't rely on anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job on a daily basis.
Sorry, but I already gave my consent to work there.
Thank you for responding and I wish you luck in finding a good helperüòä
Your father may have told you that among us there are witnesses of Jehovah, but I do not profess any religion.
However, baptized in an Orthodox church.
I respect all religions that are based on love.
I have read the Bible, the Quran, and have started reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no intermediaries between man and God.
One might also consider not placing the refrigerator near the door in the boys' room.
Thank you very much, you have been a great help to me.
We are looking for a government subsidy for regular housekeeping here in the village.
Offer 150 crowns/year. Other cooperation with them. Agree on a date with the lady.
I got some ammonia-based paint in my eye. I'm afraid of a chemical burn. Can I see a doctor?

Where is your good barber shop?
Good day, Victor approved this house but doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to receive payment from the state and said that there is no furniture in the bank yet.
I am very grateful for your hospitality in your home.
We have good doctors here too... come on.
We already cooked food at home. But we can't find the keys from the mountain.
Will I need to bring a bedding and an extra blanket for the fifth guest, or are they provided in the apartment?
But how to contact the owners, there are no contacts, I need housing for a long term, we work and can pay, please help if you can.
At the end of each description, you have a contact link with the owner.
This online translator can be used to communicate from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.

Each of them has a free housing offer, a description, contact with the owner and photos.
I can't find a contact only an email, unfortunately nothing works for me, what housing is closer to the Czech Krumlov in us work in the Czech Krumlov and now we live in Prague.
Then I won't be able to help you. There's no chance in Brno. The closest last resort is in Perechin.
Thank you for your help, we found a place to live, but we need a bed and a couch. Do you know where we can buy them cheaply, as our budget is tight? Thank you very much.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed these reports as "provocation".
"Reports of those killed, abducted and seriously injured by Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians deserve condemnation," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the incidents "a violation of international law".
Outcries arose after reports that hundreds of peaceful citizens had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left in the streets of Kyiv's Podil district by Russian troops who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos allegedly depicting the bodies of civilian casualties with their hands bound shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are indications that Russian forces have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Baku requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Ukraine.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Appearing on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Minister Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as "provocation".
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubts in who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
The Russian Ministry of Defense previously also claimed without evidence that the images of Buce were "yet another setup by the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it has called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
Russia's Investigative Committee on April 4th released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian forces in Buha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3rd, accusing Russian forces of committing a "genocide" in the city, and telling Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buky to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims strewn across the streets of Bucha, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent from the Ukrainian Radio Free Service saw bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
The correspondent only saw up to 10 bodies on the street in one place.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bujumbura.
The bodies of a group of nine people - all civilians - were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were shot at close range.
Overall, the Ukrainian government has reported that at least 410 civilian bodies have been found in the area around Kyiv, which was under Russian military control until last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kiev is no more". As occupiers, they forcibly deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible words: looting, plundering, murders, torture.
Another item on this list for which there is currently much less information is the displacement of local populations to enemy territory.
Starting in mid-March, Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and to the territory of Belarus, which de facto President Lukashenko has handed over to a Russian military base.
"Ukrainian Truth" has tracked down deported Ukrainians and their relatives to investigate how the "evacuation" itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The protagonists of this text were forced to evacuate beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their families.
However, according to statements from the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly removed to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol, Russians abducted the staff of another orphanage, took away the children without their parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepinsky.
Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like true pioneers, Denis and Marina had packed their anxious trunks in advance, but they didn't manage to evacuate by the morning of February 24th.
They had no car of their own, and the local buses were no longer taking anyone.
At around noon on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family descended into the basement and stayed there for three long weeks until March 17th, when Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were sheltered in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 o'clock in the evening of the 24th of February, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance hall.
They ask, "Is anyone there?" I say, "Yes." They say, "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, and if there was any weaponry.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even an army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasha White (commanded the UNO-UNSO "Viking" battalion, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UPR), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were lacking.
We say that water was a big problem with it.
They broke into the store, took the goods under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway", and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos online of children thanking Kadirov for food.
So after robbing the store, they brought back sausages and said, "We know this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one wanted to speak up, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said, "You have 7 days to give us our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They constantly distanced themselves from Russians.
They said how good it was that they had come, because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good people: "Putin is a monster, so is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything because our families are there".
Mostly they did not fight, but rather went around looting stores and pillaging.
They brought a kite, tied a Georgiev ribbon to one of its legs, and tied their own white tape to the other leg and called it an "opolchenka".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Buchi, so that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Furthermore, we had segregated enclosures ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other, and on the first days they asked passwords to identify whether someone was their own or not.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the OMSK desant.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - we were constantly getting hit by it from the "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that the USSR is no more, but there is "Azov" and, according to them, there are a thousand "Azovs" in Ukraine.
The narrative of "Kiev has already surrendered" has been circulating since the beginning of March.
A Russian ‚Äì either a military officer or an FSB representative ‚Äì came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - there was something about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" too.
From the start, we sent our lists to the Chechens and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You will be deported to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go either way.
Their response was: "Take care of the mental health of your children!"
How it worked: they would drive us into the basement and start shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" rockets or with mortars.
And then it came back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them refused to go, saying it was for the traitors of the motherland - saying "they will shoot you there and sell your organs".
We drove through Chernobyl and on both sides of the road there were piles of debris, broken machinery, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the machinery away immediately.
Many cannons, buried machinery, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border crossing point "Komar" we underwent an improvised check, many people were without documents at all because they had burned.
We were put up in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we heard shots! A rocket was fired and we saw a trail - it was the Iskander working its way through Kyiv.
Though the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, those are planes flying, deploying at the border."
But we in aviation, we have the education, we understand what this is.
We were then loaded into a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Venger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said: "Here I am, a hunchback, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't stop until they bring down your thieves.
The poor suffer!
We think Lukashenko is so great!
He says what he means and means what he says.
Interviews were offered to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to take them.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and UN representatives (at least that's what they were called) spread disinformation that men in Poland could not travel.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to go anyway, even though we had a problem with the documents - my daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get him on Monday, but war broke out on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and at the station in Minsk they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
I would like to say here that we were greatly helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and provided with accompaniment.
Force was not used in the sanatorium.
Our second migration representative told us that you can stay here for a maximum of one to two weeks, because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
As we drove near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully glowing, and then fades away.
People who took the bus in Minsk reported that Russians were constantly shooting from the firing range there.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us she would break something if they were called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, does not believe at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They don't realize that their firing ranges are being used to shell Ukraine.
In Poland, we were met by friends who drove us to Estonia.
We are now going through the registration process and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are now just as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian flags.
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her relatives and asked them to gather the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you make it to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything we need. And we always welcome guests!
Thank you for the agreement, lovely butterflies.
There is no Wi-Fi in this small apartment, and I'm the one who usually answers all your questions, but now I don't know what to do? And the kids have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
So I will be living with two Ukrainian women and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
The Quran states: "Even a leaf does not fall from a tree without His knowledge."
The children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and she can work from home, and the other Mariana has no speciality, so she is a jack of all trades.
How can we best agree on how to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the good news - Ukrainian troops on March 31 liberated the city from Russian occupiers.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from all of Kyiv region.
Yet the joy that Ukrainians would have felt in that moment was overshadowed by the horror and hatred, as it was revealed at the same time that in the city of Buchi alone, Russians had shot at least 280 innocent civilians.
They were killed in the streets, some with their hands tied and shot in the back, some of them were minors.
The bodies of the village head of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhonko, her husband Igor, and their son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23rd, were found with signs of torture.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in a brotherly grave, Igor's in the sewer.
Near a railway track 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a shroud were discovered.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go, there will be nobody at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
I was supposed to have it delivered yesterday, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it says that the recipient could not be found.
The package was sent to the post office and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I take her away?
When I was little, I used to go to the river several times a day, since it was very close to my house, but now I rarely go, I don't have the time or the desire, I only go with my sister)üôÇ
Please tell me, is this housing you sent out being rented out by someone?
I was asked to accompany a friend of mine to an exhibition and help them get their visas.
I had been out almost all day. I was a bit tired of people.
This is a nice house and we can make it very tidy ourselves.
Is there any space available in the circle?
Russia will declare a default on its external debt - CNN reports, citing Standard & Poor's agency.
Good evening! I'm leaving at 8:00 PM, is that convenient for you?
They have a well-organized remote learning program at their school, from 7am to 12pm, so he can learn from home.
Only half fits, still can't fit one more drying rack.
I can pay 12000 per month, preferably with installments.
I hope there won't be any problems. Thank you.
Can I ask for help with paying for my daughter's school lunches?
Do you want me to write it here or bring it tomorrow written on a piece of paper?
This fits the bill.
You see, we have something in common, we both love to experiment with food üòä
Well, the job and the store at least.
Good day, I was recently offered a position as a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your consideration and apologies.
She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
She'll forget to pick me up, or forget her phone, or not answer her phone and not text me to say she's at school and everything is okay :)
I worry about her because she is not at home, but in another, not yet fully familiar country.
I hope I have found the right math.
You didn't think I was still a child.
And work is naturally interesting too.
But I'm not very physically fit because I don't have such good physical shape.
I could have paid a reasonable price for housing if someone had given me a room.
You talk a lot, maybe you'll get to know someone.
Good day, I am very interested in the job, but we do not speak Czech.
What can we give away?
The charitable organization Archiieparchial Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine Russian women being humiliated and their children forced to watch.
Then they can degrade, debase the body and all of this is seen by children.
Good day, I'm thinking of you - I need to learn Czech, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I often share my thoughts with you. It seems like you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners had arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, according to "European Truth".
"All the equipment, all that they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and then what?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, it's true.
"And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the cost of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have looked different.
Things would have been different if we had close neighbors to lean on, we could have fought together.
But he was sure that there had been no war," he added.
We remind that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream of the war ending and returning home.
Please write to me about anything you need.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender on our kitchen counter came from.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fake news and disinformation aimed at provoking panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public security.
I'm from Ukraine, currently in Plzen.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked as a designer of women's and children's clothing from various materials, I can also sew on special equipment and do embroidery.
I am very eager to work in my field, and I am happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this industry.
Of course it's normal that you want to see each other. I was just joking.
Yes, it can be done that way.
I read today that they have to log into the system themselves.
They need to be told and dealt with.
Great, I'll write it tomorrow and let's agree on an exact time.
Please take a photo of some examples of problems you have solved.
Is she a good advocate?
We went to this address to ask the school for some notebooks we might need, but we may have gone to the wrong place.
And a mother's prayer is the strongest.
I hear a lot - a war on 10 percent of Ukraine's territory.
Why do people flee?
Why don't people live in places where there is no war?
Are you out of your mind?
Have you ever lived in a war-torn country?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When the majority of businesses are NOT operating.
When there is no way to make money.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like this?
You can't even imagine.
God forbid that we should not have.
If you find out, it will be a horror.
That's why we are running away.
Some of us are lost, with our phones... from our other life... so, some haven't adapted in a month.
Could you adapt in a month with no prior experience?
Thus, the state gives us 5000 crowns.
Could you live on this budget?
Many charities provide food.
Have you ever tried taking the subway with children in tow?
When you're looking for food in one place, clothes in another, and don't have time to go to a third.
And tomorrow we have to go again... because the food they gave us only lasts for one day.
You want to take care of yourself... but what about the children?
How to live without knowing a language?
When you can't even ask for help.
There are free courses available... but which one to choose?
Looking for work, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my children can't be there.
Just understand us.
You come to the town hall and tell the receptionist that you are looking for Mrs. Krezkovska if they do not point you in the direction and give you the number of her door.
It will be written on his door, he is the head of the department.
If you can't agree, call Dominic, but I believe it will all go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krezkovska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her for a minute, she said she had an appointment before this, so she might be a bit late, but she knows about you and scheduled you for 9 o'clock precisely so that you could make it to the doctor.
So, of course, it would be great to spend time together.
Please comfort me with kind words, you are like a balm to me....
It is easy to use and not expensive.
I really need the internet for work.
How can I connect to the internet?
Someone may have already been taken, so they don't raise it.
Good evening! Did we forget to write about those Czech language courses!?
We already missed the first oneüòâüôÑ
I'm sorry because I really understand how much I need it.
I never talked about relationships, nor did I expect any.
Zuzana, the doctor gave us these papers. Please help me fill out what is needed, thank you.
Alright, I'll wait, I'm going to sleep, goodnight üòò
You have nature all around you and cheerful neighbors.
I found a place to live but it doesn't have any furniture or dishes. Could you help me find some second-hand furniture? Thank you.
On the first day of illness, a diet can be served in clean, brought-in dishes (food).
On other days, the State Food Service does not have the right to subsidized state meals.
After the food is taken out of the kitchen, the kitchen staff is no longer responsible for its quality and safety.
Hi Martin, please check if the refrigerator is working. Thank you.
We look forward to meeting her!
I really appreciate such support!
Anita also mentioned something about Friday today, suggesting that she and Anna go to your center after Anna's school.
An unexpected meeting at the beginning of the battle with Polish comrades grew into a good friendship.
It's great and pleasant to find your soulmates where you least expect and look for them!)
The bank will submit an application for a loan on Monday.
By the way, about the return.
Yesterday you said you were ready to accept me as your partner. And as your partner, I don't want any money back.
What's mine is yours.
And you know this very well.
Always happy to make new acquaintances.
Because I'm always uncertain of my own strength, and I need words like these!
We were home by 3:00 PM. We were traveling with Cristina and her family to the castle of Wissembourg.
I'm at work all day tomorrow until 12 at Fpoint, then I have English lectures, and in the evening I have to go to the language school office to get the keys to the classroom.
Sorry.
Please, can you make it on Thursday?
Thank you, I'm feeling much better todayüôèüèª
I went to the store with my mom and sister.
We arrived, prepared food, and chatted.
I went outside to take a breath of fresh air, and did a bit of tidying up in the yard, since staying in the house all the time can be ü§™.
If I had known, I would have gone with you.
According to the map, I was only 3 kilometers away from them.
I would walk there with my feet rather than take a trip from Brno. I'm looking for a convenient route.
That will be great. Thank you. If the ultrasound shows something, then we'll take a look.
We look forward to visiting you!
Besides schooling, what other activities would help your child adapt to the Czech environment? (leisure and education)
It would be great if something could be found for me.
Ask the teacher to take a picture of her as a keepsake.
Thank you, then I'll order for the whole week, do I need to write the child's surname when ordering or not?
Do you have any that will do?
Until I was 21, I studied at the Kharkiv Law Academy and then went to work at the prosecutor's office.
My brother is coming to help with the kids so I can go to work.
It was warm during the day, but a cold wind blew in the evening.
You are young and surely have many dreams.
Everything has its pros and cons.
I have always wanted to visit Prague.
Grishko has already gone to bed, but it's not that simple... He's crying very hard.
Today a new girl from Ukraine arrived in the garden.
I didn't even knock on the door and she's already calling.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that is the case, then I can, for example, work several days a week for a few hours.
How many hours and on which days I will have to watch to be able to go to my job and to the cleaning job, since they pay more for cleaning, so I don't want to give up on that job.
As a water supply technician, I can immediately taste the water.
She said they had cheap and delicious cakes there.
But all in all, everything is good.
Excuse me, can I take tests these days?
I might be able to go live tonight if I'm allowed to go home for the night!) You'll see me üòá
There are currently three of us (me and my two children, 3 years old and 17 years old), and my husband may join us later as he is still living in a dormitory.
How long are the courses and what level of language proficiency can be expected after completing them?
Great, so I'm free on Monday.
And that would be great for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book that teaches Czech step by step.
The only thing I would really ask for is if it could be from 1:00-2:00 PM, since I work until 12:30.
Will it be alright if I make it to that place in time?
Nothing after the war. Nothing that you didn't think.
Answer me directly.
Do you want to be with me?
How do you feel about me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can go there every weekend and never get bored.
Could you please tell me how to get to the store?
The people in the Czech Republic are very nice, I came on vacation to visit my children (10 and 15 years old) and grandmother (who lives in Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ).
These women cannot be understood.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and enclosed grounds between Ig≈Çawa and Gavlickuv Brod.
We have two small children.
We will provide a room.
The kitchen, bathroom, and other rooms are shared.
But first, a month of training starting on April 13th.
Is it possible to come today, as there is a television in the photo on the website?
He says he's comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If need be, we'll figure something out.
Thank you very much for your care.
We can meet up often.
My husband can bring it to you at home tomorrow or on Saturday, if that works for you.
He didn't call, it was passed on by word of mouth. I know for sure that God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the spot by the river.
Everything has its time. If you don't have your own family now, it means that when it comes to you, it will be 10 times bigger and closer than it would have been.
I can't download, I have an old phone. I don't speak German.
I believe they are looking for a pastry chef who speaks English.
But in order for this document to print out as I have made it, it must first be downloaded to the computer.
It should look like this.
Give us a vacuum cleaner tomorrow so we can clean up.
Then it depends on the weight and size...
Thank you, we've already learned something similar.
All is well, we took a walk, I'm very tired.
So if no one can come, it won't be a problem?
I have sent the documents to the email address.
What a state we were in during this shared time....
I have my demons and they are many...And I can't keep them at bay.

Sent Mom a second message.
Thank you, I need something, but I can't go anywhere now.. I need to cook and learn words.. and maybe tomorrow at half past nine.. we were registered for courses at 11 o'clock.
Marina, if you need help with the city, my husband and I will be happy to help.
My friend and I baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
A woman from Damelio just called me and said they had sent me information about further actions via email, but I never responded.
She spoke in Czech and I understood her.
But I don't have an email from Dameedlo.
I need small pliers to pull the dent in the plate.

We are looking for a lady to do regular housekeeping here in the village.
Offer of 150 crowns/year.
Other cooperation in accordance with satisfaction.
You will agree on a date with the lady yourself.
Of course, but I'm getting ahead of myself.
Men have many nuances too.
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because I had my own perspective on life. I met him and then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he called to say he had undergone heart surgery.
Asking me just to talk to him and support him made me feel sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and thought he could buy me whatever toy I wanted and give me all the money I needed.
Then he proposed to me.
There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it was spitting out hail.
They kept me in a house, then took me to a basement where there were about 400 people and no air to breathe.
What about the housing you posted photos of?
I haven't gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this hoax.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working properly.
Is there a dress code at work, or can I wear whatever I have?
Alright, he will come there and take them.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit around here, I need to work.
Understood. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the internet.
I'm not interested in 1+1 at all, it's a presidential, propagandistic channel.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived for? Is he okay?
Diana didn't answer me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out some drawings for the kids. That should be fine. When can I come by?
However, you may require a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I hope you are satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a Ukrainian girl who is studying in the Czech Republic in the field of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids and grandma peacefully.
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
It is generally hard to be in a foreign country, and with each passing day, one longs to be home more and more.
Aunt Agatha, if you need this photo, I will take it.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as comfortable as possible.
I will remember you forever.
And, I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much, Anna, for plotting the route in the phone's GPS so we can get there faster.

I told her that the "TV and radio repair" was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to ask too many questions when they called.
We've been hiding war information from our aunt for a whole month.
So far, so good.
However, Plamka (cat - UF) has bald patches on her belly and back legs - this could be from stress, changes in diet, and vitamin deficiencies.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately the stress from me remains.
A plover, unlike a skylark, is not deaf and can hear both sirens and explosions.
Due to Olga's poor hearing and her tendency to spend most of her time in her room, her niece lived with her "incommunicado" for a month in the apartment.
On April 1st, 1993, Oksana Polova held a weapon for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment, like a partisan.
They kept her in the dark about the war and what was going on - she was formally coming over for a few hours as usual.
But when her friend let it slip, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours".
The radio receiver was always by the bed.
Most of the time, the grandmother spends in her room.
Being hard of hearing allowed me to be invisible to her.
Whenever I heard the sound of her footsteps, I would hide in my room.
She hid the receiver and the television from view.
She then called everyone she was in contact with, which was about 6-7 people.
She asked him to talk to her about anything but war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th is my apartment cleaning day :)
Good evening, I hadn't thought of that :)
Hello, if you need our help tomorrow we can come.
Do I have to order lunch or can I bring my own? Do I need to print these documents or will they be printed on site and I just need to sign?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with home visits. Please message me for pricing.
I understand and won't complain, but for now I'll be looking for something else in my situation.
I'm telling you, embassies are only here.
A British soldier who defended Mariupol in the trenches of the Donbas says they are ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier serving in the Ukrainian Navy's Marine Brigade, which is defending Mariupol, has told his friends and family that they should lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Edin Eyslin's Twitter page, a British serviceman in the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, the RAF with reference to Eyslin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to a friend of Eyslin who spoke to him.
Eyslien's tweet verbatim: "We have received word from him: "It has been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We had no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over.
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is taking part in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Brenan Phillips, a fellow soldier, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone conversation, Aislinn had mentioned plans for their unit's capitulation.
According to him, the brigade had run out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend who said that Eyslin's unit had the intention to surrender to the Russian units in order to avoid being unarmed and defenseless in the hands of the so-called "cadres".
Audio recordings of a phone conversation, allegedly between Eyslin and an American friend of hers who was planning to travel to Ukraine, were also circulated on social media.
In conversation, Eislin said they had tried to escape the city in civilian clothing, but had been unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton reported that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" had threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but between 2015 and 2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the USSR and took an oath.
Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, but on social media she is more widely known by her nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Are we together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find it...
You offered to take me with you and I agreed, as long as everything goes well.
Thank you, no need to do more, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful.
If you ever don't want to write to me again, I will wait.
Hi Natalie, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would also like to learn the Czech language.
I wish you would take some time to rest and think about yourself.
Today, make sure to moisturize your face with a cream.
Ah...I'm very grateful to you. I didn't even expect to find such a person. Wishing you health and success!
Is Little Dusan no longer ashamed?
Ondrej and his father arrived to us.
No one else went in, even though there were many carolers on the street.
We are home today.
The children have been learning their lessons and now they are playing.
After lunch I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries.
I have you.
You know that I love you.
I will do anything for you.
How do I prove this love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it all to you.
You may have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy.
Grandma can't, her legs are hurting too much.
How much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
I have a mother, three brothers, and a husband in my family.
One brother was sent to war in Mariupol, another to Zaporizhia, and the man was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day saying everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to take care of some things first.
I will ask the man in the morning if he will be able to make it tomorrow.
When you get home, please let me know, I need to talk to Daniel.
The attackers-Bolsheviks made up for their losses in battle in full.
They shot teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky and his unknown relative, young man Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit filled with earth".
There was a dead silence in the city, according to memory.
Occasionally, one of the villagers would run from house to house.
On the streets, the bodies of those executed by the Bolsheviks were encountered at all times.
And maybe I will really go with you. I need you. I can't be without you.
What personal activities or activities have helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get there because there is a railway reconstruction and the entrance is closed.
When you get to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you have arrived and I will come to you.
The best is yet to come.
Can we give Kate the things that didn't fit us or should we return them to you?
So, I stopped tossing and turning at night.
I usually wake up early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I usually sleep for 4-5 hours, but I'm already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when she arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understand correctly, we will be sent a letter from school to order the menu.
We will try to make it to social services on Tuesday.
Once the filling is cooled and the dough is ready, shape the pies and fry them in oil over a low heat.
Alright, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle in tomorrow evening, I'll call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I'm not afraid of hard work, as I grew up in a village, so I can and enjoy physical labor.
When can I have my things brought to me?
You have a very interesting tradition, we do that at Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed Bill 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere".
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the conditional Kyiv may somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of the many new risks for public companies, but so far no company has had the need to physically hold board meetings at their place of business.
The potential threat of such a law is clear ‚Äì it is a great basis for "erasing" all the gains of the hard reform of state-owned enterprises after the Dignity Revolution, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
As it was before 2015.
What are the purposes of government oversight boards and who is supposed to be on them?
Furthermore, if one harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, tomorrow other bills may be passed - for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU could be undermined.
Much can be blamed on war.
This initiative actually predates the war and the bill 7176.
On February 22nd, this provision was incorporated into the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
The desire to break up the watchdogs in one way or another has been circulating among some elected representatives for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism itself, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's examine the arguments used to explain the need for its adoption.
Then we will offer our proposals on how to manage businesses during wartime.
Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such a new regulation due to the risks of losing internet and other communication tools, which would prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the board of directors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could paralyze the company's operations.
Agreed that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the members of the monitoring boards travelling to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where independent board members (who make up the majority of the board) prioritize their own safety over the interests of the company and refuse to travel to Ukraine.
In such a case, they can be dismissed according to the bill.
This will likely lead to a loss of quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection process, which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed solution of Bill 7176 is more likely to not protect against the loss of oversight authority to make decisions, but rather to lead to it!
Deputy Dmitry Natalyuk, the author of the bill, provides other arguments in its favor.
He specifically states that "many companies, including the defense-industrial complex (DIC), now require relocation" and that "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vinnitsa via Zoom".
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is a kind of "Ukroboronprom" which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the Ministry of Defense.
However, even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-paid basis.
All the power in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the General Director, who will also make decisions about the need to relocate any of the OPK enterprises that are part of the corporation.
Furthermore, such an argument is also not tenable because Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Dmitry also presents arguments on his Facebook page that can be categorized as "emotional".
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "Respected foreign experts, at the first mention of the word 'war', leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the supervisory boards of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself will really suffer from the war".
First of all, it is manipulation ‚Äì most of these board members have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
So to say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is widely used in global practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also important to remember that membership on a board of directors is not a full-time job.
Generally, such people have other occupations and electronic communication tools help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as grievances exclusively towards foreigners.
It is interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express the same complaints about the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Since they are not located in the same place as their companies.
This is far from the first populist attempt by lawmakers to remove foreigners from oversight boards, and war is just a convenient excuse.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary accommodation with a family. I have two children with me.

So, I understand what needs to be done.
I would also be grateful if you could guide me in the beginning so that I do everything as you needüòä
We usually require a passport from one of the adults.
In the Brovarskyi, Vyshgorodskyi and Buchanskyi districts of Kyiv Oblast, which were liberated from the occupiers, an intensified curfew will be introduced for two days.
Pavluk's direct words: "Curfew has been strengthened in the settlements of the Brovarskyi, Vyshgorodskyi and Buchanskyi districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian forces!"
Restrictions will be in place in these towns and villages from 9pm on 2 April until 6am on 5 April.
Details: According to the head of the regional government, it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport or on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during an alarm signal to take shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to mitigate the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to cleanse and exchange territories.
Omelianyk urged people who have left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will be in effect daily from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM.
I haven't received anything from the school yet, only a payment receipt.
Are you missing any important information? If so, what type and kind?

The Serbian defense budget has been growing in a geometric progression for several years.
Over the last six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of its army, the renewal of military equipment, and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the possibility of escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Lukashenko's security forces arrested three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 in connection with the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Sources: "Radio Svaboda", Viasna Human Rights Center, Head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, as quoted by the state news agency BelTA.
The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the support of special forces of the "SOBR", one of them was injured.
According to Viasna, the men actively resisted arrest and attempted to flee.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The Head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be severely suppressed by law enforcement officers using weapons".
On April 6th it was announced that on March 30th the police had arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the BChD, and an administrator of the BChD's themed resources on VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasjuk.
It is unknown where he is now and in what condition, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were arrested in Belarus for dissent.
Reminder: BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure objects in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "guerrilla fighters" are thus attempting to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, Russia is transferring troops and equipment to Ukraine via Belarus in order to fight.
This is for boosting self-esteem.

The United States is prohibiting investments in Russia and imposing sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and also banning all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in the White House website announcement.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a full ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the resolution adopted by over 600 multinational companies to exit Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retail stores, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House statement said.
The third step of the new US sanctions was to impose restrictions on major Russian state-owned enterprises in critical sectors.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the following day on Thursday.
The final part of the package is a full asset freeze on the adult children of Putin, his wife and daughter, and members of the Russian Security Council, including President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get as far as this place, the road is closed beyond that and I will come to you.
Can we already wash dishes in the dishwasher?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mother was a seamstress of industrial products, and my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived happily and never thought we would have to flee, for there was no strength left to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will take us in for the time being) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's within our means.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have any bad habits.
We are grateful for such help during this difficult time for us.
After lunch I had one English lecture and then I went to work in the nursery.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood it all and will do it well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and we talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
This is free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira is not picking up the phone, not responding, not sure if she made it to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: halting investments and cutting off supplies.
But we didn't understand each other.
The military did not take up residence in our house.
Our house is located near a military base and an oil depot.
He was just helping me because I couldn't do it myself.
I cook deliciously, don't ask for too much, and give good advice.
I give myself advice.
It's a bit hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet tomorrow and I'll tell you everything.
All in all, everything is good.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I haven't written to the landlord yet.
I would like to ask you that if you hear any information about the housing, please let me know.
I would happily share a home with a respectable young woman.
If you know someone, let me know.
I won't let you down.
Thank you in advance.
Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost for another person, Natalia, who is 54 years old.
I think it would be best for you to make copies of our passports, as they contain all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's been the same since I was born :)
Good day Mr. Reyarade! Sorry I didn't see you. I'll do it right away and send it to you immediately.
We are going to the medical commission now.
So Anne needs to make up this hour on another day.
On which day should she come earlier? (Is there a day with more work?)
I'll check tomorrow why the Internet is not working properly.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you...we found some things but nothing from the tech.
Both beginners know nothing except the alphabet.
Nothing is happening.
Is it possible on Monday 25th April?
Children can be brought along, there are plenty of toys here :)
She guessed about the godfather.
I'm either very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll figure it out.
But please, no credit for payment.
Speak to me directly and I will help.
We are your partner, or we are not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do I need to bring the equipment they gave me?
Today is not my day. The blinds broke in the living room. One this morning. Now another in the evening.
I haven't seen anything from you yet.
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you about the invoice later.
Is it only your father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does your colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry for taking you away from your duties.
Good evening, I can't help but share this with you. There's news from Mariupol that the son is alive and well.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically researches the impact of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections.
1+1 TV journalist Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12 that was sent to her by the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to fight with and a mountain of wounded.
They said "the clock is ticking".
On April 11th, a separate brigade of marine infantry, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11th could be the last stand for the defenders of Mariupol, and that Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social media that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, assured that the command of the defense forces in Mariupol is in place and the details of the defense operation should not be a matter of public discussion.
Russians threatened to blockade Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of Azov, Andriy Biletskyi, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the Azovstal plant, which is held by the Azov battalion.
Thank you, I will try to accommodate you. That would be great.
The situation remains the same for now, while we stay here.
Two hours of riding, shopping with mom, and back!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what to do here.
A squadron of Czech drones has begun flying over Ukraine today.
Nearly 50 professional dronesüöÅ will be deployed to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy saboteurüí•.
Two Ukrainian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council, Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today their inter-village friends, led by the village council chairman and coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones on assignment: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the efficiency and safety of drones, the locations of their deployment will remain a secret for now.
Four friends helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic have no plans to stop and say that in the coming days they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
No worries, all is well. I like sweet things but I can do without them.
I'm worried that we won't make it in time. Lots of luggage.
I'm soon returning to Ukraine to work.
Alright. If everything is okay, I agree.
I'll try to do it myself, but if I have any problems I'll write to you if that's okay?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the presence of the village elder in Yivov, she saw that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing available.
She may be delighted and her mood will lift.
My phone was repaired today.
I think I'm going to freeze out there today too.
I took medicine and tea, I feel worse but not critically.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm feeling better.
When you have time, send me some music that you like.
I'm impressed by your musical accomplishments üòä
Mom and Dad should be listened to.
You will find it near your little brother's stroller.
It was cooler and rainy today. It's supposed to be warm tomorrow.
But it's not the damaged buildings that are a tragedy, it's the people who are suffering under the occupiers.
In Kharkiv, the occupiers desecrated the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknowns tore down the European Union flag, ripped off panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was lowered.
Good morning, thank you children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
There is someone to talk to in Czech, if needed.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be twelve people here and then they will go to work.
Hello is already a little better.
He was already at the fair today.
Even today it is already asleep there.
So we have already made great strides.
I'll definitely bring pierogis for everyone else too!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am already scheduling my apartment cleaning days and times for April, I can roughly say that I have a rough cleaning schedule for April.
I can roughly say by the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just wondering if you have anything to say about it..
Hi, sorry I haven't been in touch, I was preparing dinner and had a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come over today?
or we can meet after you arrive)
He is humble and has been studying a lot lately. He realized that this is very important for his life.
Hi) everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today I had a lesson with Ms. Y, who is the director of the High Country Economic Department.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the circumstances.
On Monday I need to bring proof of employment and cash payment for the services.
I'm running away from Friday.
I'm doing nothing but eating a lot and sleeping a lot üòÇ (and drinking lots of water ‚òùüèª)
If I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, I would like to go with you if possible.
I have to deliver one more analysis.
So we won't have to go again.
The drain pipe is not working well, it's not draining properly. A plumber is needed. It needs to be fixed.
That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have enrolled in.
Do children need to be accompanied and do they need to bring anything?
Now, I have one question for you.
If further assistance is needed, please write.
Am I right in assuming that you are celebrating Easter today?
We didn't really want you to collect money from the start so people wouldn't think we were profiting from this!
However, for online completion I was missing two points:
I'm going to rest. Recharge my strength and energy. Thank you for the present today. Good night.
What a great idea! I'm going to watch the video now. It will be great because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Rely only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine is also helping the army.
Gathered several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they will have an internet break.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will I be compensated for the day I was absent from work?
Intelligence Summary: Russia is Preparing a Provocation in Transnistria to Blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state".
Details: The enemy continues to build up an offensive force for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
The occupiers will likely attempt to regain the initiative in the coming days.
Furthermore, the enemy continues to prepare and deploy personnel, weapons, and equipment for combat operations on Ukrainian territory.
Preparation of armaments and military equipment is carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the mentioned armaments will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, for the replenishment of personnel losses of the subunits of the battalion tactical group of the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
A particular challenge is encountered when staffing the positions of drivers and driver-mechanics.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the adversary will continue to target transportation infrastructure objects on Ukrainian territory in order to destroy or disable them, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the combat zone.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially blockade the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of individual districts of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the Izium area is underway to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The adversary is using the UAV "Orlan-10" for this.
With two battalions of tactical groups, the enemy attempted an attack in the direction of the settlements of Dovghenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to their previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted a raid in the Golden area, but was unsuccessful.
In Mariupol, the occupiers continue to launch artillery and air strikes in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the sea port.
Enemy forces conducted artillery shelling of Ukrainian troops' positions in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubovka, and Maryanske with separate units.
Over the past day, defenders of Ukraine have repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight pieces of armored vehicles, six units of motor vehicles, and eight artillery systems of the enemy in the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We'll try to make it on time, but I doubt it.
And you want to sleep, but I'll keep you up.
Are you definitely not against me coming?
If you don't feel like seeing each other today, just tell me, I'll understand.
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up :)
I'm only turning on the TV to listen to Czech language.
My monthly plan expires today :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads.
I understand that I can prepare material in this field.
I will ask her. I feel a bit embarrassed to ask, since she already gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the post on Facebook, so Google must have written something about it. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we have taken the items you brought, but there are some small items that we can bring to you in 10 minutes.
I was thinking about work.
If the Director agrees, I can start working from next week as I plan to go to the employment office tomorrow before lunch to submit the documents (if I can, as the queues are very long) and it's raining on Saturday :)
I'm looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I'm studying Czech language to perfect my knowledge, I dream of working at Tesla.
Friends old and new, friends I have never met in person, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you as well.
Over the past month, I have been in contact with many of you.
Your already difficult life has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
Many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
For what they are doing in your name to Ukraine.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
"Let's talk about it later," Sasha replied, as usual, concisely. "Right now, let's go through the ruins after the search."
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of villains and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduza, Navalny's organization, and a handful of other places - how many of you did anything to oppose this regime?
Apart from attending rallies when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "Late to Hide, Late to Be Silent"
Are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they are a result of your long-term apathy to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive involvement, which now surely weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always this way.
In the 1990s there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even crooked, but real.
1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are ultimately overcome with such a strong fear of chaos that you seek refuge behind a monarch, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he has killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Nazis did with the Gestapo, you devoted your energies to the Dzerzhinsky monument‚Äîand allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, regenerate, re-form, and take control of the country.
When faced with the choice between the plundering of the country or the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and resignedly accepted the plundering.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main priority.
Then came Putin. Young, ambitious, and aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you all either voted for it or gave it the advantage of not voting at all.
When he began to equate Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and have a great time with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I had witnessed: the tortures of innocent civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Enough already with your Chechnya stories." I remember those words very well.
In response, I said: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, not mine.
I'm just a poor foreigner here.
Your government is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the mid-2000s economic boom, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-off, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest among you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices are rising, so what's the problem?
Moscow sparkled and glittered with splendor.
When several opposition figures ‚Äì Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not progress further.
When Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev after two terms and took the position of Prime Minister himself, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or remained silent about it.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the slopes of the Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly did anything on the West, if we did anything at all.
A few sanctions and a bit of outrage, but what does it matter that Russia is loudly violating international law when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the tough 1990s, this was the most important.
Yet, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you finally woke up.
When Putin once again swapped places with Medvedev and planted himself back in the presidential chair, many of you decided that this was too much and took to the streets in mass protest.
Navalny's name became a rallying cry, people had been taking to the streets for half a year, and the regime finally realized with horror that it was losing its footing.
He then struck back in response.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons filled up with people.
Thousands were left behind bars.
Someone got huge deadlines.
"What could we have done?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the Russian president who had dashed their European hopes, they had once seized the Maidan - and never left it.
They had built a makeshift village and prepared for a decisive defense all on their own.
When the police came and tried to break it down, they defended themselves with batons, pipes, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the offensive.
Many died, but they prevailed.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to remove them if they do their job badly.
Putin was not very pleased with the Maidan.
That was a bad example.
Thus, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little benefit from it.
How many of you were taken captive!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth emerged and many of you who had been deriding Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason why we stopped talking right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly stayed silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, all newly renovated after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their bingemans, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You have twice drawn attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then because I knew absolutely nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how the state snipers of Homs were cold-bloodedly shooting at the teenagers of my children on the streets.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there in 2015, who started bombing thousands of innocent civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - for I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent‚Äîfor I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to speak up in my defense.
How many of you have spoken about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Someone of you did this.
But the majority remained silent.
People are really speaking up now ‚Äì like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zighar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people can speak out from abroad, while some, like Marina Ovsiannikova, risk ending up in a new GULAG or joining Navalny's company from within the country.
As for the others, you know best in which country you live.
So I'm sure you understand: when Putin is done with the Ukrainians - or, what seems very likely, if he fails - he will come for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and have so far been met with a minor sentence, but soon will receive a more serious one.
To the thousands of you who signed petitions, expressed dissent on social media (even if it was just a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given for a joke are not so far in the past - and now they are likely to await you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more so than in 2014 ‚Äì is a challenge to the Putin regime: they demonstrate that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming his advantage may be on paper.
All in all, few people in Russia are aware of this, let alone that a war is still going on.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be prepared.
You know where this is going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a sham, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free press is gone, your economy is crumbling faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket on a plane out of the country, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to negotiate or you will be broken apart.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet, there is still one more.
What will ultimately bring down this regime?
And perhaps, in the circumstances, less will be expected of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic crisis engulfing Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices drop and wages are not paid, those people who have voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city takes to the streets on its own, as has been happening periodically, it will be easy for them to be quashed one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet - which regimes can restrict, but which still works and can be fine-tuned almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was crushed, but others can be created, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle up to 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly up to a hundred thousand.
If it reaches over 300 thousand, she will be amazed.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all he put them through in Ukraine, all he made them endure?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those with children will worry for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I would be scared too if I were you.
With examples like Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to defy their master, who dare not only to demand freedom but actually try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, countless lives will still be lost needlessly.
Your son makes a joke in a computer game chatroom - and he will be arrested; your daughter expresses her frustration online - and she will be arrested; your close friend makes a mistake - and he will die in a Syrian prison cell under police batons.
This has been going on for many years and will only intensify, gaining ever greater and greater scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how this will end.
Act with a cool head, think strategically, and make it happen.
We were in class on Friday and were told we could come back on Monday.
We'll be home by evening.
Do you take me as a press secretary?
How often do you go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain it to her.
We liked it so much and wanted something closer, so this is the best option.
I was in a room with a lot of people and felt drained of energy.
I feel bad, coughing, fever, lost voice, weakness, and dizziness.
I must go to that job.
We have already done this, but said that those who registered in April will only receive money at the end of the month.
We need a pass for four, we are going to the doctor with the children.
But one night a lady wrote to me who liked your work and wanted something from you in her house.
I'm expecting news from her and will definitely let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, investing a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex, demanding, and intellectually challenging job that I was completely disillusioned with.
It's a shame to have wasted time, but it's a life lesson.
In my personal life, I am outgoing but single-minded and serious about marriage.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I believe that for a family to be created, people must love, respect, and trust each other.
I haven't encountered that yet.
Good day. Where in Iglav can I buy baking molds (paper or silicone)?
Alright, thank you for the advice, I will now enter my certificate into the form for Valy.
She has CP in a lying position, her leg is now broken in plaster, the wheelchair is in a lying position, all the food is blended in a blender.
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Reichard, at this late hour.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's game room today to say hello to her.
She found herself in an unpleasant situation.
When the children were leaving, one mother refused to take her child home because she said she had come to look at things and arrange them in the clothing room and Mr. Valery had opened our children's room for her until 19:00 yesterday.
Is it really possible?
The room's working hours are up to 4:00 PM.
And ultimately, that is our responsibility.
But I have very slow internet and the page won't load or open.
Good day, all is well here) Kolya is working, we filled out invitations yesterday, and I was helping the seniors with their exam prep for high school.
The hardest homework to do right now is geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Vika is researching universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and Wifi?
