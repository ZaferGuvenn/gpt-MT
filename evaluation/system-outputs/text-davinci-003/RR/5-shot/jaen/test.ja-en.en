When I tried to buy the entry package, two packages came out, blue and orange.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What's the difference?
Please tell me because I couldn't find out by researching.
It should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They are the same, just look different.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu.

Jiu-Jitsu

I don't feel like watching TV anymore because there are so many of those things...
Is it because the comedians are forced to do something? Television is all about comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
It's creepy that people laugh at everything a popular comedian says, even if it's not funny at all.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood, and it won't be pleasant to work with them.
It's like the old black companies, that industry is like a sports club, and some entertainers have too much ego and take a nasty attitude, so they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who constantly talk about how hard their job is and say "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until it starts to sell, but it's like being told every time that being an entertainer is a difficult job and standing at the top of the job.
It sounds like a justification for the over-representation of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own careers.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the things related to the entertainment industry are becoming more and more unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from the Tsutomu Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale, and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I had to return it.
It's more of an online shopping trouble than a custom PC topic, but I can't make sense of it no matter how I think about it, so I'll write it here since it's a famous place.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen on the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the page for the wired version to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Yodobashi), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order confirmation email and the shipping confirmation email the next day.
In these two emails and in the purchase history of my page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here's the problem, I got an email a few hours after shipping saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email.
They were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
Since we already shipped the wired mouse,
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
Return the mouse only for a refund.
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your compatibility.
The wired and wireless versions have separate product pages, but it seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version, even though it was written as wireless in the purchase history, email, and delivery note.
Isn't it unfair to send a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and then demand a refund if we want to return it?
Please lend me your wisdom, as I ultimately want to accept the refund or retaliate in one shot.

Why does it matter?
For example, people who have cut ties with their parents or siblings.
Don't worry about it.
The reason why relationships are bad is because there are various personalities and unreasonable people, even among parents and siblings.

Isolated Twice...Bridge Connecting District to Outside World Collapses Due to Typhoon and Heavy Rain, Residents Increase Stockpile of Food Threefold (Fukushima Prefecture Yatsuka Town) (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara district in Yamafuku-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a big impact on the lives of the 8 people in the 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like, 'Really?'"
"It felt like it was broken so quickly, like it was swept away," said the only road connecting the Takahigahara district, the Takahigahara Bridge, which was swept away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 residents of 11 households in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to go without water had to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually off-limits, to transport the necessary supplies every day.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually I can drive to the garden, but this time I had to get off the car and carry or carry it on my back to cross the iron bridge and come here, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge was completed a month later, but it was isolated again for a few days until the temporary bridge was put in place due to heavy rain in less than three months.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto is continuing to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I'd like to make sure we have enough food for two or three days," said the mayor, who has stocked up on canned food and cup noodles that can be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, and you never know when a disaster will strike you, so I felt again that it would be better for everyone to have some supplies. On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away.
The town started its own initiatives in 2021 to not forget the lesson.
Ryuuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Division of Yatsuri Town: "We have established October 12th as "Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day" and we have announced that we would like to use this day to think about disaster prevention from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.
Articles at the time of purchase.
The test itself is almost finished, so all that's left is to write the report, but we are also doing a follow-up test to make sure the measurements are correct, so please wait a bit.
I understand why you would lose confidence in the measurement results.
Do you think Yuzuru Hanyu's ranking would have been different if the Olympics were not in China?

So that it will be the same wherever it is done.

I'm sorry, I don't know anything about support groups, but it seems like there might be some if you look for them...
I remember from Hiro-yuki's video that the bad person who was getting along with his parents said something like if you go to the organization that provides food, clothing and shelter, they will somehow help you even if they tell you not to go (I'm not sure). So I think there must be such an organization.
Experience a Paralympic Marathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympics.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of tourism in Tokyo through digital.
Running machines and road bikes were provided at the venue, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment and ran on a virtual marathon course reproduced in the virtual space.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing participants from both inside and outside the country to experience a race competing with each other while running a marathon course, and also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery was really different and really enjoyable."
"It's tough running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's really fun to run while enjoying it, and it's great to be able to compete with everyone and do our best until the end," said the Tokyo official. "We want people to be able to enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up after the New Year.

"Building Condition Survey System" Pitfalls (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Aiming to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system is doing well in used housing transactions.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
As the trend of living in one's own home has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale", and "tower", and this has also had an effect on the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act in part, and started a building condition survey, called an inspection, for the purpose of secure and safe transactions of used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system where an architect who is knowledgeable about housing checks the current state and condition of the property, including deterioration, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, which gives the buyer peace of mind.
This can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the used house they are planning to buy and to purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party in charge of building condition surveys is usually the seller.
In addition, attention should be paid to the fact that only the announcement of the inspection system was made obligatory.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of the mediation has the obligation to explain whether or not they can introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property, but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where risks are concerned with seller-led inspections.
Before a residential sale, the buyer will request an inspection of the building from an expert called an "inspector" or "building surveyor".
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" is in the driver's seat to conduct the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are vastly different from the "seller" main inspection.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, to sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are looking to inspect the survey and make the necessary repairs so they can feel secure in living there.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the intentions and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection survey based on the seller-led inspection prescribed by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned case can also be called a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility of an inspection being carried out with "leniency", such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

It was pretty tough.
But mentally I was healed, so I was full of motivation.
I sometimes fell asleep during work because my body wouldn't keep up with me, since I was a researcher.
Since it was the second time in a year, I was thinking of taking a break for a month and parting ways with the shitty company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't work, so it dragged on for a long time.
Anyway, it is important to go to a psychiatric hospital and get the proper treatment, as well as to have a record of visits (very important).
Even if you resign for personal reasons, if you have a medical history, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the doctor's judgment, so the hurdle to receive unemployment insurance etc. will be drastically lowered.
Even if you can't find a job, or if you just want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history in the unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As we were walking around Ginza, she suddenly broke the silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula, you know."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza, the synonym for the bustling town that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" was a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawamachi", but when it moved to Rikagakumachi it became known by the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a bay called Iri-gawa extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo-mae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now where Ginza is located.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
And they cut the earth from the moat and cut down the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet.
There is a stone monument called "The Birthplace of Ginza" near the front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) which indicates the site of the former Ginza Town Hall, so those interested should try looking for it.
A "pilgrimage" to the Ginza, known only to those in the know.
In Ginza, there is an annual "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know called "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Meguri".
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after the performance.
On the other hand, the "Ryukou Fudouzon" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuzakaya, and the "Ginza Dejichizouzon" is on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Takadon Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by Ichimura Uzaemon, a kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the 1F entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
The "Inari Shrine" where a fox greets you in front of the shrine was built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, believing that it would bring the benefit of "abundant five grains" where the rice grows well.
As a result, it is said that business prosperity was beneficial in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and faith spread even in Ginza, the most prosperous city in Japan.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain like hypersensitivity when I pressed or touched my front tooth.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to help relieve the pain quickly.
Will the severe pain I feel when I touch my tooth before treatment go away in a few days?
The painkillers don't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.

Recruiting: How to Compile Scripts & How to Modify Existing MOD Scripts
I looked around a lot and tried my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that, so I can start from MO2 without running scripts or resources, but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but it only has instructions on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the script of an existing MOD and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...

[Serious Question] How did foreign people in Japan find work? [Escaping from Dispatch]
My friend is currently looking for programming and IT jobs in the Kansai area (currently on dispatch), but it doesn't seem like there are many jobs in Osaka or other major cities on LinkedIn *sobs*
How did everyone find their jobs?
I feel like they're really stressed out, so I want to help them somehow...
I'm not sure if I should ask here, but I would be really happy if anyone had any good ideas.
Edit: I'm very happy to see everyone's great answers.

Body of Man Found in Shonai River in Moriyama District of Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City, dead.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoji River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died on the spot.
The police are investigating the cause of death while quickly confirming the identity.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river at Sakagawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disorder in the men's clothing, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the situation at the time.

South Korea's Posco International Acquires Australia's Senex Energy, Expands Overseas Gas Field Business - Korean Report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it has signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending approval of the resolution at the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and other local procedures.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was 7709 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy 49.9%.
Posco International explained that it has decided to acquire the company, as natural gas demand is expected to continue to increase even in the energy transition era, and blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the hydrogen market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operation personnel in Australia.

That knee pain, could it be "osteoarthritis"?!
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's Note: I have been having persistent knee pain lately.
What kind of illnesses are possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be various, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surfaces of the joints are covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make the movement of the joints smoother.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial: Does osteoarthritis affect joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
It can also occur in joints other than the knee, such as the fingers of the hand, the base of the thumb, the neck, the waist, the big toe, and the hip joint.
But the most common is the case of the knee, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together in a concave and convex shape.
The part where the two bones meet is covered by the articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by the joint capsule.
Editorial: So it has a complex structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovium, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
The reason why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movement is because of this.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: The articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushioning role, so to speak.
However, if it wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
It's usually pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the wash, I sleep in sweats or something!
Are there people who can quit smoking even if they are heavy smokers, and people who cannot quit smoking?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but he quit completely.
He said he had a feeling to stop, and he ended up stopping without doing anything.

Experience the Gambling & Games 3 Selections of the "Kaiji" Series (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" which boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game of life and death.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your feet tingle... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to examine the Kaiji games that can actually be played or are practiced in planning videos.
Swamp: A pachinko machine full of traps that appeared in the gambling-breaking record "Kaiji".
In the original work, Kaizi was shocked by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was set up with large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono" and "3-Step Cruen", and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible, and in the end resorted to a wild plan of placing a vinyl tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, and he succeeded brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji is actually a pachinko machine and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held as a pastime by the wealthy, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in the "Human Horse Racing" Iron Crossing.
The debtors proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin iron frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participate and the top two can win a prize, but there are only four iron beams and the safety measures are inadequate, so the chances of dying are quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but it can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and ahead of it are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which you can walk to.
Of course, security measures have been taken.
Comedian Corera Kōran released a video on his YouTube of himself walking the Eagle Bridge, saying "You can experience a steel bridge in Japan", and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Play with 10 cards, one Emperor card, eight Citizen cards, and one Slave card, divided into the Emperor side and the Slave side.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Rinkai-gawa under the strict rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
Kaiji eventually realized that he was being read by a device that was destroying his ears like the earphones he had attached, by sensing changes in pulse and body temperature and sending them. He then managed to win by shaving his ears to the extreme and throwing off the readings of Riken River.
The E-card is commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the new year, gently pushing forward - Tora's great horse at the prefectural shrine | Yamagata Shimbun.
At Yamagata Prefectural Kōkoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive horse for the zodiac animal of next year, the Tiger, has appeared.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to paint the votive tablets since the year before last.
This time, out of the nine works painted by the Japanese painting course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suehara Toshiaki, the work of Yuichi Tsuchiya (22) was adopted.
The large votive horse is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at the center.
Tsuchiya said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
The sight of the tiger standing still and admiring the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, we can still have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature".
Tsuchiya's design is also featured on the ema generally distributed.
Kunegi Chiba Kenichi (44) of Gonenegi said, "I think it will be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's Think About "Living in Tamano" - City High School Students Hold Workshop to Propose Ideas: San-yo Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", we will compile the voices of young people and make proposals to the mayor.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer out loud such as "when having fun with many people" and "when drumming".
The first meeting was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the "World Cafe" method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems like a town with a lot of young people would be interesting." "Living there would require having access to transportation like trains and buses."
Let's talk further to see if there are any common points.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said an 18-year-old student from Tamano Commercial High School.
The 18-year-old student from Binan High School said, "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be surrounded by nature," and seemed to have noticed not only the issues of the area but also its charm while talking with adults.
The second meeting in December will be attended by high school students only, to organize the proposals.
We plan to announce it in February next year with the mayor and the education director invited.
The chairman of the center, Higuri, said, "We hope to foster a sense of attachment to the local area among high school students, and to provide an opportunity for young people to take an active role in town development."

How to Find the New Way of Strolling (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Scarves are essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
It is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after tying it, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be wrapped quickly, and then I found something innovative.
The COTTORI brand of stoles have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is like a net pattern.
The mesh of the net has been made so that the edges of the mesh can pass through.
So you can wind it up without connecting the ends.
Light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people will combine them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is really interesting.
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed movie.
It feels like a raw, life-sized Beatles, and it's all so fresh...
We're on the brink of disbandment, so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
Paul, who was grumbling something like "I know I'm annoying but come on!", George, who was complaining in a half-hearted way with a "But see~", John, who was saying his opinion and jokes calmly but was always late and didn't seem motivated, and Ringo, who was playing the role of the peacemaker but wasn't very active and was sitting in the back with a troubled face...
We weren't so much enemies that we would fight, but there was a very common feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. It's like a legendary breakdown or something.
And in that atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
It's crazy how a small phrase can turn into an amazing song just by going back and forth with "What do you think of this?"
Especially the moment when the Get Buck is finished is amazing.
The scene where a subtle hum gradually turns into a Zucha♪ Zucha♪ with lyrics is recorded perfectly.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it's not often seen.
And of course, everyone is greased up, so just watching the performance scene makes you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three, but so far it seems like the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
Even though the four of them complained a lot, they seemed to enjoy making music. But when it came to talking about where to do the live performance, the producer and the promoters would start talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying something like "Let's make them the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that the four of them had no say in the matter.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it was the reason why there were so many scenes where Paul seemed like the bad guy.

I thought that because you have such a serious personality, you must be feeling a sense of responsibility and it's making you lose your peace of mind.
Now it's a bit hard to keep living, isn't it?
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I found that I'm really suited for sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it's been much easier to work.
I was asked about what I couldn't do, but I think if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, it will make my life a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and relax before considering this.
I think there is also daily life, so if there is a union or industrial doctor of the company or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there because there may be some system.
I hope I can live a little more comfortably in the future.

Tornadoes Ravage the US with Unseasonable Warmth and Strong Cold Influences (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
Tornadoes broke out across the southern United States from late Friday night to Saturday.
It is believed that the strong cold air that descended from the record-breaking warmth of this period caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature is expected to reach near 30°C on Thursday and Friday local time.
Due to a strong cold air mass descending from around 5500m in the upper atmosphere, a large temperature difference formed a vigorous front line, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front line.
It appears that tornadoes have been occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warnings issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday (10th) local time.
This reveals two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a strong tornado reached EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which indicates the strength of a tornado, the third strongest out of six levels, with gusts of wind reaching around 70 m/s in an instant.
Future investigations may also determine it to be EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, based on the Fujita scale, adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
The JEF3, equivalent to the tornado in the US this time, is likely to occur in Japan as well, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

Voices calling for help from beneath the "largest in history" rice-cake roll from live broadcast (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
On April 11th (Japan time April 12th), President Biden expressed his view with a solemn expression that "one of the largest tornadoes in US history" had caused damage in the Midwest and South of the United States.
Reported by US CNN TV, etc.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can".
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which was hit by tornadoes, residents carry furniture and other household items from damaged houses. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
The record of the damage caused by the tornado is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925, which affected Missouri and other states, but a meteorologist from CNN estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers), which was the largest scale.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was heavily affected, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas season, also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were employed, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
A woman, trapped under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick in the darkness, felt the weight of the rescuers searching above the rubble and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In the broadcasted live stream, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the sound of a woman seemingly singing "Happy Birthday To You" while crying in an attempt to mask her fear could also be heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
He looked back and said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, like something was erupting."
The police officers of the Mayfield City Police Department said that the search operations will continue until they are no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, a warehouse of internet retail giant Amazon collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of the cars being detached, and highways are also being blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 households, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to do more?
Consume high-protein foods and drinks.
Avoid rough-cut vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

It's tough to get welfare...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resorts that could provide both an address and an income source, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus.
I did a quick search and found this site↓,
Live-in Part-time/Full-time Jobs - Live-in Job Search Navi (Sumina Navi)
There is a related search for "bargain live-in work", so it seems like there are a lot of colleagues like that.
Opening a bank account or signing up for a line contract can be done with just an address for the first time, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update them without an address (since a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does a specialist in gynecology mean as a doctor?
A "senior specialist" is a doctor in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "specialist doctor" and "postgraduate trainee doctor".
The so-called "resident" refers to the "initial resident", which refers to doctors in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, I will be able to do some medical treatment by the fourth or fifth year, so I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries deduct points from a base of five stars, Japan claims to add/deduct points from a neutral three stars.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean something completely different, "there are elements that detract from the work" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we base our ratings on five stars, then "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used and such operations are not given three stars (bad reviews), I understand why you would not want to give them.
So trying to argue against those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a binary rating system on Steam won't work.

Is there a USB powered submersible pump that can fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity from USB is up to about 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump depends on the model, but at least 500W, so it's impossible.

The Roll of Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was a different radio than the one I was tuning into.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right?
So here's the thing, I was supposed to make an AM radio but it seems like I'm getting an FM radio instead.
Why do you think that? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp for SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
Mods that use ESP for distributing textures and meshes do not need an ESP if they are deployed as loose files in the appropriate location.
I saw something about it somewhere, but I can't remember where...
I understand the risks, so I'm not actually going to do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, please let me know if it is okay to do.
Thank you for your post.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" "Freshly Fried Fish and Shrimp Fried with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Living / Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento Box with Freshly-Caught Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Fries and Homemade Tartar Sauce.
Takeout specialty store "Hakobune" with colorful bento and deli (souzai) using plenty of vegetables.
The couple, Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi (38), opened last August with the aim of "letting people enjoy a restaurant-like atmosphere at home".
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly-Caught Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Fries with Homemade Tartar Sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available in the market at the time.
"The fly is made with thin coating of raw bread flour so that you can feel the texture of the ingredients," (Kiyoshi-san) said, and the shrimp fly has a crispy texture that can be felt directly.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes and vegetables, a portion of rice with mixed grains and Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture, and soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the homemade field next to the house, or from direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as the "familiar and comforting taste" of dashimaki tamago (Yumi-san).
The bento box "Hand-kneaded Domestic Mixed Meat Hamburg Steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried it out.
Ride comfort It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not enough to make you dizzy).
Speed, of course, is slow.
Safety - I think it's safe because it slows down or even stops completely when there are people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It hurts to be looked at by the people around me; it's not bad to be seen, but it feels like they're thinking "What a nuisance". It hurts my heart.
Overall, it was not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
However, since it is also relaxing and you can enjoy the scenery while riding slowly, I thought it would be better if there were fewer people on board.
It was a ride that was quite difficult for those who are not very patient, with a sense of excitement for the near future of this kind of autonomous driving becoming mainstream, and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but there is no eel used in this bowl of rice.
The answer is actually "Nas!" (Tap to reveal the answer!)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone was just eating it with sauce and that anything other than the grilling was fine, but then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.

A man was cut with a knife and escaped on a motorcycle in Saga City Otsu on the 12th, attempted murder case | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "there is a fight".
The man sustained a wound about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who escaped was a medium-built, bald man.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated that there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Road of a Family Planting Environmental Protection Activities at the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
Kato Yuki: Corporate Consultant for Find Asia in Hong Kong. China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection by the local government, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna) in Southwest China is also one of these areas.
Li Wenda, the younger sister, is currently an actress. The Xishuangbanna region is located at the border of Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group, which shares its roots with the Thai Kingdom.
The source of the Mekong River flows through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people (Xishuangbanna Dai) covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua in Sechuan Province and hear about her environmental protection activities.
Starting Environmental Protection Activities with her German Husband - She has been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The impetus for this was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and has come to Seesapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and was renowned for its rich biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest took place in order to root industry in this region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met and married a journalist I knew.
Did Mr. Li have any interest in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Li, I am from Ciudad Panama, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
So she had to push the project forward with her husband without any knowledge of it.
I sometimes see people who don't have a particularly attractive face or tall stature, but have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out when you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong inner confidence.

It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I don't quite understand what you mean by "praise and be specific" since I've never been told that before.
I wonder if it was something like praising in detail.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
I replied, "My heart is blooming with Sakura's confession. I'm looking forward to getting to know you."
And to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
If I choose not to open a NISA account when opening a Rakuten Securities account, can I open one at a later time?

[Omakan/Personal Note] Something that caused CTD in the MOD self-circuit environment and took about one and a half months to identify.
In March, due to the lack of time to play during the GW period, CTDs caused by multiple factors occurred, and it took a long time to identify them, mainly during holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dlls and meshes don't leave a crash log.
Major CTD Timings
Do not leave any traces in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the logging type.
* When accumulating kills/attacks on some NPCs: Activated even with console kill → Improved with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF * Is there a possibility of wet clothes for this?
For some NPCs, the camera work for activating kill moves has been improved by setting the kill move setting to OFF via .ini: there is a conflict in the settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
* (Basic Outdoor) Field Movement + Partial Magic (e.g. Ice Rune) Activation, NPC Hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID Use NPC Application Setting (Top Right of MCM) All OFF, 5 consecutive attempts to improve everything.
Is it due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, the default .ini for SPID usage in 2.0 has a formatting mistake, but as a result, the NPC should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
Initially, I focused on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dlls) heavily, and this is the result.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
In case there are any people in the Japanese environment who have the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it as a memo.
Most of us are doing it on the brink of our mental limits.
Nobody around notices it, not even colleagues or family.

But he probably has a very fragile mental state.

Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric visit nursing - reflections on today's visit nursing
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also do the necessary things for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply moved by how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication through today's home visit nursing.
Today we had a discussion, or rather a gender debate, about the differences between men and women.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desires, or why she got divorced, or is it okay to talk about such things in home visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations at psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or medical personnel with a top-down attitude give instructions such as "This is a medical facility" even when occupational therapists come for visiting nursing.
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really good, facing me with equality and frankness, even though I have a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits, and there may be people who are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
Let's take it if the doctor approves.
And let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts because I could not agree on the terms.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One-Fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japanese Version) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced its Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation by 2022, and to operate 310 hydrogen stations across the country.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (about 577 yen).
However, by November this year, the target of 27% (about 17,000 units) for fuel cell vehicles will not be met.
The target for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the price per kilogram of hydrogen is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's performance of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap was significantly below the target value.
The National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) announced on the 12th a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
South Korea is ranked fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative).
However, the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions reported that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that the other countries are at a disadvantage in terms of competition".
The country-by-country patent rankings are China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Korea exceeded Japan (974) with 1033, ranking fourth, but it was still at 22% of China's (4721).
The All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large amount of investment and research and development expenses tax deductions."

Furthermore, an address is required for the line contract.
So make sure you don't cancel your smartphone line contract...
And even if we manage to get by with the comic cafe and daily payments for now.
Don't forget to secure your address as it is the top priority.
It is important to sleep on a futon, and simply having a bank account or a debit card, or receiving government services, requires an address.
Living allowance should be able to be applied for without an address, but it would be a rare case.
What does this mean in terms of the double-edged saw, as there is soon to be a technical test on it?

Do you get paid for volunteering?
There are some naive people who mistakenly think that volunteers must be unpaid.
There are also paid volunteer opportunities.
For example, drug trials are usually volunteer work that pays a reward.
There are often people who mistakenly think that it is a good deal.
Was the number of older sisters and wives during the Meiji to Showa period smaller compared to now?
It seems that the elder sister had many wives.
It's been said that the phrase "sister-in-law" has become popular.
And, in those days, it was said that "even if you have to wear a golden sandal, look for a wife who is one year older than you." So I think there were more wives who were older than now in the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime to sell something at a higher price than the list price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at stores for 70,000 yen.
It is lawful.
Since it is free competition, for example, if the brand item has increased in scarcity value from the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and have their prices go up.
The reason why PS5 is being sold at a high price is because of its rarity value and its value has increased from the original price.

A meeting on Sunday?
TV-style flyer creation is underway in Takasu, with the Diet reform, and the "communication book" of the Diet members: Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition.
The Town Council of Takasu is undertaking unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople interested.
On the 9th, approximately 1,800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts to inform people of the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th.
"Asa Kara Nama Giron", "Tetsuko no Heya", "Sawaguchi Hito Tantei Series"...
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th had catchy phrases reminiscent of popular TV shows.
Hyoe Katayama (43), the newly elected member of the Diet, said, "I want to come to the Diet with a smile on my face."

US Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engage in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12th.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be shipped to Ukraine after the New Year.
According to a Pentagon spokesman, the aid included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's reinforcement of forces near the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance against Russian military movements, and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response in case Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, the total amount of aid has risen to over 25 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, state troops from Florida were sent to Ukraine in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the Inheritance and Gift Tax "Review" to make "Forbidden Hand" of lifetime gifts, directly hitting former Tax Commission Chairman Masaru Amari of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year's holidays!"
It is called "Pre-mortem Gift and Rush Inheritance".
While discussions on the integration of inheritance and gift taxes are ongoing, the proposed tax reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year was not included, but there is a high possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, Member of the House of Representatives, Amane Aki, we will teach you everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques that will make it in time for the year-end rush of gifts.
(Diamond Editing Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
From wealthy people to city employees, "forbidden hands" are used for pre-death gifts. "From the perspective of taxing inheritance and gift taxes more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards building a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer."
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what it is saying is that it will change the rules of inheritance and prohibit the "gift before death" which is the orthodox way of inheritance tax measures, in order to increase inheritance tax.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property".
The strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all this, the discussion of "integrating inheritance and gift taxes" emerged.
Although the fastest introduction was not included in the outline of the fiscal year 22 tax reform announced on December 10th, which was a concern, "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system", "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are from (omitted) a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount, so (omitted) a policy towards integration was again proposed with more detailed wording.
Former LDP Tax System Research Committee Chairman, Aoki Masaru, former Secretary General, said in an interview with this editorial department.
It is most important to lose the advantage and disadvantage of the timing of asset transfer and to make the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration, and if the amendment is passed quickly, there will be three chances left for lifetime gifts.
Even without that, it seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken towards invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax avoidance measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift taxes change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
The story is a heartbreaking pure love story of a man and a woman who carry the past, based on the same-named manga by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018. The heroine is played by Yamatani Kachun.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa and the heroine, Risae, is played by Yamayagi Kajun.
Riso, a college student, meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kairi, who is suffering from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Riseto's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but is Kairi a murderer due to a certain incident?
Yudai Furukawa Comment Drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were unable to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the work by seeing the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Risou, as well as their struggles and changes.
We are happy if even the fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

NFL: Team Wins with 3 Passes in One Game - How Did the Players Feel? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in this game.
This was only a few times since 1974 in Week 3 when the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had the once-in-a-lifetime talent of O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to surpass 2,000 yards in the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton's run.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, with the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s and snow before the game.
Bill, being from the area, didn't change his play selection much.
Ran passed 25 times out of 30.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was never impossible.
There were four red zone penetrations in the ten offensive series and scoring machines.
Especially in the late third quarter, it advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to steal three points in three FG1 attempts.
Goal-line defense in the final minutes of the match.
The Bulls committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Diggs ran a slant route and was open in the end zone, but it didn't seem to register with Allen.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in a failed attempt.
Brian was man-to-man covering Bills WR Call Beadley, but he reacted to Allen's movement by letting go of Beadley and going for the pass.
Allen, who had missed two receivers, threw two passes targeting the end zone.
The fourth down pass may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown on the third down.
You need to get a first down in two plays.
It was still two minutes before the fourth and short, so Allen's own run should have been alive with his ability.

It's time to replace the items you keep in your kitchen for a long time - Harper's BAZAAR's 3 picks for "Throw Away Time" and "Replacement Time" (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge.
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as often as recommended.
Research from 2017 has shown that kitchen sponges can still be a breeding ground for bacteria, even if they are microwaved daily (though microwaving is still recommended).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board.
The United States Department of Agriculture suggests that cutting boards should be replaced when they become scratched or grooved.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria can proliferate.
If still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry with either air or a clean paper towel, patting lightly to remove excess water.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also be the cause of chapped lips or spilled drinks in the missing parts.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged General Guan Yu, posted by Builder Yojin.
General Guan Yu of the Water-Submerged Army: "Hey, Yu Jin!"
Yu Jin said, "No!"
"Yu Jin won't die even if 30,000 arrows come down on him."
"Ussu!"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Ussu!"
"Even if I'm swallowed by the muddy waters of the Han River, I won't die."
"Ussu!"
"So can the Water Attack Water Bridge withstand three quarters of an hour?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"So practice hard so you can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Woo-hoo!"
Is it a promise?
"Got it, Wuss!"
"I won't know if you get killed by Cao Cao someday!"
Saying that, the loyal general left and returned.
Of course, there's no way we're doing practice drills like water attack, underwater bridge, and three-quarter time! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and sink them in a cage.
Did you read the article at the link you quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
The Community Market uses Steam's payment system.
This feature allows for red packet transactions with strangers, so there have been cases of people being scammed out of items without receiving any money.
That won't happen.
Trade is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different conversation?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There can be regular employees even in simple labor, and there can also be non-regular employees even in intellectual labor.
Help me finish FlashBIOS.
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 I bought in September and put it in my Tomahawk.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen was black with a white cursor-like dot that was not blinking and stayed there.
I tried to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS was corrupted, but it wouldn't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be that the USB memory is too old, or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you been sleeping too much and become lazy?
Is there any other likely cause?

[First-time Limited 1,980 yen/Free Shipping] The "true hair care line" that leads to the hair you really want/#Product2#
For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
You can carry items that are not too conspicuous, but you cannot carry items like Louis Vuitton with the monogram and the "Lv" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get one that fits your size.
By the way, I think it would be nice in Japan.
In Japan, it is . . .
It has nothing to do with being a layman.
I should have said it earlier, "Why do you only call me by my first name/talk to me in a casual way?"
If it starts to feel like it doesn't matter because they're a foreigner, it's best to simply say it's unpleasant.
I don't think I ever dreamed of having an uncomfortable feeling with a somewhat decent probability.
I used to live abroad, and when I went out, the Japanese people, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people there, and I think they misunderstood that they could say whatever they wanted to the locals.
If it looks like a Westerner, I think it's done without any malice, as a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling.
My friends from Europe and the US call each other by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, I sometimes get a bit confused about which one to use.
Well, it's okay if it's just friends.
It's probably just something he's doing normally, but if you overlook it, he might get away with it thinking he's an exception, so it's better to say something now while you can.
Could you please talk to me according to Japanese rules because I'm from Japan?
Study: My white friend who is naturalizing always raises his glass higher than the younger people at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but it's a good habit because if I do it that way, I won't be treated strangely by people younger or older than me, like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of personality, are so meticulous that there are people (including me) who are annoying.

Actually, as of yesterday, there were only 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
If anyone who subscribed to this sub-reddit today could tell me in the comments where they heard about it, I would really appreciate it! (I'm really curious since I have no idea)
Since there is only one person currently making threads, it would be appreciated if everyone could make threads as well.
Even without creating a thread, it would be encouraging to receive comments.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please make sure to start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The sub-group I made before didn't gather people as I expected and I gave up soon, but this time I can continue without giving up thanks to everyone.
We will continue to work hard to maintain the wiki and rules, etc., to make the subreddit easier to use, so please continue to support us!
As expected, it was untouched by the snow.

If we keep making such exaggerated forecasts, I think the viewers will stop believing us.
Did you accumulate in the city?
Please just let it go!
Since I only have a limited ability to understand English, I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text has a bit of a strange feel to it, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue to play (I'm just feeling this way, so it might be good to ask others as well).
I often see translations of this level in games made overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like they are usually well translated.
I think it is possible for non-native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese after a long period of study.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I suggest you look for someone else.

The analysis is that training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Effort Equivalent Exchange" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the amount of training it has.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles and training is done day and night, is not popular with readers.
It can also be inferred from the fact that, even though there was a two-year training period when the Straw Hat Pirates separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", they only touched on it and the rest was glossed over.
Well, one-piece dresses are attractive because of their eccentricity in wandering lands, but "staying in the same place and training" doesn't always go well with them.
The training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and Giyu said, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are all forced down by the strong with power...
While saying that, Yoshiyuki introduced Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains the applicants of the Demon Slayer Corps, as a kindness (even though he is a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and Tanjiro was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied with a single punch, "You're slow to judge."
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange among fans that has become a topic of conversation.
But taking his sister, who has become a demon, with him carries the possibility that he will be forced to make such a decision at some point.
It can be said that this is an initiation into practice from a mental attitude.
Rin Tatsumi, who has not yet trained, takes Jyushimatsu to the narrow fog mountain and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, slingshots, and traps, and it seems like one could die before even starting the training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he can barely detect the faint smell of the trap set by a person, and barely manages to avoid it, which is called the "protagonist correction".
Even so, it is the essence of Kimetsu no Yaiba to make Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so much more physically capable that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is just being able to use the power and skills that have been honed up to that point to their full potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded accordingly and those who do not put in effort are not rewarded, is a human anthem that differs from the supernatural power of the Oni, and is a difficult rule to move away from that is consistent throughout this work.

I think there are a lot of people like that.
Shall we play a game?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fit my idea of "stubbornness".
I think of "gemetui" as trying to get more benefit than effort with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea Establishes 'DX Division' Integrating Home Appliances and Mobile, 'Emphasizing User Experience' (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions into a single Set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name the division DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that its newly launched DX division, which integrates the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network.
Samsung Electronics officials explained that the name change reflects a mid- to long-term business structure, future-orientedness, and the strengthening of global leadership.
He also emphasized the intention to enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies on a company-wide scale and build a foundation for differentiated products and services that transcend organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through inter-device linkage based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the Common Era?
How would you say that in Japanese?
It was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for non-Christians, it has become more common in recent years to write it as BCE.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

This is Empire of the Undergrowth, right?
I remember seeing it because I also supported it on Kickstarter and was working on translating it into Japanese.
There may be a matter of preference, but I don't think the "desu/masu style" would fit a natural science documentary with a low-voiced male narrator.
I would like it to be expressed in a more heavy and stiff way.
They lie in wait, their jaws primed, with only their armored heads visible from the sand. Anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
The Hanmyou larvae lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey at any time, showing only their disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid lie in wait in the sand, ready to seize their prey at any moment, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about is...
Did you refer to any other documents?
Seeing it from an ant's perspective.
Is that so?
Translating "armoured heads" as "circular heads" would make the part about "a giant beast wearing a helmet in ant scale" disappear...
Aichi 24-Vehicle Collision, Truck Driver Has No Pre-Existing Conditions, Carelessness Suspected (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no pre-existing illness and that it appears that some kind of carelessness caused the accident.
At 10am on the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the first collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of the suspect Nomura continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that the suspect Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises of the contacts and investigating the situation at the time in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, will be concluded in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks focused on a single battle!
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling is already starting before the match!
In short, this four-volume series is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, through the mutual tug-of-war competition and special training scenes, it's quite different from before and it doesn't lead to a match, but it's never boring.
The tension of the story gradually increasing as the century-long war is about to begin is certainly connected to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly a calculated performance even in this period, making one marvel.
And before the important finals, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
I like the extravagance of the match card, but what I like most is before the match, when Ramenman is facing a Kinnikuman poster and saying "From now on, I'm the one to beat!!"
He tried to chop it down.
But luckily, a passing Terryman caught the sword and stopped it, and after a silent stare, the scene ended with them parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, so there is no chance for them to fight against Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a fuss about this Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of the distant future and what great things it will do!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that still makes me feel as a manga artist that this is what it means!
The fight between the two ends without taking up much time, but the highlight of the scene is the appeal of Ramen Man's tears after the match.
Don't underestimate the power of God's luck towards Kinnikuman!!
That's the line.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers have been subtly feeling that Kinnikuman will ultimately win because he is the protagonist, even if it's not through strength.
But by making Ramenman say this, Yudetamago-sensei had already driven home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one sentence, the reader is left wondering, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman is actually going to beat Robin with his strength?"
How do I do it?
It will also stimulate our imagination for the unseen developments ahead, and from the perspective of a writer, this is like a self-imposed restriction on the creator of the work.
Wow, you did an amazing thing.
I'm sure this is one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aobayama in Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Takahama-cho Nakayama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
The winter illumination that began on November 26th (December 12th) has 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the promenade, lawn, and other areas, including a 20-meter-high cypress tree.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to come to Fukui after a long time and find such a place."
She said it was very beautiful and it made her feel relieved.
Illumination was first planned to give people a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with button pot performances and movie screenings.
I think only a few people can read through documents in order.
My friend who can read a lot told me that he was able to do it, but he was slowly building up his knowledge from the basics of Linux, rather than reading the documentation, he was reading from the parts that interested him in the table of contents of the reference book.
It is better to learn from Linux rather than directly touching something with a high degree of abstraction like Docker, as it is easier to understand and can be applied more easily.
It's quite difficult to just skip over it and understand everything all at once.
If you understand, that would be great...
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the content, just remember the parts you skimmed over and read them when necessary.

On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JA in the Okitama region, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which streams video and sells products over the internet.
The Yamagata Aizen Bujotai, who were first planned by Tokyo's Minato Ward, appeared remotely on the nationwide collaboration MINATO (Harbor) Market TV, delivering the charm of the region along with special products.

This morning, unfortunately...
The power to the NAS PC has gone out! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened.
Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
After a while, I noticed a pink rotor-like sound coming from the PC, so I shut it down first.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only getting worse due to the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not booting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up for a moment and the fan starts to move but stops immediately.
After that, he said nothing.
I tried unplugging the power plug and trying again, but it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Connected only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin and removed all other parts, but still unable to boot.
5.) I have heard a buzzing sound like something is hitting the PSU fan before, so I am suspecting that the PSU might be the cause.
I'll try to find an extra ATX power supply and give it a try later.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work out...I wonder what I should do.
Should I change the case and the motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?
Where did you see it?
Is it surrounded by nature?
I live in the Tohoku region.
There are people everywhere around me.
They are also in the garden and the company parking lot.

I want it to be consistent with that style.

Is there any card game like Gunbarlizing that can be played as a hobby?
I think it's a go.
