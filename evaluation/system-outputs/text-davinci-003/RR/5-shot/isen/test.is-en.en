Cry out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gotten off to a good start and the cries and calls out in nature are beginning to draw people from all over the world.
"You own the puzzle, I need Iceland," says a woman out in the big world in response to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube channel.
Another spectator declared that they will preserve Iceland in their heart forever and a young woman said she will definitely go to Iceland soon as her beloved is settled there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, so it looks like we will have to wait for another month.
Another spectator asks if the route to Iceland is feasible, since there are no planes.
It is not part of the story whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Thordarson from the advertising agency Peel, who created the ads in collaboration with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been better than expected.
"I have been to many Inspired By Iceland tours that have gone very well, but this new tour is already surpassing them.
At its core, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to talk about the expedition, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in around seven hundred media outlets around the world, which together reach approximately two billion people.
The value of that discussion is estimated at 1.8 billion kroner.
That's not acceptable.
The main market is the United States and the tour has been doing very well there even though Americans are not traveling to the country in a hurry.
According to Egil, markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as has Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then there have been responses from foreign areas, such as India, which was not particularly set up for.
"These ads have gone further than we expected," says Egill, noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The pictures at this opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer of Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements bearing the caption "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The shots were taken widely, such as at Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógafoss, at Sólheimajökull and in the cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti Productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of the lead characters were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Hundreds of Icelanders came to make the commercials, while at the same time another group was shooting on the South Coast and Westfjords.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland tour, with plans for a winter tour in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Iceland Office," says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone exceptionally well.
"It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about.”
Sprengisandur: Discussing the situation in the job market, pension funds and much more.
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social and Children's Affairs, will attend the Sprengisand meeting starting at ten o'clock at Bylgjunni today.
He is also the Minister of Employment and oversees the situation of the labor market as such, the Icelandair issue and other matters.
He also deals with rural affairs and transportation services to rural areas that have been performing poorly and have been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman of VR, will also be attending the show and will discuss his criticism regarding pension fund investments and present ideas on how labor unions and businesses should withdraw from the management of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then, Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel service provider in East Iceland, and Arnheidur Johannsdottir, Director of the Northern Region Marketing Office, will discuss the situation in travel services in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the autumn and ponder whether the success of the summer is a portent of what is to come.
You can listen to the episode below, but it starts at ten o'clock.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teen shows.
She gained fame though for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the shows Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn't accomplished much lately but she did manage to look back on her past and talk about Clueless on an Australian TV show recently.
She speaks fondly of Brittany Murphy who passed away unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person.
"I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script I knew who this person was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after an overnight stay.
Fifty cases were brought to the police force in the capital region today and the police logbook states that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from jail after being detained there for a DUI.
The man refused to leave after being released and ignored the police's instructions to leave.
The man earned himself a continuous stay at the police station due to his success.
A man was arrested this morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to take action against two people in Breiðholt due to a report of physical assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating in a shopping mall in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
Also, a car theft in the city center was reported this morning.
The driver of the white Renault van searched for her for a while and then she was taken into custody.
The car has not been found.
Curse of the Joyrider - The Terrible Fate of the Gleestars
The theory has gained traction on the internet that the cast of Glee is cursed, as actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third main cast member to pass away before their time.
The episodes of Glee are a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes revolved around a so-called joy club of teenagers in a high school, their loves and destinies.
It was not always taken for granted to be in the joyous group, but through singing and dancing the characters seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
Outside of the set, there have been major disruptions to the actors and crew of the show, so much so that theories have arisen that a curse lies on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, Glee, which didn't call all of her grandmothers.
After the show had run its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th of last year, it was announced that River was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped overboard and then Rivera had pulled him back into the boat but had never returned himself.
A massive search for Rivera was launched.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area concluded that the search should be conducted on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is said that she had encountered a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
Death cause was recorded as due to accidents caused by drunkenness.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, Glee, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to fame and respect.
Despite the roles, Moneith still shone with personal devils.
From the age of 13, he had been addicted to drugs and it proved difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show found it enough, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to be looking up.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a toxic mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a case of willfulness.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for stimulants had decreased so much that even small amounts he had previously tolerated were now proving fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His passing weighed heavily on his co-stars, but in support of his co-star Lea Michele, it was decided to continue shooting the episodes and dedicate them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee club members, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of trafficking child pornography.
During a home search at his place, a large amount of child pornography was found and the case was quickly made public.
It was clear that Salling had been done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison in addition to having to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had imposed the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the players of the show that fell far before their time.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He was suddenly taken in sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
Nancy Motes also worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great authoritarianism and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 after struggling with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her beloved in which she said her mother and sister, among others, were responsible for how she had come to be.
"My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me but the memory that it was they who bore all my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the shows.
She has recently been accused of using her authority and power inappropriately on the job and having an overly aggressive attitude.
Jesse Luken had a guest role in the episodes in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a great offense.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the episodes.
In 2010, she was the victim of computer hackers who obtained nude photos of her and posted them on the internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had a relationship outside of it.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had used violence in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It enhances the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents tending to flowers and getting to watch them grow and bloom.
There is also endless possibilities to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the air, and of course that precious time they had with their parents.
Bought himself a boat after the tenth grade.
"I don't think there are many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who does fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Beach fishing is a very convenient summer job when one is in school.
If fishing is done well, good income can be earned and I find it great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
"The earnings also serve me well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who goes fishing in the summer like the past summers.
Axel was the newest to dock at Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the start of the week.
"In the tenth grade I took a boating license for boats under twelve meters and I bought my boat the summer after I finished high school.
I have been fishing in my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat used from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after his name.
Hartmann was already an adult when I bought the boat and had stopped sailing and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
"Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half a million upfront in the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer when I was done fishing.
I had the boat debt-free by the end of my first summer on it.”
How could a boy have one and a half million to pay out for a boat when he had just finished high school?
"I had been saving up and collecting money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all summers fishing with him and got my share."
I also put my savings into my boat fund.”
Axel was born in Isafjordur, where all his family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the west because I have a residence permit with my grandmother in Isafjordur."
I learned in this area here west of rowing with dad.
I travel between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be westward, I have also traveled around Snæfellsnes and further.
I have also fished in the south, mostly for grayling,” says Axel, who always casts one early morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in his moments of solitude out on the beach.
"The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid trouble, but certainly something has been afoot at times, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In trawling I'm never more than 14 hours fishing in one go, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the lease quota, where I've been continuously fishing for one and a half solar cycles out at sea."
The regulations for beach fishing, he says, are such that he can catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds overwhelming.
"Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, during these four months that the coastal fishing season is in effect, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rush instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose according to their own will.
"So the zoning could also go my way and areas well situated for fishing should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the shallow sea on his beach fishing trips, but also occasionally catches some other species of fish.
Axel works over the winter season with his college course at the Núpi daycare in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors working in the country's kindergartens," says Axel proudly and adds that he had only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
"I got hooked on it because I find this job amazing.
"I hope that the psychology course will be useful to me in the future at the elementary school level," says Axel, who is also far along with his studies in business.
An error in registration prevented the homecoming quiz.
An error in the registration form that people fill out when entering the country caused an individual, residing here, to not be called back for inspection.
There is no requirement to provide a social security number if the individual fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be looked into this week," says an expert in the field of public health.
Three domestic cases were diagnosed at the Virology Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of them who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15th, two days after the rules on the so-called homecoming test took effect.
Those who were settled in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and again invited for a test four to five days later.
It was reported in the evening news on RÚV that the person in question had, however, followed the old system.
The inspection at the border was negative and he was not called back for the inspection for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of public health, says in an interview with the news agency that this may be attributed to an error in the digital registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to enter a social security number as is in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the concerned person has not received an automatic invitation to take the test.
Camilla says many have followed the homecoming exemption rules even though they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be looked into this week on how to make it easier for people to access this to draw attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been put in quarantine.
They all went to the screening but two were showing symptoms.
Containment is now underway for the three infections identified yesterday, and is mostly complete due to the two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the analysis of Icelandic genetics has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the ties have been directed towards Israel although it is known that the one who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says that it should be clear by tomorrow where the other wind is coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic cases have been identified in the country in recent days.
Of them, four are entirely unrelated and for example, the source of the infection that arose at the Rey Cup Sports Tournament yesterday has not yet been found.
Infection is still a problem.
Originally, thirty individuals were sent to quarantine but it was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine due to these new infections that were identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Johann K. Johannsson, Communications Manager of the National Police Commissioner's Department, says it is perfectly possible, as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
"We are constantly reminding all those living here that individual protective measures must be maintained.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
"Then it is possible to hold an event," says Johann.
He says it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individualized infection control measures.
Rules and criteria should also be in constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Health Protection Agency and the Public Health Department are constantly emphasizing to people, is to take these individual protective measures.
Both in-house and likewise with service companies.
People should wash their hands and use sanitizer.
"It prevents the spread of infection," says Johann.
"We need to encourage people to keep up the good work that we have been doing in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far."
40% of COVID-19 fatalities had type 2 diabetes.
Devon Brumfield heard over the phone how difficult her father was having to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to acute respiratory distress due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is fearful that he too may be headed for the same fate.
Reuters news agency reports that Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by US authorities show that around 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the ratio of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the ratio increases to one half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study took into account more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters conducted a survey and the responses from the 12 countries that responded were similar in proportion.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, have yet to recognize underlying illnesses.
"Diabetes was already spreading at a slow rate.
"Now COVID-19 has broken out like a powerful epidemic," Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among Blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fared worse from the coronavirus.
The best defense for those with Type 2 Diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and support from healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic has however made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
The high cost of insulin has caused some to continue to go to work and thus avoid being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities may have been aware of the risks posed to those with type 2 diabetes from the virus.
When SARS coronavirus spread in 2003, approximately 20% of those infected with the disease and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to need to be hospitalized.
When MERS made itself known in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the hospital had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the effects of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic could have uncovered a multitude of previously unknown side effects.
"I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
Recent research suggests that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes affects the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high ratio of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a real "sugar shock", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and overwhelms the body.
Impaired intake valves can also lead to turbulence which can again cause dangerous blood loss.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It all ties in together."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered a toast, so they left the barracks,"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were presented with the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother-in-law, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
"I was very impressed by her.
It was naturally just the outburst but it still seemed to me quite unbearably sweet.
"And still it stands," he says.
Asrun likes this too since her husband regularly recites the first verse.
"I'm always hearing this story.
"Just last weekend," she says, who was also smitten with her husband at first sight.
"I felt and still feel so much fuss around Atla, which I detest.
"There's a lot going on and a lot happening and I'm overwhelmed by it."
Atli says the couple has emphasized going their own way in their relationship.
"We don't tie our bags with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We get stuck in routines that we establish around us.
There may be a reason why they took the commission from Ragnar Kjartansson the artist just cheerfully, though it was to say the least unusual.
"Our mutual friend Kristín Anna has contacted us and asked if we can come to have dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörgu, Ragnar's wife, at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and got themselves a dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he was planning to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-screen video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Asrun says he described the work as a banal and decadent snapshot of the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and lastly he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in it."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was meant to show a young interracial couple in love in a minimalistic room.
"These are journeys with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar much although they had heard of him and he of them "but they knew us and it seemed to fit into this.
They had agreed that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others.”
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter but it didn't take long.
"When we ran out of Snaps we said: Aren't we just in this for the ride?"
That's just the way it is.
"I trusted Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"This is about love and closeness."
Senan was taken up in a fancy apartment on Myrargata Street.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar and the soundman and the pair.
After the recording had been switched on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn't decided anything on how we should be.
We got some minor instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
"There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
Was this romantic?
"Yes, this was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered a toast before they left the barracks.
It was kind of like being on a nice vacation in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi the viewer looked at this, he cried, it was so beautiful to him," says Atli.
"This is as much about love and care as it is about the relationships themselves," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard the voice in the piece at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized he was part of the work.
"She then turns around and starts to ponder this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this yet but then my dad sends me a message saying: "Nice to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo," Asrun recites.
And has the participation in the project deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"We are still together anyway so maybe this deepened something.
This deepened my connection with the extended family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"It was a bit hard for me not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works it was very nice.
I could somewhat detach myself from this and was just proud.
And there was this little bundle in my stomach," says Ásrún who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scan was taken.
"That was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli on Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous knockout match
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the previous game of the teams in the playoffs to get into the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0–0.
The home team in Swansea were awarded a penalty on the 64th minute and Andre Ayew blasted the ball off the penalty spot and let the keeper from himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, Brentford player, got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with one man down and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the numerical advantage.
Andre Ayew then added to the drama by scoring a superb goal and securing a 1–0 win for Swansea.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the match, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Wireless for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported yesterday that he wanted to have an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
It has not been smooth sailing for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst left her post as the US Ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Falcon Award.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be honored with the title.
After she left Iceland, she taught International Relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor took office, in September 2010.
It can be partly attributed to Robert S. Connan having been appointed as an ambassador but then resigning.
Finally, Louis Ariega took the job, having worked in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned from his position in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then began the second period of diplomaticlessness.
Robert Barber was approved by the US Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly afterwards, as no ambassador had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short-term campaign fund for Baracks Obama.
He resigned when Donald Trump took office as President on January 20th, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
Trump's administration was unusually quick to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington bureaucracy.
Two years passed until the US Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their meeting to question him on the matters and confirm upon completion as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the court, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, while his deceased wife had been of Dutch mountain descent.
Gunter is politically organized, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republican Party, Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded those organizations and Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter started working in Iceland in May 2019, and since early 2017, no ambassador had been in the country for two years and four months, which is the longest example here.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was taking to appoint people to key positions as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been drawn out significantly, including confirming ambassadors to posts.
Since 2009, there has been a total of five years without an ambassador in Iceland.
This has not prevented the activities of the embassy which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The operations are estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion and reinforced security walls encircle the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
It seems, however, not to have been enough to secure the current ambassador as he is said to fear for his life and has requested to be provided with armed protection.
Former IBV player faced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he still remembers coming to the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny that was published in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in the country where he played with IBV, Val and Throti in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland I didn't play in the midfield like I was used to playing.
The team captain was in that position but also had the jersey number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny who played on the right wing during his time with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is racism that he faced in Iceland.
He says this is an issue that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This once happened to me but since I didn't understand the language I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard news of the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He admits to having made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to make it into the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make it into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan and he then joined forces with Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan."
"I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who was hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would likely get further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has made an end to his dreams of making it big in Europe.
A woman found a snake in her neck.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black snake in the throat of a woman who had come there for treatment.
The doctors succeeded in pulling the worm out with tongs.
The investigation revealed that it was a predatory animal.
CNN is reporting on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of raw meat, a few days before.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but reptiles like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi gained popularity in the West, cases of people being infected by raw fish have increased according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in a state of emergency in relation to concerns of a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where authorities have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus anew.
In Catalonia, all nightlife has been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, while in Britain everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Cases are also increasing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and getting the economy back on track.
The situation in Europe is still good compared to other parts of the world, but the global rate of new infections is approaching 300 thousand per day, with the highest numbers in America and South Asia.
Confirmed cases have reached 16 million worldwide, according to the tally of Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Mosaic work finally gets to enjoy its full potential.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
Down below her are people with orange helmets.
There is also a big ditch.
And more minor machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the alleyway is narrow and now many people stand there and admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least not visible to the naked eye.
The project has been somewhat hidden up until now, right in front of it were parking lots that were always busy.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then left to attend to their business in the city center.
"Vibrant and diverse public spaces" and "inviting urban fabric" are guiding principles for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata which is now underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerðar Helgadóttur's mosaic work at the Tollhouse to be better appreciated.
In front of the work, there will be a plaza and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The artwork will be unveiled and now the material will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter floor.
The area will also feature small "mist fountains", some kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain atmosphere.
In this way, Reykjavik City Council is described as responsible for the implementation along with the Municipalities.
Water, heating and electricity supplies will be renewed.
Many of them are from their years, but the sewerage and cold water systems are from 1925 and have thus served the inhabitants and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after the works are completed, cars can drive on it again.
But she will still be unique and at the same time create calmer and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
In the knowledge base of the Customs House website, it is stated that the house was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor breeze passing through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall facing the street was formed.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a facade would have a negative effect on the overall appearance of the house, unless special measures were taken to enhance the look of the house.
The parties agreed to plan to install a permanent artwork there.
At this time, much was said of Gerða Helgadóttir, the artist, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and beyond.
It was advised to contact her first before deciding whether a competition for the job would be held.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect the life at the harbor, after all, the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was spoken to, she became overwhelmed with emotion at such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some suggestions for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, an overall agreement was desired with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long been working with them to set up famous artworks around Europe.
The agreements were successful and Gerður won the artwork under the setup of their brothers' workshop, who then took care of the setup of the Customs House.
The entire project was exceptionally well handled, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmann Brothers, according to the summary.
It has since endured the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move several establishments out of town
Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, announces that more public institutions will be moved out to the countryside in the near future.
This was said by the minister in the show Sprengisandi on Bylgjunni in the morning.
Recently it was announced that the Housing and Employment Agency's brownfield division will be relocated north to Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Six specialists in the field of fire safety work for the institution, but none of them intend to follow the institution north and the National Association of Firefighters and Paramedics has criticized the budget cuts in transportation.
"I think we should take further steps in this matter.
I am preparing further steps in this venture.
"Further shipments," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think further political decisions need to be taken about relocating public services to the countryside, like I did with the Housing and Welfare Agency," said Ásmundur, who also gave examples of other institutions that have been relocated to the countryside and made a big difference for the communities there, such as the relocation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Icelandic Land Survey to Akranes and unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
All the highlights from the last day of the Championship
The 94th Icelandic Championship in Freestyle Sports concluded at Thorsvell in Akureyri today.
Some records were set on the last competition day.
An exciting competition in women's shot put was expected at Thorswell, and Vigdis Jonsdottir from FH set an Icelandic record in shot put in 2014 which stood until Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in great form lately, having tripled the Icelandic Championship record since the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with an injury and was unable to make it to practice today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a new record at the same time.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July was 62.69 meters and she was thus somewhat away from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from Iceland had the second best throw of the day and she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH-ingurinn Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's representative in the hammer throw, won a convincing victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his second-to-last throw and set a record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Iceland's representative in discus throw, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvelli yesterday and today he competed in discus throw which is his main event.
Iceland's record holder Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters and he threw the longest at 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today with a valid throw of 49.43 meters, good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's representative in long jump, won the long jump competition with a remarkable performance as she jumped 6.25 meters today, which is just 40 cm short of her own Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 meter race, it was Icelandic runner Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, although her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday in the 100 meter sprint and the 4 x 100 meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Just like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
He won't be fined for a 27 million kroner Bitcoin-scam.
The appeals board has rejected the claim of the tax investigator who demanded a penalty against a person for underreporting his income derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator had not provided clear reasons why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax inspector found the man to have a valid case for incorrect tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had neglected to declare his income which had been generated from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or through gross negligence.
The court charged the man for his misconduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He managed to have sold cryptocurrencies for 27 million in 2016.
He had acquired her through grafting in 2009 and 2010 when such had been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implications of such a sale had been highly unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been impossible to expect ordinary taxpayers to be aware of such provisions in the tax return.
He had not expected to escape paying taxes on the income and had declared his assets on the declaration as deposits in a bank account.
He had asked both experts and the tax inspector how this should be handled but without success.
He then reckoned that he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started to mine for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to understand complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man deemed it right that his taxes for these two income years would be reassessed and a penalty imposed, but otherwise no punishment.
He reiterated that he had been living in Iceland and had been paying taxes in the country since 2012.
He never intended to evade his duties in an irresponsible manner.
The demand for damages would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur is making waves: "This man knows what football is about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been highly regarded by people and also has gained admiration for his success in playing with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max Division.
Sparks will fly in the ring tonight when they take on IA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is given a four-game suspension due to four warnings during the game and will therefore not be able to play with a new haircut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his shirt for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was rather better to try in the game.
He didn't go in disguise.
He wanted to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone to even out this game then I thought he would do it or make it happen," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max studio, when the talk turned to Brynjólfi.
"I'm here for the people."
"It is sometimes difficult to understand what position he is in.
He looks a bit to the left when the game is winding down, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson calls Brynjólf a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the team: "There is no doubt that this is character.
This is an interesting type and I love it with the hair, and always being ready to attend and answer in interviews.
There are an incredible amount of people taken in by him, which tells me that this man understands what football is.
"I am an entertainer.
I'm here for the people and to have a good time.”
People are reading Brynjolf's interviews, people are paying attention and watching what's next on his agenda.
"This man is just brilliant," said Máni.
Player KR said he wants to leave the team - "I have been in contact with some teams in the B Division."
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
"The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in an interview with Bold.
"I have been in contact with some teams in the B-division and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract at KR.”
He says he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
"Organizations in Denmark have likely felt more of the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland."
Bicycle messenger Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Now responds after discussion in DV
For the past few years, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He specializes in rescuing lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes, and scooters.
Has Bjartmar earned himself the nickname "the Bicycle Whisperer" for the week?
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a man revealed his dealings with Bjartmar.
DV pointed to discussions in the Westbæinga Facebook group where it was revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man at Austurvelli and said that the Vespa might be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original documents of the electrician other than that Bjartmar had robbed him.
The post has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original news article updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial reports of the incident do not accurately reflect what actually happened yesterday at Austurvelli.
Bjartmar claimed to have received information from the informant of the electricity theft that these were indeed their electricity meters.
The information was obtained by the alleged owner from another source, but the information proved to be wrong according to Bjartmar.
"I looked at the cow and I examined the scooter, and I had information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and had been searched for."
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off on the scooter I decided to pluck up the courage to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his case and so I decided to have a talk with the man.
Generally I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say the man had taken away my word.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the scooter offered him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted out."
So the owner of the laptop verified ownership of his laptop and left.
Later, the rightful owner of the laptop told his story on Facebook, as reported in the earlier news.
In this short year that Bjartmar has devoted to this craft, he claims to be able to count the differences he ended up making with people on the fingers of the other hand.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest people of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar and pointed out that bicycle thieves are usually the least brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"Debt is a harsh master and somehow one has to finance the next bit, unfortunately theft of such loose funds is an easy way to that end," says Bjartmar.
"My relationships with these people are so good that I have brought a lot of good people with me on the team.
There are examples of people going into treatment and taking responsibility and then coming to me for support in what I'm doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are on courteous terms.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle registration numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar states that the police are even directing people to talk to him due to the electric scooters.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the former news broadcast of DV and claims not to be any kind of self-appointed police in a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is still not on the high ice with his courage, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says so.
"Of course the law requires this, but the reality of the matter is that the law is simply not attending to this.
For example, I have seen police officers driving away from a large swarm of scooters.
She is downright clueless in these matters.”
"When the law is not doing anything about this, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can get results in this category, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved such success in keeping up with his skateboards that sometimes he outruns his "companions" on the street, that they just had to get the Bjartmari skateboards they had previously acquired.
The occasions that Bjartmar has called for police assistance have resulted in her simply not showing up.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bike owners' fault," said Bjartmar, and he finds it unfortunate that victims of bike theft have to suffer from the police's inaction in this category of cases.
There is no disagreement about Bjartmar's success.
Widely stories can be found of people thanking Bjartmari for having returned their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts naturally run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric cars, electric bikes, and electric scooters weigh heavily there, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a daycare during the week and works at a community center every weekend.
His bike ride is the unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a milestone year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received pensions from the Danish King all the way from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established which eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation for current pension funds of salaried employees was then laid with collective bargaining agreements in the labor market in 1969 where it was stipulated about occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were set based on these agreements and the pension system continued to grow after that.
Employee pension systems were not the only significant change that the labor movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle.
Unemployment benefits had been won in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also achieved some success in their demands for health care and pension rights, substantial vacation rights, reduction of working hours, housing allowances and other such matters of great importance.
All these rights cost a great and hard struggle, but proved, in the end, to be much more valuable and lasting improvement than the multiplication of wages in the wage scale, which disappeared as quickly in the inflation of the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The process of establishing public pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complicated.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would be in fact the property of the fund members, the labor movement insisted that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of the workforce in the fund's management was often discussed in the wage-earner's associations, but it never managed to pass, and so we are still stuck with the unnatural arrangement that representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority in the fund's management.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on Pension Security and Pension Fund Activity discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first article states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the fund members as its guiding principle."
Also stated in Article 5: "The pension fund shall set ethical criteria for investments."
The Investment Policy of the Merchants' Pension Fund includes, among other provisions, the following, in accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and asset managers in the West and Europe.
The regulations discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of bond portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society are reconciled in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, set out a public policy on: good corporate governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Pension Fund Gildi, one of the largest funds in the country, has set a "sustainable investment policy" and there are provisions of similar nature.
This is all summed up here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic buzzword, "shadow governance".
As the term is new to the language, it is not expected to have been defined to satisfaction, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most taken”: Shadow governance is when a leader of a corporate entity tells the media that they intend to send representatives of the company to the board of a pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how they should take a stance on a certain issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow management" after all, such interactions between people are always present in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to consider which path he finds "shadowier."
There are mainly two people who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on Saturday morning, July 25th, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the Newspaper, and Ásgeir Jónsson, a central bank governor.
The occasion for both was created after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his plan to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and pilots (fire them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Reykjavík Merchants' Association, sent out those recommendations to the association's representatives on the Board of the Merchants' Pension Fund to not support any potential purchase of the fund's shares in the company, or they might be made to step aside.
Shortly after, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and subsequently Ragnar Thor followed suit with his recommendation which was obviously based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw cause to elaborate on the matter in the Friday edition of the News with strong words about shadow governance, lawbreaking, and the urgent need for legal reform.
There was a small tuft that really had to turn a heavy load though the blessed tuft had been in a state of connection and in addition had been dried out quickly.
As the matter is important, let us attend to the subject itself in the end.
I previously mentioned here the provisions in the pension fund laws that relate to this matter.
This entails that fund managers must take into account the interests of fund members and have ethical considerations in investments, and these points are elaborated further in the regulations of both the Association of Icelandic Banks and the Pension Fund of Retailers, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT only look to short-term profit objectives in their investments.
Such would be a highly risky policy and one need not look far for examples of such in the past, where large loans to banks and funds have been given to unscrupulous speculators and environmental polluters, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on a high when it occurred to him to lay off a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw sense and drew back from it.
Time will tell whether the investment of pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members when it is set up.

One of the infected did not have a travel history.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from the Baltic States on July 15th last week, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not resident here by statute and therefore did not receive clear instructions to take the so-called homecoming test after arriving in the country and to take another test a few days after arrival.
He got a negative result from the border inspection.
"But he is in the Icelandic society and should have gone through that process," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of health care at the National Health Service and the acting health care doctor while he is on summer break, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no requirement to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second show."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad, but due to his connection to the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic one instead.
He had not realized this.
"When the ID number is not registered, you need to take the initiative to get the late exam."
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to enhance the information dissemination about this while we find some way to make an automated booking system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are the participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question is treated as a participant in Icelandic society, a current Icelander, despite their arrival in the country.
Only six have been put in quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are due for a check-up but two of them have already shown symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got a negative result from his border crossing on July 15th.
Camilla says it is likely that he has recently been infected with the virus as it had not yet been able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to exclude the possibility that the man was infected here in Iceland and not brought the virus with him to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to assert that this is definitely an imported infection since it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused some commotion in relation to the sports event."
She says it is very unlikely though due to how few people he interacts with here.
"It is actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but she points out that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic testing has been able to sequence the virus in the person.
"If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has brought it into the country."
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters
A clash between police and protesters occurred in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and non-lethal stun guns against the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and gender discrimination were widely protested in the United States yesterday evening, with the protests in Seattle in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
Thousands gathered in Seattle for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to the construction site and broke windows at the city courthouse.
Subsequently, the police declared the protests to be unruly and clashes ensued between the groups of protesters and the police.
Demanding justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police last August, was remembered by protesters.
The car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed by police in her home in March last year.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation to closed intersections where police held back a group of people protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
Seventy-five people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our era
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, then Solskjær and his team will end up in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
They still have hope of making it to the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We are not at the end yet.
"If we get points against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad period," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to do to catch up with the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that the teams will be ready at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it was any other game.
"If you want to be part of Manchester United then you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the society is built on this.
We have been presented with a great opportunity to end the season on a high and now it is up to us to take it," said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments that define this period.”
"Bruno Fernandes coming in changed a lot for us and I think overall we are in better shape and stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjaer.
65,000 infections per annum
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
In total, 4,178,021 cases of infection have been confirmed in the West since the beginning of the pandemic there.
900 died due to the virus yesterday, and in the last four days the death toll due to the virus has been more than 1,000 worldwide.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, according to the US health authorities' forecast, the number of deaths from the virus will be 175,000 by August 15th.
Fear the next wave of the pandemic.
The authorities in Spain are now trying with weak measures to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more cases have been reported in one solar cycle since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish start to ease one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now requiring passengers coming from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain where the authorities have taken to more extensive restrictions in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand inhabitants in the Segria region in western Catalonia.
It is said that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is still suffering from the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in Britain, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in reimposing a wide-ranging lockdown that has widely disrupted the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, has taken a very dim view of such and likened it to nuclear weapons which he would not use.
Then, Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide lockdown were to be imposed again.
Many advisors hope that local measures that target individual towns, cities, or areas will be enough to contain the virus if it returns in the next round.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday in addition to two more at the border.
Five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In the public safety announcement, it is stated that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
Has he been quarantined and sixteen who were in close contact with him in the sickbay?
The infected person was a participant in a social activity of a sports club in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, "only a part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine are connected to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and the spread of the infection is currently being investigated by the National Police Commissioner's infection control team.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the health and safety authorities that are still in effect and appropriate measures have been taken.
Pictures of the match yesterday drew attention as it could be seen very closely celebrating the good performance of their team on the field.
At 11 o'clock today, the organizers released the following announcement on their Facebook page.
NOTICE: Parents kindly respect the rules that competitors must pick up their own kit at the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for the shown understanding.
Another infection was identified yesterday which is related to the infection reported from the day before.
The announcement states: "Icelandic genetic testing has identified the infection and revealed a new strain of virus that has not been identified here before."
Work is being done on the contagion as well and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in the sickroom.
Two of them have already started showing symptoms of virus infection.
Additionally, two border crossings were identified and further investigation results are awaited, as the protocols for border crossings dictate.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Health Department of the National Police and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to be vigilant and take individual preventive measures against infection.
Playing it safe to determine if any symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same request to go for a test at the nearest health facility.
Patreksfjörður announces the camping site booked up for the merchants' weekend - Directs guests elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjordur is fully booked for the weekend, according to the announcement of Vesturbyggd.
Guests are encouraged to explore other lodging options.
West Coast Villages Bildudal, Talknafjord, Melanes at Red Sand, Hotel Flokalund and Hotel Breidavik are mentioned as other options in the area.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjordur this weekend, as like previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the turnout at the campsite, we can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't put a damper on things, but DV reported an optimistic forecast earlier today.
We can expect the worst weather from the south, and hope for the best for the Patreksfirðinga.
The website bb.is reported first, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment complex is crumbling down at the best spot in the city.
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are waiting for building permits for renovations, their applications have been backlogged in the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik stands a stately three-story townhouse.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases each containing four quite spacious apartments.
Are they in the range of 93-130 square meters, though most over 100.
The house has a considerable history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store of the Milk Society, a Joa tailor, a fish store, and most recently, the University Press.
The house, so to speak, has remembered its former beauty.
The house is now under considerable damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 Ltd.
The owners of D18 Ltd. are, among others, Magnus Magnusson and Gudrun Helga Larussdottir, according to the company register.
Magnus represented the shareholders of Borgun and was the defender of the holding company Borgun.
Among the shareholders of the holding company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also an owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once owned the Stálskip company.
D18 Ltd. purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and has since then done little to nothing to maintain it.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has been deteriorating steadily since, especially in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood residents, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
It can be inferred that the owners have been trying to change the house and the lot for a few years.
Other neighbors say the house has been in disrepair for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something about this mess and it is unfortunate that it has dragged on for so long."
He also says that he is out of the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and end this "legal mess".
"Do this in consultation with the community around so that it can be driven in and completed."
The "legal gap" referred to is the court's procedural process which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build an additional floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator building and an extension of one floor plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for the project was appealed to the Environmental and Property Rights Tribunal and the Tribunal invalidated it as the project did not have a basis in zoning regulations and the boundary survey was not sufficient.
Reykjavik City then started a dispute resolution process and concluded it with an announcement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That arrangement was also challenged and the board invalidated it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for building permit and the owners of the house at the starting point.
The house had deteriorated significantly by this time and the neighbors had begun to tire.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reactions of the neighbors were varied.
Some had an understanding of the owner's plans, others not at all.
Some directed their anger towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily out for anyone.
Others said the parking lot was congested, but neighbors have used the unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One complainant in the case claimed to be exhausted by the bureaucracy:
"It is completely unbelievable that we have to go through the process in three stages."
It's like Reykjavik City doesn't know how to read.
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the civic administration of the city and the generous plans of the owner and many years of their work now at the starting point.
When the journalist approached the gate of Dunhaga 18, galloping doors and a rumbling roar greeted him.
A Playstation console and a recent television were among the debris on the ground — remnants of an Icelandic summer cottage.
The old office of the University Press was opened and there were quite a few cats of the local breed to judge.
It is clear that someone has backed themselves into a corner but no visible way out.
Stacks of sofas and rooms and a few piles of geology papers, which probably should have been a book, greeted us.
The staircases of the apartment building were likewise open and alive in both.
The journalist was so lucky to run into one of the inhabitants.
There were Romanians cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employment agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time and sources from DV claim that the company has not paid for the accommodation except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not defensible to collect rent.
Judging by the postmarks on the door of the house, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The labor leasing industry has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most active in utilizing labor leasing services.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work aprons and overalls hung in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the deplorable condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be well maintained.
When the journalist greeted the Romanian boys, the coldness was suddenly clear to him: At the best location in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square meter property downgraded.
The owners want to renovate the house for improvement and the neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree on the definition of "improvement".
Between them sits the city's administrative department at the starting point, an endless path of sacrifice and complaint options in the administrative process and the resolution of the Environmental and Property Rights Board.
In the house live Romanian workers, maybe even those who will take over when the Icelanders stop rioting.
The article was originally published in the Sunday newspaper DV on July 17th.
In an effort to combat obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on junk food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, where doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patients with obesity and will also be advised to take action to increase the number of bike lanes.
Advertising of fast-foods on television will be banned after 9 pm, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Minister is determined to use this time to become healthier, more active and to eat healthier food," said a government spokesperson.
Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, but he was admitted to the hospital when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is considered to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater democracy, efficiency, and working against corruption and for the benefit of the whole.
"We need to start changing gears a bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that has an easier time being in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are renowned for their feminism.
Standing together and being together to bring about change.
So now it's up to us to lead these changes.”
She said she was somewhat uncomfortable with the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not equally prepared to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look into everything that needs to be done.
It is a slope.
We need to know where we come from, understand the story, and listen.
Listen to the advice of experienced groups.
"We don't all abide by the same rules here," said Helga.
She said women are in a good position in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders still adhere to very male-dominated values.
She said that politics tended to be about self-interest, power and control which were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and are just a bit frustrated that the Parliament seems to be dragging its feet on this referendum from 2012," she said.
"It is these feminine values that we are thinking this out from.
"In terms of human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the core values in the new constitution.
"We are a very wealthy country of natural resources and it is deplorable that there are people living in poverty here."
"It's impossible, we can change it differently," said Helga.
It is outrageous that there is a natural law that women's work is always paid less.
It is unacceptable that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for fair wages.
It is possible to sign the petition for the new constitution here through e-Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he assaulted a pedestrian and attempted to take money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Arbae where two were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðunum where the driver was going at 146 km/h where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
Additionally, he had previously been stripped of his driving privileges.
The police force in the capital region had plenty to keep them busy last night and around 80 cases were recorded in the police log from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of buzz about compliance announcements.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven loud disturbances were received and it was considered a lot in the police log.
However, 22 charges were laid against the police last night.
Six were detained in the jail cell last night.
The police were called to the scene in the night when suspects fired fireworks into the sky.
They were, however, ready to defend themselves when the police officer approached the gate.
Nine drivers were stopped for drunk driving and/or drug-related offenses.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night and one of them was detained in a jail cell.
Two were rushed to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West End.
One was taken to the emergency room after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a cyclist who was riding a bike on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle of the cyclist's helmet, according to the police report, was in "very poor condition" and it was confiscated.
It is possible to stay in Monet's house during the weekend of the merchants.
The house that Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are around the merchants' holiday.
The house is small and quaint, located in the village of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, he must rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, it is next available after a week, on Sunday of the merchants' holiday, and so it could be suitable for someone on vacation to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the merchants' weekend cost only 964 US dollars or around 130 thousand Icelandic kronur according to Fréttablaðið.
Dozens of people have been quarantined and some of them have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Hundreds have been quarantined due to this and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the virus it causes.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at the border crossing.
An expert from the Department of Health says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
"It has been traced back to the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community at any time.
This is probably something new to the country but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the disease control department of the National Board of Health.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests are being conducted in the near future and some who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"There is no flu season now and fewer other respiratory illnesses, so we can be somewhat liberal with doing this test on individuals who during flu season would have had reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
The outbreak is mostly over but it is not ruled out that more people may need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
Has it raised questions as to whether it is defensible to hold such an event.
The public safety manager says it is perfectly fine as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Camilla says it is almost certain that the infected ones did not get infected at the sports events.
"If no more people go into isolation from those who have interacted with them at these sports events, then we can assume that our preventive measures at the events have worked.
"But that's not come to light," said Kamilla.
The work of the public defense department is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary," said Kamilla.
After a week, it is expected that the crowd limits will be lifted up to a thousand people.
This new position could have an impact on allowances.
"A Certain Reflection on Cooking" - See Elisa Vidar's Menu
Elisa Vidarsdottir is a soccer player and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for her daily tasks and usually takes time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
"My typical day starts with me arriving to work at eight o'clock," says Elisa.
"After work I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock."
Elisa finds it very rewarding to pick up her daughter from preschool early.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice later on."
After exercising it is good to come home and just heat up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good to watch one episode to clear our minds.
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what she should eat to have enough energy to work, study, take care of her family and exercise.
"What works for me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorize food as bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
It is perfectly alright to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.
Elisa has a great interest in firefighting.
"I find a certain contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking and take a lot of pleasure in it.
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a great cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let soak in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available each time.
Usually it's banana and some muesli & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee lover.
Snack: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, cookies, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with slices out of the box if that works.
Lunch: I often make a variety of salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, lettuce salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is usually what I'm working with.
When the schedule goes completely off the rails (which happens often) then the egg machine in the office has saved me quite a few times and then it's two slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, don't put any more on you.
Snack: Get me something carb-rich for workouts, bread with toppings, muesli or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
Authorities in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of emergency following mass protests in the downtown area.
Yesterday, the police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had occupied and stretched across several blocks near the city's parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism done to the police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosive.
Police and law enforcement authorities say protesters have pelted police with stones, bottles, firecrackers, and other loose objects and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were assessed.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was to show solidarity to the protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been an ongoing conflict between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people are gathering under the banners of Black Lives Matter, commemorating George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding reforms.
Not to be revoked until after a vote
It is still not clear whether the layoffs of Icelandair employees, which are due to take effect in the next month, will be reversed.
The online voting on the collective agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association on behalf of the flight attendants of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
"This clearly ties together," says Guðlaug Líney.
"No layoffs have been reversed, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
So people are obviously anxious to find out if they will have a job after the month ends.”
An agreement was signed last week, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the pilots had previously voted on.
On July 17th, the board and council of Icelandair Flight Union approved to declare a general strike, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants Union, terminate all of its flight attendants, and seek agreements with another union.
The airline's pilots were then required to take on the role of security officers on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is hard to say.
"People are in shock after this announcement from Icelandair, when all of the airline's flight attendants were laid off and informed that an agreement would be made with another union.
"Now it becomes clear whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period is misaligned, for those with the shortest tenure it is three months and ends around the July-August month end.
In that group, there are about 90% of Icelandair passengers.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
"We look forward to continuing our dialogue with our stakeholders.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airline has gone too far.”
The vote on the collective agreement ends and Icelandair will announce the results of the first quarter tomorrow.
The flight attendants' vote on the new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be released tomorrow, but the preliminary results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The online voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association and the Icelandic Confederation of Labor regarding Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27th at 12 noon.
Those who are eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Union.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on Sunday night, July 19th, after Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the union the Friday before, after flight attendants had rejected the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had previously informed all of its flight attendants and pilots to be on duty on Friday, but they were called back after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until the year 2025 and it has incorporated provisions for pilots and flight attendants regarding how long one shift can fly.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and many flight attendants whom the press spoke to expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most seemed to agree that the agreement should be approved to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, with the company's EBIT, operating income for financial items and taxes, according to preliminary results, estimated to be negative between 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent Kauphöllin an urgent invoice last Wednesday, saying that the company's revenue had decreased by 60 million dollars, or about 8.3 billion krona.
Portable money and its equivalent had been around 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer shares of the company in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete agreements with fifteen financiers, governments and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before going into a debt offering.
A new variant rather than a new species of virus
"A new wave just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
"This is not something that has been seen domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, Chief Physician at the Infectious Diseases Department of Landspítalinn, about the news that a "new strain of virus" has been identified in the country.
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday and two at the border.
One who tested positive had participated in a social activity of a sports club at the Rey Cup football match, but the source of the infection is unknown and the infection tracing is still ongoing.
Additionally, an infection was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15th and two people who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, an infection was identified related to the infection reported the day before and after Icelandic genetic testing, it was revealed that "a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
Containment is completed in relation to that infection.
Mar points out that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about another wave of migration, Már says that as it stands it is a single case and it could be that nothing more comes of it.
"However, if there are cases within the country that are not related to overseas and have the same genetic makeup as this particular variant, then it would be possible to make that conclusion [about the second wave], but it is too early to do so," Mar explains.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot pots?
BBC documentary makers lead to a humorous video that sheds light on the country's sunbathing and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is said that nowhere else in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
Natural geothermal energy is the basis of this, as well as the tradition of insulation that prevails here.
Compulsory education of children was legislated in 1940, but older citizens are no less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Public transportation is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free from cell phones, people connect on a personal level at home and abroad or take advantage of the similar power of water: thoughts and emotions recharge souls and bodies.
It's only a hundred days to the elections.
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election but he has an uphill battle to fight.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic nominee, has a large lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a recent poll by AP news agency, a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the global spread of the new coronavirus is similarly very unpopular and furthermore, more Americans than ever before believe that the president has handled economic matters poorly.
Specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has done well on economic matters.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden has 49.9 percent nationwide support while Trump has 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift the focus away from his stance on immigration to Biden, emphasize so-called culture wars, and promote policies that are supposed to adhere to laws and regulations.
Biden's offer however puts a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and counts great chances of winning if the election really comes down to how Trump has performed in office in the last four years.
Unpopular Trump also seems to be targeting Republican lawmakers and Democrats fear they could even gain a majority in the House of Representatives, which until now has seemed highly unlikely.
Politico reported today that party and candidate loyalty is waning and that the Republican Party is now facing its biggest losses in a decade.
The suburbs have proven to be particularly unfavorable in the 2016 elections and now there is a prospect that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, among other things, by saying that if Biden is president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and exacerbate gender divisions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then encouraged "housewives" from the United States to read an article by the former New York Deputy Secretary, in which she argued that Biden would eliminate US housewives and Trump endorsed it.
"Biden will restore your neighborhoods and the American Dream.
"I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the president.
Residents of the outer suburbs of the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become the president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 elections, his support there has significantly dwindled.
Although it varies between polls, Biden has spoken with about a fifteen percent lead over Trump in the polls recently.
Regis Philbin has passed away.
American television personality Regis Philbin has passed away, aged 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, presenter, and singer for about six decades.
He is most famously known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the individual who has spent the most hours on American television and has been recognized for this achievement.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
It is stated in a statement from his family that Philbin has died of natural causes.
A number of collaborators, friends and admirers have celebrated him on social media last year.
Will the Olympic Flame be lit at the end of the race?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through together.
The crew has an extra year to prepare themselves and the authorities in Japan are covering the costs due to the delay.
Everyone holds their breath, after all, much is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates were overwhelmed with joy.
They wept and cheered alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games but had to settle for a lower-key event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan should both draw the world's attention.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year and will now start on July 23rd 2021 and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to keep the game going, if the coronavirus threat is still too great, the game will be stopped.
Nobody really wants to think that thought to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular and strive to top the last performance.
The selection of a host city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more impressive the presentation is, the more likely you are to get the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in trying to host the 2016 Olympics, which is roughly 20 billion kroner.
The second time, when the 2020 games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion kroner, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was chosen to host the games that year, Japanese authorities had already allocated a budget of 30 billion yen for the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to host such an event, prepare for it and hold the games themselves.
Planners in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway this days but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the state auditor in Japan released at the end of last year, it was still noted that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It is likely not possible to put an exact figure on the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could thus run between 15 to 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic state taxes would only cover about half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion among economists, who try to delve into the numbers and examine the gains and losses of the Games.
In the shortest terms, it appears that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are any, for example, a large increase in jobs for a short period of time, but in the long run, cities often remain with debt and high operational costs of little used manpower.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is still dealing with significant debts from the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to maintain all the major sports facilities that were built for the games.
Figures have been examined after the London 2012 games and it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting Olympic Games due to the exorbitant costs associated with the infrastructure built for the games.
The benefit is still often thought to be found in increased tourist traffic wanting to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is much uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main point is still the honor that citizens are granted to be elected, but it is difficult to quantify in terms of money.
Despite the tremendous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring cannot be put a price on.
Although the show is often extravagant and nowhere to be saved, this is obviously not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some adventurers, it's surprisingly welcome to postpone the games.
Australian pentathlete and gold medalist at the 2016 Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, is a casuarina and would have been far from good form this summer but is hopeful of being in competition shape for the 2021 Games.
She is one of those athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to retire after the games this year, had they been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will retire before the games take place.
Do not trust your body simply to go through a year of intense workouts.
Few athletes came as close to capturing the hearts of the spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to compete in 2021 but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the game next year, as she will be 24 then.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a gymnast in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but she still moves on to another in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she intends to achieve the same success at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year of extra training," says Biles.
She has previously mentioned that her body cannot handle the strain that comes with gymnastics training for very long.
Nevertheless, she is training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles acknowledges that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
No exceptions were made for Biles compared to other athletes while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic golds couldn't buy her any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like the rest.
The basic form certainly surpasses that of most people.
"We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start exercising again after the gym reopened.
We started slow but are now in full swing and I will increase the exercises as the year progresses.
We obviously don't know exactly how these games will turn out or if they will be held, but we are still aiming for them to be held, can't do anything else.
"I have put too much into the sport to quit now," says Biles.
With her, like many others, there is a doubt or maybe rather an awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021.
Predicting it is however hopeless.
No one can know what the situation of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympics assuming they will be held next year.
Maybe the Olympic Flame will be the light at the end of the Covid-tunnels.
Postponed the wedding due to the pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are more important things to think about right now," said the actor in an interview with People.
"We definitely want to get married sometime and have that dream wedding and have all the people close to us there.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what is important right now and that is to help spread the message of the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more into world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what is happening in the world.”
