From my perspective, the literature program was shaped by Balzac-era women based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
The psychology and suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, that was very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such coloring and petal structure, resembling velvet, usually of dark red or burgundy tones.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
The Prestige Micro-Package Model: Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex slab.
The 1000-spring block per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally well-ventilated, as is coir coconut.
This helps maintain a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The manufacturer's official warranty period is 5 years, but the mattress's actual service life is longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable jacquard cover supplied with the product.
Get an orthopedic pillow to go with the mattress – it is recommended to support the optimal position of the spine while sleeping.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrei, it has been clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not be working in a team line.
The computer teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught that, the school kids are playing Windows games.
So there is no support.
I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the door and cutlets still sizzling on the stove, Mom in a flurry mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
Then mop the floor and clean the house.
You shop for groceries a week before the holiday, cook for two days, and clean up the day after.
And the guests?
They are doing well, and they must bring a cake with them.
Ever since then, I don't like holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
I make them treats and bake them something just for fun.
Germany: Fourth Vaccination Against Coronavirus is Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
Ulrich Weigel, the head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be needed by summer at the latest, fall at the latest," says the expert.
Furthermore, Wiegel hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be done "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron".
Moreover, the new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
BioNTech and Pfizer's research showed that two doses of the vaccine had significantly lower efficacy: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25-fold".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are pushing for faster vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the Chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, according to Zalzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omega-variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling in this regard," the expert underscored.
Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib 54 Silent 54mm 8.5g lure.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for bottom fishing, not just for casting.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top bezel made of strong and flexible plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when swiping vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter bait" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is a simple monotonous one, i.e. a back-and-forth movement of the pendulum with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags, and other obstacles that can snag.
Additionally, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for winter sea bass and large flounder, and especially in mid-winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To meet her demands, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib can tease a passive pike that does not even react to bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib shows its range and accuracy.
This lure is easy to understand and not capricious, and it goes well with both monofilament and braided lines of even large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or roach, in addition to uniform trolling, the "step" method, sometimes with "tapping" the bottom, is also applicable.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch the front treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective lures.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12th, by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
"They have 30 fighter jets at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt)," Anadolu agency quoted him as saying.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are trying to seize the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence.
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency noted.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving Kremlin support.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to exploit minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to media reports, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in either the military or the corporate registry, and its fighters are not included in the formal personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We recall that the 27 EU ambassadors previously approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
The Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, according to Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% think that failures predominate.
Examples of successes include "protecting and restoring peace in Syria", "the resolution of the Nord Stream 2 issue", "scaring the world with cool weapons", and "taking back Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are mentioned in the research of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have become digital only.
The Dubai government announced its full commitment to paperless operations and the adoption of digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirates News Agency WAM.
"Today marks the start of a new era of digital transformation across all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, all Dubai government entities will only conduct internal and external document circulation digitally through specialized information platforms.
The reform touched upon all sectors without exception: health care, utilities, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities calculated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
That's ridiculous, asking for birth dates and how old the child is, and also asking for the class and group in kindergarten.
I can't believe such shenanigans happen.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including family.
My mother, her two brothers, and her grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaya Street, in a ground floor apartment without bars.
They knocked on the door first, then the window, then decided not to be polite and broke the window and got in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat and they got it.
These people knew for sure that someone was at home...
Turkey's car production and exports have dropped below the 2020 level.
Turkey's car production and exports sharply declined in November amid a devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November Turkey produced 115,000 cars, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75,900 machines were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11th month of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which depreciated by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
Over 500 MSB entities received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhon Smailov spoke about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium businesses, according to the correspondent of Kazinform.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 dated April 9, 2021 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Payment Deferrals on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses", - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the deferral of loan payments provided for the granting of payment deferrals on loans issued to MSB customers, including sole proprietors, by banks and microfinance organizations before April 1, 2021, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period was from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's statement could specify an alternative deferment period for payments.
"During the grace period, the creditor was prohibited from taking any legal action, sending notices of default, or collecting any fees or other payments," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, applications for loan payment deferment were received from 603 borrowers-SMEs to second-tier banks, of which 553 SMEs received deferment for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
"The MFI has received applications for deferral from 131 SME subjects, of which 95 subjects have been granted deferral for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the "okmirone" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation, he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, it became very rapid.
"It seems that he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe than he should have, their antibodies were not cut during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmiron" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is often the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while the elderly in their 60s just shrug it off.
Sergei Puryasev concluded that the young man's immune response was completely inappropriate: where he could only threaten with his finger, he was shooting like a gun at sparrows.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope lies with the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of organism intoxication - this includes fever, weakness, and malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the younger generation aged 12 to 18 may start to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from the coronavirus.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, like kindergarteners, - Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, told Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I fondly reminisced...
Sit-in.
In the distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was complete without the tunes of this group.
At home, they would gather with friends and dance to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who had died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune response.
SARS-CoV-2 is likely capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Semen Goloshekin, a candidate of biological sciences, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar setting.
Golsheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and deficiencies of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep deprivation, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of disease, the WHO recommends maintaining an adequate level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Cognitive Disorders Department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, and Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV channel by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to repatriate 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year, 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Goud clarified that all artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
The department staff are now working on their repatriation to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and sales online" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural artifacts are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the artifacts returned was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held an auction in which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, had been kept in a private collection and not put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of illegally exported antiquities from the country in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people is composed of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse Wants Access to Employees' Personal Mobile Devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have shifted to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse is not officially commenting on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is independent, yet well-known and in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegova" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
The crowning success was the signing of a contract between Gosizdat and Esenin in late June of that year for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern-day poet has been honored like Sergei Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - the contract stipulated 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya Tolstaya, and he had to set up a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed that life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly dark, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Over the empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September
Alcohol is brain-numbing.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had aged badly, looked ill, and was obviously unwell.
There are more and more episodes of lassitude and nervous breakdowns.
And the cause is likely not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Aleksandrovich, no reliable documents remain.
For instance, in May 1923, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Ayseda Duncon, Esenin was recuperating in a clinic near Paris under the care of Professor Petrus Gannushkin (he would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
There is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this matter, and calls to the police scattered in dozens of memoirs.
From the early twenties, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed briefly with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his relatively good income, Esenin never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg, instead renting apartments, staying in hotels, or staying with friends.
Grandpa reminisces:
He would come only to sleep and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, splattering the sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (where Prohibition was in effect, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm near the end and I stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because the longing gnawed at me.

Now his son is almost 16 and he no longer has any desire to smoke.
All his energy is directed towards choosing what he will make a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband was before we got married, who had occasional run-ins with the law.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely".
Why did the girl cry on the exam even though she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
She will have a tail.
So what?
It will be retaken.
Millions of students know this.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
Poland's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement by the Deputy Foreign Minister was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new paths".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many points of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Señor's Hat": When a Velvet Jacket Makes a Man a Laughing Stock
Velvet blazers were the dominant fashion at 2021 social events.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashionable solution was Daniel Craig.
At the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die" in September, he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, which was not in line with the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was adopted by Lionel Messi.
The footballer arrived to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analytics service reported to Gazeta.Ru, their products were being bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors being dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
This season, the luxury velvet blazer segment is represented in almost all brands - from Brioni to Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, which was worn by brand ambassador Jared Leto at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
When choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not the model or cut, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It's also suitable for occasions when the dress code is 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie'."
Another important criterion that allows one to choose a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket should, first and foremost, have the right advanced company with enough money," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel." - Owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with arrows, monotone shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from those who organize the event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If the employee is of a lower rank and his goal is to move up the complex hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so forced and drawn out.
And not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of the people around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy sources are also not in demand - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
Every little bit helps.
Who's left in the lurch then?
Just a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, it is not fair to label Western politicians as idiots for "missing" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good cause.
I didn't see any attractive people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they won't be sitting next to them, most likely.
But only due to mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slavery and fights against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who does not know his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he voluntarily extols the virtues of slavery and praises a kind and good master is a lackey, a sycophant.
The immunologist stated that vaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of coronavirus.
Vaccination four to five months later can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection, "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the six-month vaccination, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Under the old strains, that timeline was normal, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - in four," said the expert, calling for a parallel vaccination campaign to be launched for revaccination.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If someone has had two doses and a booster, or they have been infected and vaccinated, or vaccinated and then infected, then they have a 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The G7 warned Russia of "significant consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The "Group of Seven" (Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement reads.
The ministers then called on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments to transparency in military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also declared.
The use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and a serious price to pay in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation for our collective and comprehensive response," the statement also reads.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "the unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and made it very clear that any invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the Omikron strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omega-strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other forms of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the Omikron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
Scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease progression when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omikron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
Ukraine's Minister of Defense, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its stance on bayonets, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the countries in question are the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to him, the previous German government had explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping its navy.
Ukraine expects Germany to be a "technical partner" to the country, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes lodged a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The German team Mercedes, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, has lodged a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team is challenging the decision of the referees to send the rounders back to one round with the leaders.
According to the second - Vettel overtook Hamilton to the allowed "restart" zone.
We should add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, in which Vettel beat Hamilton by 2,256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is provisional until Mercedes' protests are considered.

The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the buildup of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement published on the UK government website said.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it invades Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We made it clear that any invasion would have serious consequences...
"The G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
At the G7 Foreign Ministers' Summit in Liverpool, the ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border, the parties must return to the negotiating table.

Ways to recover stolen money from online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to get money stolen from online stores back and to not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Their findings were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses if the bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when shopping at stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, a refund process can be initiated.
"Under the rules set by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement with the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Furthermore, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores will refund the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, Public Chamber member and Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021 there were 11 thousand appeals on various cases of fraud, from selling fake documents to stealing personal data.
She said that an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Belarus border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be calling on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravcsek, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin declared that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the causes of disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland for finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violated EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on any public obligations to stop the "Nord Stream 2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional staffer said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G7.
Dmitry, look more carefully.

I know these apartments very well and can see how it was re-planned beautifully.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when they write about ways to clean the sink, toilet, windowsills, and faucets.
Do you wash them once a year on Easter or something that you have to scrub off?
Just don't get dirty.

The draft decree stipulates that the Fund shall be established "for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".

Doctors warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of anticoagulants after COVID-19 infection and before coronavirus vaccination.
Dr. Irina Yartseva, a therapist and immunologist, said that self-prevention of possible thrombus formation after COVID-19 could trigger a stroke.

According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and starting to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, of their own volition, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And upon preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors observe bruising.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be rewarded.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches a message of prosperity and abundance for the devout Christian.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cole was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He donated the find to the church and, according to him, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the find is related to the theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of twenty-five thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim the amount as the reward had already expired.
Nevertheless, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received a donation of twenty thousand dollars from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive twenty thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her utterances, her actions - this is her characterization as a "real person".

In Brazil, citizens are required to present a vaccination passport upon entry into the country.
In Brazil, it was mandated to require a COVID-19 passport from those entering the country's territory, a decision made by Luis Roberto Barroso, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempted from presenting a vaccination certificate.
People arriving from countries where no vaccine is available are also exempt from the list.
"The situation is even more serious when we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival, and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barrozo noted.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities had mandated that non-immune tourists from coronavirus infection observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein revealed the full protection scheme from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved through the injection and application of a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
Inside, after vaccination, we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
"If you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The Chief Epidemiologist of the UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that case, as the organism's protection should presumably become maximal.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that this is the same picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Hmmm...Inna.
I used to talk to my dog (who has long since passed away) like this - if you're willing to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet nose, then go ahead.
But the sparrow was trained and generally smart.
I chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
Believe me, it's not just talk.
I held back many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200,000 were running away (pomskies), I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, the "200,000" chose a master, not a dog running around somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination are continuing in Europe.
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and government plans to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
Starting from February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held up signs that said "This is a false pandemic", "I won't get vaccinated".
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid-certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce health passports by the authorities of several regions of the country was taken in the face of an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The demonstration started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with the police.
The group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement personnel used water cannons.
There is no consensus on this matter even in Wikipedia, according to Nikolai S.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans bring only death and pillage to any country they set foot in.

WHO has already detected the "omicron" in over sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus, "Omikron," has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was reported in a WHO statement.
According to the organization, by December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite it only becoming actively spread from the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception in terms of spread.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had stated that the Omikron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The same conclusions were reached in the United Kingdom as well.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "Omicron" variant will displace the "Delta" variant in the coming months.
The number of those infected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people in the Kingdom currently suffering from "micronom" and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is further complicated by recent studies showing that the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than against other strains.
It is still unknown how the Russian satellite V will react to the "Omikron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.
Why do we need to see stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE more closely the execution of your exercises.

Hands on the hips?
Curious Bunny, you are right, communication online is quite different, it is easy and casual, while in person there is nothing to say.
And seeing the person in person, maybe it wasn't what you expected, it didn't click - hence the attitude.
When one meets their match, then opinions will change.
Again, the Soviet era is referred to as the "time of the bez."
Back then, people believed in God much more sincerely than today.
And we were raised practically according to God's laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
The ideology today is money at any cost.
Globby-types have little faith (if any at all), but even if so, the time of the demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg (or rather Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
We are certainly not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Perhaps this was due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was still in effect.
Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing each other more and more at funerals.
Lara, stop it!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, squirming, pushing, fighting, and wrestling, just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
Too bad they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but no bumper cars!
And for what?
Did Brother push without calculating the strength?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of floods.
At least seven people were killed and 175 injured as a result of heavy rains that fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and its neighboring Minas Gerais.
TASS reports this with reference to the rescue services.
A non-tropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states since mid-week, resulting in a rainfall level of 450 mm in the region. A state of emergency has been declared in 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia, with some of them experiencing the most destructive floods in 35 years.
Several bridges, two river dams, and three tracks have been destroyed by the elements.
According to the rescuers, around 5,700 people were left homeless and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected more than 85,000 people in the region.

$135 billion went into Hi-Tech applications.
In 2021, user spending in apps worldwide grew by 25%, while downloads increased by 8%.
Video services of various kinds became the most popular in the world.
The most downloaded video editor was CapCut, and the most spent was on YouTube.
The number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant growth from January to November 2021.
Downloads increased by 8%, reaching 1.4 billion. User spending in apps grew even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was released by analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to physical' slow down the growth of app economy? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India became the leader in app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
Following them are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS gadget users, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
The video editor CapCut was the most downloaded app in 2021.
Following it are two Indian apps: the video service MX TakaTak and the online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, among users popular VPN services (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are in the top 10) are popular.
"Users spent the most in apps for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report noted.
YouTube leads here, with video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma also in the top 5 for user spending.
The top five monthly active users are Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in terms of downloads for the year.
Following it are the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same old CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: the online karaoke StarMaker, the online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the online taxi ordering service DiDi, the YouTube client Pure Tuber, the retailer "Dixy" app, and the online store "Samokat".
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be seen as one of the main takeaways.
"The industries that helped people to be closer, both virtually and personally, achieved the most success," commented Lexi Sidow, head of the App Annie marketing research department, on the report's results.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. Casual and hyper-casual games, with little or no story and minimal video presentation, were the leaders in downloads.
The top 3 most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
App Annie previously released its forecast for 2022.
Among the major trends for next year, the company's analysts named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, such as the Robinhood investor app, and the continued rise in popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new scam scheme.
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director, Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
This allows the neural network to accurately reproduce the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the purpose of extortion.
"Such forgeries can easily lead to bullying, as a malicious hacker can put people in awkward, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Varonis' lead systems engineer, Alexander Vetkol, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-based technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It was a provincial store, but there WAS such a product.
In the big cities, Muslim women painted and showed off their henna designs.
So it is in Dushanbe, a big city and the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no such cosmetics.
Five actions are listed that can help prevent diabetes.
Blood sugar level issues are one of the most common in the world.
However, some people do not give this much importance, and that is a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only improper nutrition but also habits can contribute to the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the "weekend migrane" among workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of feeling worse after workdays is often "weekend fatigue", said Zukhra Pavlova, a renowned endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, and head of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine, in her Telegram channel.
According to her, this is especially hard on hard-working people who often experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change in conditions.
Our life fundamentally changes on weekends.
"We sleep too long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "A small breakdown starts due to the lack of coffee."
Due to overgrazing and lack of water - hardship and fragmentation.
The late rise plays an additional role.
Thus, if one stands up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jetlag will occur.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the most decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the "Omikron" virus.
South Africa reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the "Omikron" virus.
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the neutralization level of "Omikron") corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection," the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
The experts clarified that the drug could save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the Omicroon strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar may be listed under an unfamiliar word in the product's ingredients - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Two of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery but also in ketchup, hot dogs, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar may vary in taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is difficult to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as one must take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. already contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total sugar content may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to be climate-neutral by 2045, phasing out the use of gas, oil, and coal.
"That is to say, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States had issued a statement expressing Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline does not currently "comply with the requirements" of the European Union.
Thanks for the great photos!
In 1985 I had to travel to those parts.

Hackers breached the Twitter account of the Indian Prime Minister.
Hackers breached the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators had managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
The Modo office asked to ignore the new messages.
The Prime Minister's representatives stated that Twitter had quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's website was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12th, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's inhabitants voted against independence in the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 inhabitants of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence had called on voters to abstain from voting.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, arguing that the new surge of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago was preventing a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for the third victory of the French New Caledonia supporters, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
The separatists have declared that they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
As announced on Sunday, December 12, President of France Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the results of this referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major topic of discussion in the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zimmermann repeated many times.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be a choice of France".
Hi, Sveta!

Turkey tested the world's first drone with laser weapons.
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first drone with laser weapons.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at distances from 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The apparatus is capable of remotely neutralizing explosive objects with a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the new model reaches 3,000 meters.
After passing the necessary tests, the UAV should be armed to the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the need for sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about Russia-US relations.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he outlined his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite against Russia".
The readers of the Wall Street Journal expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"This article contains a lot of false information," one of the readers commented to RIA News.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
"The United States and its NATO allies will never go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," noted the other.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Seismologists previously recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing next-generation unmanned aerial vehicles.
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial targets, against other unmanned aerial vehicles.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," Dialog.ua quoted him.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are reactive, not piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this new generation of drones surpasses Bayraktar in all characteristics.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory by the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with several private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the joint forces' operations in Donbas.
On December 6th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had begun construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones.
He said that Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev Oblast for training personnel, testing, and servicing Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a "big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the lions took refuge on the roof of a container.
The animals could not move away from it due to the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranqulizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that a lion had escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
On the same day, the animal returned home voluntarily and no people were hurt.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Studies have shown that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folate, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folate are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin, advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to be mindful of dosage, and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folate an anti-aging substance.
Since it is found in avocados, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to April, around 75,000 people may die due to the OMICRON strain.
British scientists' forecasts show that due to the spread of the Omikron strain of coronavirus, up to 75,000 people in England may die in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies of the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25,000 deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, the hospitals will be receiving more than 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Strict measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency had informed that if the rate of spread of the Omikron strain remains at its current level, then by the end of the year, around 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country.
By mid-December, the Omicroon strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of infection with the Omikron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the global ship registry was 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of climate change mitigation, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money for a floating fortress for £50 million or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas before all these people would go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the wealthy and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the wealthy do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, luxuries such as space travel, yacht life, or private jet flights are seen as a source of resentment in society, as the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, though they understand that it will be extremely difficult to implement given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" and a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads, open-air cinemas, and even wrestling rings (as on the wrestler McGregor's yacht) have become commonplace. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic significance when one considers that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that were released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emissions trail was attributed to his 162.5-meter yacht, Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to sail the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke much sympathy from others when, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of colorectal cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol consumption per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is according to the Daily Express.
The experts concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at a two-year-old child's level.
All dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't realize how intelligent four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence develops.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in sequence.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, have no understanding of politics, economics, or art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labrador Retrievers.
Scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade negotiations with the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to resume talks soon on US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite US leader Joe Biden's words about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate, you'll just send the offeror away.
"A trade deal is in the works for Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are done secretly, quickly, and immediately move to offensive operations, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and counter-forces to be deployed," he noted.
China is promoting the development of the railway transportation sector.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Expo held in the city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted the company representative, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies that will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first domestically developed two-story high-speed electric trains for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, a test run of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yao-shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, having conducted a number of independent studies and developments, China has created an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yao-shan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
In an interview with Sputnik Radio, Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion about hearing loss being both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golsheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and deficiencies of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, medical professionals do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of dementia can be helped by studying foreign languages and engaging in active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic," said Goloshekin.
The UK-based dementia research charity has previously stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered to be vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness, specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian ombudsman, to journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"The persistent problems are those of mobility, coordination, and volatility of character," said the specialist, noting that this is not outside the norm and that the ex-president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-neuro-rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began refusing medical assistance after prison service personnel subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
Approximately 3,000 people participated in the rally in the Catalan capital.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters, they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, over 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted a bill on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of illness or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be applied for train and plane trips.

Steep Climb: How the Chinese are Becoming Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million people to winter sports, which will help to achieve the 1 trillion yuan goal set by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taiwu in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, there are also greening works: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main goal for the long-term is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation experience at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizing Adviser, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Mokong, 70 years old, lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chonli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
On the slopes, eateries serving national cuisine are opening up.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach world-class standards.
Over 5 billion people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO declared.
More than 5 billion people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In observance of the 12th of December International Universal Health Coverage Day, WHO and WBG released two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has caused disruptions in health services and has put an excessive strain on health protection systems.
As a result, immunization coverage decreased for the first time in 10 years, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and WB highlighted that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister Disconnected from 'Summit for Democracy' Broadcast at White House Request
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tang, at the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" panel discussion was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the Summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked green as "free" on it, while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the "zero day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption could be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation Yuri Averianov stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Of course, you have to learn a lot of stuff, but... working online allows you to be independent from the internal labor market.
Our country hardly creates any jobs.
And those that create it - you won't make much money from them.

SKETCHES OF A VILLAGE MOSKVICH.
Don't lump them all together - there are bad people out there, you may have specific grievances against them...
But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, etc.?
Write that they are "scoundrels who have not returned the money".
It's none of your business how many and when they have children, until they hang them around your neck.
Since that is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's only in education like this...
The elected (by default) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this applies to other areas of life, such as the judiciary and so on?
The law is not written for them.
What if Dad does implement his own method of upbringing and education?
It's a terrible example and a very bad example for others.

China is strengthening prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring intensified prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection across the border.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will take effect from the day when the corresponding provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities hosting land border crossings that meet certain criteria may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported a "sad conclusion" in the relationship between Russia and the United States.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that a long path of engagement had led to sad conclusions, and the issues between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but as far as any prospect of improvement in relations is concerned, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the issues are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a range of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, except for such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is being made.
Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that its signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal preparation against COVID outside of hospitals.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to set up on-site vaccination points at airports and shopping malls, but I would only do this initially at medical facilities.
The thing is that there is a small chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, but it is advisable for the person to stay near the doctor's office afterwards.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which can be very useful sometimes," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, the idea of vaccinating in shopping centers can be considered when there is enough experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection due to nasal congestion.

It is said that the truly faithful make up the church.
Whether there are truly believers or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would like to be a truly believing one, and each strives to be so.
But no one should say, either about himself or about those who believe as he does, that they alone are truly believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then so can others.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omikron-strain of coronavirus - RT were recorded in one day.
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new Omikron strain of coronavirus were identified in one day.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer oneself," said a Kremlin official on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It has been reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Furthermore, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to convert rubles into dollars.
German Gref, the head of Sberbank, is sure that this is impossible.

Xenia, you don't need to bring anything to my understanding, my understanding is obliged to figure it out itself!
What do you mean by "the incapacity of the mind, severed from the Spirit, to apprehend"?
Imagine you have to explain this to a child who doesn't understand words, how would you do it?
Bear in mind that a child up to 3-5 years old still has open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!
The people of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12th.
96.5% of those who voted were in favor of independence.
Supported the independence of the archipelago in the South Pacific by 3.51% of its inhabitants from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The turnout for voting on that day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is attributed to separatist calls to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the New Caledonia administration, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the Omega strain is less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
There is also evidence of reduced vaccine efficacy against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be less severe than with "Delta" - according to a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU have so far been mild or asymptomatic.
Meanwhile, the new strain, preliminarily, is spreading faster than the "delta" variant.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They had been "immunized earlier," the Gamaliel Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, has stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has identified four scenarios for Zelensky.
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state could lose Western support and possibly make concessions on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko reported this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm," suggests that Ukraine will be abandoned by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its involvement.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices of key commodities that we traditionally export are being reduced <...> internal protests and government resistance with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups)”, added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to internal opposition within the country.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, with the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the former MP, being up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of groups of people and the president who disagree with Zelensky, which could lead to the seizure of control of the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This could be brought about by some event that would be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario could be possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former MP.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11th, a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had dropped to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming Ukrainian presidential elections, only 21.8% of the vote would go to Zelensky, while 14.5% would go to former president Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for telling the story of the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very saddening to hear that.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul; for us residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was live and real-time.
The intensity of emotions was overwhelming, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We also rejoiced in other victories, such as cheering for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I once saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there they were rolling watermelons onto a ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrously large.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, beige color, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The inside side of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace to not stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated through the festoon along the decolletage and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl up in larger sizes.

The poet arrested for the Red Square action said: "They give 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained at Red Square with a poster that read the hashtag #poetryforrussiaisbiggerthanpoetry.
This quote is from the writer Yevheniy Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol under an administrative article for a repeated violation of the order of conducting a public action.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now unfortunately the interest in it has been lost, to the decline of culture in general in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to ascertain the circumstances of his detention and to further elucidate the message of his missive.
How were you treated by the police officers when you were arrested this time and previously?
What did the department ask about your action?
This time, the staff were more polite, the detention was minimal, and the manner was courteous, as funny as that may sound in some contexts of the word.
The OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
They asked the usual question, about motivations.
When heard, they looked at it with understanding, if not approval.
Except for the four-way monkey suit, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
If at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag after the campaign, I won't have wasted these 10 days.
Max, as per the protocol, talk in private even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone can understand what happened in Bonn on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more; incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and still relies on an interpreter.
At official events, stenography is done by hand in the old-fashioned way, and the stenographer does not have to know multiple languages.

Researchers have reported how potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
The research showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root crop contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the systems of the organism to function.
Additionally, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of dietary fiber, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or steamed, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as with other high-glycemic products.
These are carbohydrate-rich foods that break down quickly into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be offset by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results.
Candidates for Departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in the Russian-language internet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive, in part due to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated hit "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called "screening" (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") available.
Sorry, Svetlana M., but I couldn't care less if your son is offended on your behalf or not.
If something is unclear, it's best to just let it go and move on.
It is good, of course, that such things happen rarely.

Lyudmila, the cutting-edge space technology is now in China.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This Polish-developed idea" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely adapted the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
The slogan "The Outskirts are not Russia" actually appeared in 1848.
That, in general, does not really change the essence.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream was to have wings grow on her, but her dad keeps shooting her down.
Well, all this is very dubious.
I got into college, now what?
Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara Wall Lamp.
A wide circumference, framed by "molecules" of light, provides maximum even and bright illumination of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and essence of each object, remains relevant and allows for accentuating the interior in a favorable way.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the lightness of the construction.
By means of thin, almost invisible wires that are regulated in height, the feeling is created that the chandelier is floating in the air.
The metallic gold armature and matte-white miniature shades will easily complement any palette, and the pendant and wall sconces featured in the collection will be a ready-made ensemble for lighting a living room, bedroom, or hallway.
Well, it's all a matter of opinion.
I really liked "Tarkhun", not the current one, of course.
The juices in tall glass cylinders were very delicious.
Three servings of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two was just right.
DimaX Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimat Orthopedic Spring Mattress.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces of varying softness - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
The product is made up of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest caliber.
Springs: a block of independent "micro-packet" springs is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated to each sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micro-Package" is the highest frequency of all the varieties of Dimax springs, so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are placed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is latex, the other is coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillers has long held the status of classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If a coil provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Cover: the model comes with a stretchy Aloe Vera jersey cover.
The customer can choose to make it either removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and Security: Warranty Period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will be searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Actual Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
The third mission is to bring back a sample from Venus.
Assuming that we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth life or different.
If it looks very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
"If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mikkel Pajusalu, leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverse will transform Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
Meta-universes should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digital assetization, where any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are converted into digital formats.
Ana, you are right, changing diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy and unhealthy.
Of course, we will have the traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
Take a spoonful, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
How much hellish labor, time, and resources did she need for her training.
And after five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
She also realizes that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And those who have not gone through the same sport or cannot fathom the circles of hell she has gone through, DO NOT JUDGE.
The British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
He believes that the most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in prices of goods was temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Furthermore, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty alleviation and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Research Department at Open Investments, reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, although the growth potential will be less significant.
Shulgin listed the risks to the dollar as the Federal Reserve's monetary and credit policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if we compare ourselves to five years ago, there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is slow.
There is also the problem that there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
Any kind of eco-taxes that take away waste from the home.
Yes, the scrapyard is a popular spot for the marginalized.
Few people bring glass and metal there.

Russians gave auto dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars in the 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To put it into perspective - roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia leads in terms of revenue in the Russian market.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia, the sister brand of Hyundai, saw an even greater increase of over 35%, with car sales revenue estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the top positions, this brand and in terms of increasing the average car price - for Hyundai it grew by almost 21% over the year, to 1.94 million rubles - the price increase dynamics was only stronger for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
Meanwhile, Korean brands saw less significant growth in sales: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has seen both sales volume (up 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (nearly 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) grow.
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing good growth in sales and average price - more than BMW, for example - which is driving the financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands have demonstrated fantastic figures, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies whose sales of cars in units fell in 2021 are financially constrained: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand for 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amid supply issues with auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" has raised the price of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Automakers regularly revise their prices for their products and other products.
Russia's car market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the face of car shortages, I think many automakers were even able to pass on some of the costs of past periods that they could not incorporate into the car prices before.
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital's auto industry. -
I believe that automakers are feeling very good financially right now, sustaining high margins on sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed throughout 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantity and in money terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, and automakers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the production of machines is not expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by the citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, notes the expert.
Biden spoke about the possibility of deploying US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
President of the United States Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There were never any such plans," the White House head declared in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized, however, that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the table.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, all those NATO countries that we have a solemn obligation to protect from any Russian aggression," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukrainian territory.
He also noted that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.
If I'm already expected to listen to shouting, wait for hours, drink some strange brew and wash another cup at the interview, I can only imagine what it would be like to work there.
I will find a good place for myself, without a middleman, where I can talk directly to the manager.

If a scammer calls from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement agency, it is not effective to hang up immediately, and it is unlikely to be able to add it to the blacklist.
Because to back up his lie about being part of the military he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and coerce.
More useful recommendations for the people are needed.
That's nonsense.
I simply don't believe it was like that.
They don't know who to blame anymore.

Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...

I can even smile at you on the outside.
But I remember that thought is material!

The main protagonist of the film is a UN translator who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists" directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), it tells the story of the complex relationship between a domineering father and his children who are trying to break free from his control in North Ossetia.
It has been announced earlier that this movie has been nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
As evidenced by the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of the loop.
