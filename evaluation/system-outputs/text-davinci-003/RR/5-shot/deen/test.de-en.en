The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
It costs 179€ today.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Quickly look, quickly help, bring the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy himself for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
For if something were to happen such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken up by a female detective who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
It turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, ultimately forcing them to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to her death intentionally)
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the general plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail.
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child is having a hysterical reaction when we try.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

Johnson to push for Omikron booster shots due to Omikron.
New Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron figures than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date had previously been the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that they are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I suggest that everyone introduce themselves with pronouns.
I sent off an application.
Today I received an invitation to a meeting by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter" but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How could such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Tried first on #PRS_ORG#.
But that's been working for about.
No more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content Warning: I will be discussing domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to my profession.
One issue that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg's Derby Debacle at Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But the tension didn't ease after the game - it increased even more after the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the result itself was the manner of the performance.
To illustrate the whole dilemma, here's a statistic: the three-point shooting rate was only 13 percent, with 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - need we say more?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We just weren't focused enough after our win at Tenerife and didn't execute what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim, his counterpart, reacted very differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While even the top performers on Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
The Giants only prevented a total disaster in the last quarter (22:15) when they managed to get within eight points after being down 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Always looking sharp: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently touring with the show "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on government orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for now, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up for the dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with great enthusiasm since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020. dpa
Hi #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and this way we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, housing cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to decide how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hi, I wanted to order something and I noticed after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come back?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great!
Then I will redeem it automatically with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to sweep through the United States.
More than 100 deaths could be reported in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, possibly claiming up to one hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
Do I understand correctly that I can now order the ceiling and have it shipped to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The re-purposing of advertising slogans into calls to get vaccinated - modeled after Germany - is intended to increase willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron Greetings!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the action will develop further.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the hero and lure him into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the option to resolve confrontations in different ways: convincing, bargaining, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres.
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the hero in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the village mayor's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still here, all is great.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina as an approach to Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure to start with?
The Goblin group will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the returns sent over so I can package up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1.
Hi F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky has been decreasing throughout the season, so I'm making this post to vent a bit.
Firstly, the broadcast was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the starting accident put the schedule far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!)
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority, so everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it was foolish, especially since Sky UK had broadcast the race to its conclusion.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first time they've had to guess what is allowed or required by the rules, they both just have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
Added to this are constant sillinesses that make them both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, Sky's advertising is simply out of control, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV as it only has to rely on the German audio track without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While I must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sports F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So, in any case, the great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'm curious to hear your opinion.
One #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass.
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not heard anything back yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am asking for your support.
Fan pumps are great for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK Series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an atomizer or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and be mounted externally.
If the circulation pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, in the event of water flowing backwards, the water from the basin running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we list the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take a few precautions so that no one gets upset if something takes a bit longer.
It is so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course here Corona does not stop.
Please don't rate us badly just because the delivery is delayed, it is entirely due to the courier services.
People of course like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really tough time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can I also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the freshly-minted astronauts back upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961 and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reflected on her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his deployments.
She just flew along with it, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He said he would love to go back to space again, the host said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was decelerated by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's Deputy Chief, Audrey Powers, were present.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to color change, the luminescent stone will maintain a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative hue.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp is proven to be suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In a snowy environment, its light stands out even more - however, it is expected to have a shorter lighting duration as the days get shorter.
Please be sure to check in the winter that no snow is affecting the solar module's performance.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the standard Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can purchase a compatible replacement battery through our online store to extend the life of your decorative light.

Someone who works in or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
I had of course already done some research on career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to and would study until I got my PhD.
I am currently having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one hears about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, but on the other hand one also hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what qualifications do you have?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really uncertain and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
Extra Stress During Holiday & Weekend Breaks
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why a post is only now being added.
Not only during major holidays like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems like it's available even on holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Fridays, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A flurry of emails that had to be sent out before Ascension Day, orders here and orders there, all *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... well, why?
Because "next week then" sounds like too much time has passed and that can't be the case?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed holiday lockdown about?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know this in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
"The beauty is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
She still has a lot to do before the holidays: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I really need to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is due to nutritional errors.
Since feathers are composed of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is necessary for the formation of a perfect plumage in birds.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the feather loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, still not working.
DDR Handcrafted Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive from AEG for the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, receiving the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived World War II and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn Repair Works in Dessau, the need for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were given priority in the assembly process.
It was only when it became clear that the recovery rate of the E 94 could not be increased further that the E 95 came into focus for recovery.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives aged, the complex controls became increasingly problematic.
It was not uncommon for shooters to get stuck during shifting operations.
Then the fireman who was constantly travelling on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the couplings during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and caused months of downtime for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and there was no plan for a significant expansion of electric operations, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, was retired on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives except E 95 02 were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a point heating system at Halle Main Station as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was internally completed in 1986.
The locomotive is being preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Heritage Society have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves to be reliable and low maintenance due to their efficient drive.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to the Central German Network in Leipzig.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-Parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with errors.
The middle bar does not fit into the designated holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No flats.
According to the assembly instructions, those are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose.
They're not flat on me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage.
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Police have taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false reports on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
"My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
Şahin further wrote that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am legally not allowed to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination with the vaccine in Germany.
By now, the prioritization has been lifted - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power.
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday night, 41,000 residents in several communities were affected by the power outage.
Supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
He explained that the repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally put some of the lines back into operation.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
The fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back up.
Over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again since Saturday at 6pm.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 PM.
As of 11:15 PM, those affected by the outage would have electricity again.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and stay safe ♡
I can't mount the bracket on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot slide it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return it as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Let's do it then!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message "Ups!"
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupted, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean application of the paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply a new color to the model with the brush for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts where it won't be seen later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component
Brush the paint evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark colors could show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can result in unsightly metal streaks when mixed with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before assembling them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or transfers.
From national insignia on aircraft to ship names and trim and badges on car models, decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also known as water-slide decals because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you just slide the image a little bit away from the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Warning: Always check that the image is correctly positioned before completely sliding it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or tear.
Wipe away any excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book for a short time, and once I look away I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place I was up to.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
For all three packages too?
Because the lamp arrived in three separate packages.
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I be able to get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone!
We have been undergoing fertility treatments for some time, but now the private health insurance company is suddenly refusing to pay for it.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment with the private health insurance in advance and were granted approval for 3 attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet claim them with the private health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first offer expire.
The second wish for a child should be a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the room:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (5 attempts are to be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
OK.
We will not be ordering anything from them anymore.
If you add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously have lost good customers.
You can certainly forward that to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been processed and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the chest of drawers arrived completely damaged.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clearly stated that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two loyal customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I am not able to procure a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cupboard and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a low-budget film, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A low-budget film or movie is a motion picture produced with minimal financial investment from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I would like to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'm going to give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, according to the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This limbo state - Belarus doesn't quite give in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There appears to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion of the Union at the same time.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt at crossing the border again
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
Bossong said the most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has thrown its weight around and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting, extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
Mercedes believes Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest has been lodged against Max Verstappen in the Red Bull for an alleged breach of regulations during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was made shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking it.
I'm speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day.
Europa-Park, namesake of the SC Freiburg's Europa-Park Stadium, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white that day by the jerseys.
The park said, "Foxes, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons created the perfect backdrop."
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in existence since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park has once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing the delighted guests having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

I had a huge problem with you back then when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and is sensitively attuned to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I haven't received any email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is if my inquiry has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and cheap, misdelivered goods from China.
Your mistake to fix, not all from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package needs to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yes, wow, then you are just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
God put this whole thing in motion for me.
But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically distortion- and color-free even in the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification ratings.
However, these figures only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your magnifying glass, please refer to the Technical Data table (see user manual in the package) for instructions.
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When used under optimal conditions - lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz community select the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has experienced some strange situations in the process.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer?!
I have received a defective shipment and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to debate which dish is better here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan which received and sent 50 Mbps perfectly, apart from a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module which transmits the wifi, not all 500 come through, but the further away I am in the house from the module, the less comes through (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This has resulted in the internet being slower than before (\~45 Mbit) even with the new fibre connection in the first floor.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch bank accounts
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, they are mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She has now halved the allowance and even quartered it for the current account.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Now, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were successful in the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Banks are now discussing whether they should set aside reserves in case higher courts declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine The Hollywood Reporter as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
Nevertheless, Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to both female and male fans alike.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on medically with me, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Unceremonious End to a Career: Raikkonen Forced to Retire
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the barrier, Raikkonen had to retire his Alfa Romeo from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport's top class.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's record of 94 wins is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he tweaked the material setting and on Sunday pulled out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat out the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it too," Lochner said.
Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka
On the women's side, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She notched up her Olympic qualification and her first podium finish of the winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get first place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am really happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential to be tapped, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just pushing off, there is also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked about it.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now they said it had expired, which made me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again since it's on sale :)
Why is the shipment starting on 16/3?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls, girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's pretty much my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs too and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also under the weather and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having tummy ache right now, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to do homework too, which we obviously have to divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently well managed, I'm halfway through my therapy and I'm doing okay.
Not great, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Just two more days until the weekend.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on and on.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams without it.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I would find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 12/26/#NUMBER#.
Twice, for that matter.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It always felt strange to me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed it.
What is your opinion on this?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something?
Hope this question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I would be happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, so I would advise against it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie.
Hello everyone!
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman, whom I cannot describe in more detail in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's tomb.
In the end, both soldiers fight each other, I believe.
If this rings a bell, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take a lot more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Watch your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the stomach?
Or is it face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to put babies to sleep on their stomachs.
We are also already a "regular customer" of yours and have purchased many items already.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and haven't heard back yet.
This is regarding my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I kindly request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno's quote: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A generic advertising channel trying to push its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These apply to everyone naturally, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
Krogmann, who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I am requesting a call back as the wooden table I received was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - My Little Heat Friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable for use as a heat pad only for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mold, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, shake the pillow to evenly distribute the heat!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first warmings, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Make sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion is placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your inner arm!
Do not use the cushion in cases of acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain sensitivity.

Darmstadt Second After First Half - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Ingolstadt is not doing well even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charging through my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up even with the power adapter plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have some ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat area is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack!
The 20-liter capacity swallows larger photo gear with ease, which can be securely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday life, it stays well organized and separate from your photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design packs a punch - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still granting instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an ingeniously designed solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second feature that sets the Everyday Backpack apart from other camera backpacks is the dual zipper access on both sides of the bag in addition to the top lid.
This eliminates the biggest downside of traditional top-loading backpacks - you don't have to rummage through your stuff anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
The Everyday Backpack allows you to customize the interior (more on that below) so you can easily store and access both items separately through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while keeping your everyday items safely in the left backpack half and not getting in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the exterior of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company has announced contact to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any news yet.
I request immediate settlement.
I am now on my third support staff member and none of them have been able to do more than promise me an email confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it possible to predict when the cabinet will be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and not return it.
I could not have foreseen that last year would turn out differently than expected, and I was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Despite his attempts to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have had the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneering colleagues or you will go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the site, reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the announcer turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough Gunslingers and outnumber the Bandit, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel post (games wrapped in foil) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse.
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, so I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
His book "Why Our Kids Are Becoming Tyrants" (2008) sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Us parents and other responsible adults must never, ever, ever! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation, as is sensible and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries Discussing Removal of Testing Requirement for Triple Vaccinated
The Health Ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been triple vaccinated at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing obligation can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday next week. - AFP

Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?

What you are describing is referred to as "Awareness", which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthetic is avoided in order to protect the baby until it is delivered.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however u/Nitemarex had none by definition.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce, in addition to legal requirements.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
One more time, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to the doorstep due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I need to cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not going to be called?
I had posed a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as an impresario.
He later wrote a monumental history of theatre.
Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is the new book, fresh off the press, on the table: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The Shattering Diary of a Slow Farewell to the World, kept by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has passed away.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give thanks for my life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly in Europe as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
According to Statistics Austria data, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins first MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference Finals, New York had prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
We had that for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I'm hooked and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I can manage this.
This is for a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18/01 that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not come to me.
Please check that.
Where to find Christmas Roast in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust the desired level and distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, allowing you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a power reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal presented here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an extremely "acoustic" sound impression.
You can plug in a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to return them.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on something I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Agreement
Iranian officials have reported progress in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" as there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated at first.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a near one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence in Germany.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only state in Germany to have a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia had slightly decreased but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
Two hundred people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
It may be possible by then, since the delivery is not until early March.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/fill out/specify anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, so that is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping at my own expense.
I think an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It's time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we are generally perceived.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the Bundestag.
#What We Need to Change
Here, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to take this opportunity to explicitly call on everyone to participate, as only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Objectives:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be amended/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some stuff, but that's okay, we have Discord for that at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the #PRS_ORG# day blanket come in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I do not have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had been a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I used to think that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I got the impression that she was becoming disgruntled, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, she was reducing animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me even trying to create them.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot be present due to a funeral, so that cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
I will be available again from February 1st.
Lahnsteiner Fire Department Equipped for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, Mayor of Lahnstein.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a continuous increase in activity: the boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed, and re-downloaded the app and NOTHING worked.
I'm getting frustrated because this whole process has taken up so much of my time and I'm hoping for some help now.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thanks for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive, but I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people on the right are naturally attracted to uniforms and weapons, but it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
Even these fringe groups, though it may sound strange at first, in my experience tend to have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by overly left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposedly fighting for them or trying to do them right, when all they want is to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme right-wingers there, but it is completely exaggerated by the media to say that they are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-threatening plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions, due to negative experiences, begin to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain ideological comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I believe that such things are well combated and that political education and awareness are used to counter it!
Germany is so internationally intertwined that, in my opinion, we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered it back in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could we deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany, or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Neatened by a child?
Hi, I (w32) have been wondering about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am independent and have very little free time), but I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized for my entire life.
There are always times when everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "so that someone could come over spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because I don't have any motivation to do it, it doesn't bother me as long as there are no visitors and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child motivate you to be more organized or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your replies.
An exclusive, new and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, extended embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends).
The Focea Comfort 4 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System 2 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows and knees).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending and donning/doffing equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face seal at the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone at the collar improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lining or seams.
Double cuffs with zippers at the arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, camouflaged neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zip (suit without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for increased durability.
Inner cuff edges notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxious-avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have low self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The code review is already causing me problems (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by return?
When I download a book to my #PRS_ORG#, I get the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book."
Are there any issues?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its digestive tract into individual protein components (amino acids) and then builds its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in nestlings and moulting in adult birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruption to the breeding cycle.
After this curative dose of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and then builds its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the moulting of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruption to the breeding cycle.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.
1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level scoop (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but this chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Application for felling submitted to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, and thus walnuts, is not part of the statute.
The charter explicitly states that the walnut tree is to be protected.
Can I trust the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I need to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03 hrs), a car has crossed into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Oh, I see.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career life.
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... In short: I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I am now on my third "googling other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
For the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and finish the sketch at least, then I can always switch afterwards.
But right now I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moment.
Now even family gatherings are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place a year from now, feeling dissatisfied again.
You can see that everything is kind of a mess, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views can help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation is at least somewhat clear now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continually evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely cutting-edge in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, as they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system that produces natural resonances in abundance.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even tweak and bend historical facts in the virtual realm to get your amp and effects sounding just the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp stage is the key to the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, of each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers shine, but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook and loop dividers, it can be adjusted to fit your photo equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an attachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those with a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is the end in sight?
At 85 days long, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There is no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
Activity from the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are still unable to predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damages.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, with damages estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas of approximately 50 hectares in total were formed by cooled lava.
The banana crop, which is immensely important to the island and is the source of livelihood for about half of the 85,000 inhabitants, was severely affected, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children especially can hardly wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became Santa Claus
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days to gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in some form or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and humans as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it only annoys a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all countries with a Christian background, there is a cheerful confusion about who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has achieved some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Otherwise buy another e-book from #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Since I haven't received one yet (not even in my spam folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the royal palace.
A man armed with a weapon was shot by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum luminous duration of 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with color from within.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rockery.
It also does well in the company of larger pebbles and rocks, where its size allows it to hold its own.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "luminous stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide secure anchoring when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and one for colored light.
The battery starts charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; you decide what color: in addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shutdown will also be automatic once the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if my coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.

The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "AutoTune" feature allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello, ladies!
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
As for my problem: About five years ago, I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem is not the pain but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and it was all over my body.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and I still have an appointment with the dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of nutrition in the course of Christian illness and have stayed on a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else has really worked well.
It may also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have problems everywhere like I do, you don't want to go looking for what else might be wrong.
I had already given everything to your colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone in between, and then suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
But is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is widely available in black

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgement.
In the courtroom, they are seated on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them discussed their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court in an interview with "Oeffentlichen": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hi, unfortunately I can't log into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping it for that long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in gray.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pick up and refund?
And when would the pick-up be?
110 kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the laying of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The Government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pole of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03/01/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived with us in parts so far.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about it, I already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the same for all books, which is why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning Lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I am currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I'm currently having a hard time planning my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need time for other activities).
I usually start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) when planning and then think about how to structure it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We read the book Terra and I am mostly dissatisfied with the tasks presented in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are now only allowing entry to those who are vaccinated or recovered.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, the CEO of HDE, criticized that there were sales declines in stores selling non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had written off the Christmas trade already.
"What should have been the high point of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food retail sector and in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with masks, social distancing and hygiene protocols is a safe affair, said the CEO.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations were discouraging customers and requiring a lot of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation should be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the band received.
Furthermore, in retail, as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75% of pre-corona levels without 2G, with revenues at around 90%.
"These figures will now certainly drop in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the Centers.
This includes the so-called bracelet solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which has been attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is its ease of use and intuitive operation.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
The control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display, is located on the back of the lamp.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set up the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - with a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve connection for mounting, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using locking devices on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won two consecutive games, were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned it up, shot off the frustration of a mediocre season start within an hour and won brilliantly with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved,".
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who were still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 in the lead.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
"And then the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is huge," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular delight for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players are living a highly professional lifestyle as well.
Now they want to "go step by step and stay humble" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the end of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6:30 PM, Sky).
I just got an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and place the order again?
That would unfortunately mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after their humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Championship, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged German national team coach Henk Groener.
We have to show up differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game all around that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
To make it to the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start of the match.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
This was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was effectively over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke was shown a red card shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game a bit better and at least came within five goals of the opposition by half-time.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes when the score was 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster any further performance and left the court as the clear loser.

Does that work for you?
The title is that I am a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be largely completed, it will then proceed in part to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a specific person (e.g. "I am taking medication X, will that be compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include providing information about the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is entitled to a vaccine according to the Coronaimpfveordnung and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have a doctor, but "only" (God forbid no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger Knows the Answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused a lot of thought in the BR television show "We in Bavaria".
But unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed by the callers in the "Host mi?" series this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
Nor anyone who needs everything to happen quickly.
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that "the huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - even for many who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for road racing - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing, and my back tire was not willing to go any further.
Since I had no real chance to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't too bad weather-wise, so maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would really not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
It wasn't really bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of driving, I'm probably going to be in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, this all sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire only to be disappointed in the end.
I'm also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are Marathon Plus tires that are apparently that narrow, but most are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD based on my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central island for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new addition and visually resembles its big brothers with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a specially designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and impressively and accurately proportionate for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight high-end boost in tone.
This is generally common with broadband antennas to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By turning slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of each component of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-grade extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8mm hole in the bottom board at the corresponding location in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush mounted later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM will receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, you start to build the box by placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the DIY store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The second side will be attached in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The footplate is then firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal are then marked and pre-drilled (2.5 mm drill bit).
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), the laying of the cable begins.
This is most easily achieved through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
Push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of cable sticking out.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
The crossover is then prepared and installed.
The crossover design and corresponding wiring diagram can be found in the following document: Solo 15 Crossover Assembly Manual.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With a bit of skill, you can drop hot glue onto the 35mm bass reflex opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a sheet of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone!
We are excited to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant an increased planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be on the call, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 12:30.
Get the drinks chilled, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
