Students Sing Lead Roles at Zhejiang University Academic Conference, Research Results Open Up New Horizons - Xinhua News
Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of creative academic achievements were commended, such as washing hands with air, judging diseases by sniffing, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious point, the students created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Check-up Doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor the size of half a smartphone that can be connected to a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe out lightly and this instrument can detect the components of the breath you exhale to give an initial indication of your health."
Zhang Diming introduced that the set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smartwatches that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-Energy Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up a new thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are detected and removed too late due to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs that can be adjusted to enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing your hands: Saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rubbing some soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a "air hand-washing device".
As soon as we step onto the apparatus, our weight compresses the air out of it.
"It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
"That way, we can get our hands nice and clean!"
Colorimetric response and bacterial residue tests showed that the effect of handwashing by this method was the same as that of conventional handwashing.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the sole gold medal.
Please arrange for a replacement to be sent to me as soon as possible, thank you.

No problem, thank you.
A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid is actually emergency care given in response to an emergency situation, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency aid.
If I were to suffer a cardiac arrest, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes, the golden four minutes, to save my life!
So how important it is to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue them with professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
"In China, we have official data that three million people die from accidents every year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous."
The national average in the United States is 15% survival rate.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This was the first response from the founder, Lu Le.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to have a chance of saving the person.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
It might even save a life!
First aid certificates can be obtained at your local Red Cross training center. I got mine at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is of my list of goals to accomplish before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
After that, I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried.
How come #NAME# isn't making it clear?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# sent me only one shrimp dumpling?!
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say that the movie isn't at least a bright spot, the soundtrack selection is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, from the kind that make you fall asleep in the theater to the kind that make you angry after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and full of holes, like the windbreaker on Little Horse.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find it is actually just a pile of crap.
Let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south with his grandmother as his only companion.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
Elderly people taking a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his dad were very reassured by this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
How can the island's biker gang thugs easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road and the truck drivers around could not be found.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a delinquent and suspected criminal biker gang member become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't the protagonist report the usury to the police in the movie, even though the police asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key to open a hotel door, and then proceeds to try to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door for the night?
This nonsensical plot was pervasive throughout the film, and I find myself in pain when I recall it due to its absurdity.
Worse than the plot, or lack thereof, was the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which was a hideous patchwork of a mess.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you might guess it was a motivational film, halfway through you felt it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, and after watching it you had no idea what you had just seen, followed by deep doubt about why you had gone to the cinema to watch crap over the holidays.
For most people, it is also very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(Like the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character got burned and then still sang a song), you can't go and open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female lead who clearly isn't mentally challenged yet behaves in some ways like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I'm also quite puzzled as to why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file meant to add to the audience's troubles?

Chongqing Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Program - Students Enter as Enterprises' Probationary Employees - Xinhua News
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures for secondary vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of apprentices as secondary vocational school students and potential employees of enterprises be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, a tripartite agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the school, and the enterprise. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18, a four-party agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party, as well as the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection for the apprentice during the on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform their talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise shall jointly design a talent cultivation program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training cycle as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. The top-post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, 1 master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot program having around 50 people and a total of around 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, increase their employment rate and improve the quality of employment.

South African Doctors: Omikron is Highly Contagious but Mostly Mild Cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, the Omecronon, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omnicron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-strong organization of doctors in the Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs, similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the Director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pilley said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this included elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill if they contract the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he was treating had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels".
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omikron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in recent weeks, only 30% were severely ill, half the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Institute for Health Research, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications point to this being a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still early days and we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.”
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delata still being the major coronavirus strain globally, cases of the Omikron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, there was a 400% increase in new cases found in the first week of December in the Hauden Province, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Times Review: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we apply the famous public service slogan "No demand, no supply" to this situation, then in a good environment where there is no demand for trafficking, collective prevention and public anti-trafficking can make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children on the anti-trafficking platform developed by the bureau.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to facilitate the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing the name of this App, "Reunion", I feel a warmth.
The new technical means not only have a name full of "literary" and feelings, but also are practical and effective when used in an information-based way.
The primary objective of anti-trafficking enforcement is to recover trafficked children and protect their safety and freedom.
Secondly, comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is broken, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
We should prioritize urgent matters over less pressing ones. Controversial topics such as "Should child trafficking be punishable by death" can be put aside for more careful discussion, but the rescue of trafficked children must not be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers usually leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in a missing child case increases the distance between the child and their parents and makes the case more difficult to solve.
In this context, it is indeed a practical action to take out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which can directly help to crack cases and find missing children.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be in operation.
In combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Furthermore, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is a family of three resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, one should at least have a reasonable level of protective awareness.
Taking turns to rest or placing children in a safe environment are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the fight against trafficking in persons, those who purchase trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of illegality is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of five years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and the property shall be confiscated.
With the trend of "leniency" in sentencing, the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the category of crimes with heavier punishments, with a high starting point and a maximum penalty.
To this day, there are still a significant number of cases of trafficking occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread and traffickers are driven by greed and constantly innovating their methods, a "cat-and-mouse" situation will emerge between traffickers and law enforcement, making anti-trafficking efforts inefficient.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 6th Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress at Mt. Malan.
Draw strength from the Party's hundred-year struggle.
On the morning of December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a standing member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Ma'er Mountain Video and Cultural Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, learn and implement the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and learn and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, combining his own insights and personal experiences, systematically and comprehensively explained the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leadership and party theory.
He pointed out that it was necessary to combine the spirit of the plenary session and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech in Hunan, the spirit of the provincial party congress, and to learn and integrate them, strengthen the ideological, political, and action awareness of defending the "two establishements" and achieving the "two maintenances", and firmly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives from the grassroots, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Party, to unite closely around the Party Central Committee, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and commitment with youth dedication.

Actually, not sure if it was the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
No receipts on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery was 30 minutes faster than indicated
No, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been swapped in.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the works.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering of fresh olives, after removing impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
Delicious with a delicate plant aroma and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavor, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from the pomace by solvent extraction.
Having seen the grading classification, you should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
It should be noted that olives, like grapes used for winemaking, come from different regions and different olive varieties, which will produce different grades of olive oil.
Best Growing Areas for Olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olives, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, cultivation is only possible in suitable areas in scattered locations.
Main Production Areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others, as well as countries further south such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, which have similar climates.
Months for Olive Harvesting
From March to June each year, the olive tree flowers and sets fruit, and from July to October the fruit develops and matures, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for harvesting the fruit (freshness is key for olive oil).
Nutritional Components of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden declaring that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also indicated that plans are in place to convene the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative, political affairs commissioner Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how hard the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because, as I have said before, the democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" were respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also noted that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guanzhong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.”
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng delivered a video statement of the "National Declaration", emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interest, leading to a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down to control the epidemic, nor do we need to take down to defeat false information.
On the second day of the "Summit on Democracy", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, as well as investment restrictions against a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time kept getting delayed.
#NUMBER# originally
Anyway, I'm not calling.
No more eating.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
Waiting for you so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
A diner waited for one and a half hours.
#PRS_ORG# Not Delivered
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the Saliva Chicken sent by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something similar at a similar price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one, this kind of "entry-level" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, the ball hits the racket and the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't be held, and it is difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of this is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy something expensive, so let's give you a cheap one, you'll play it twice and then you won't play it anymore, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come to me and buy the expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, choosing Prince or Dunlop, which are both not famous enough so that good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200, isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it is a letdown after the newbie stage, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the newbie stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the salted chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# arbitrarily asked me to take it, please cancel it.
The order I placed was for delivery, there was no option for self-collection.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls who are slightly overweight when it comes to dressing.
The skirt of a chubby girl should not be too short or too long, the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
Wearing a skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Being too long gives a short and chubby impression.
If you wear three different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks, it will make you look taller naturally. It will create a sense of elongation when you wear different colors.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and a noble and elegant black skirt is the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more mainstream the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Avoid giving the impression of being overweight by drawing attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should avoid tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or mesh tights (the kind with small holes) should be worn. Choose a soft-textured printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a drape neck top to cover up the flaws of plus-size girls.
Of course, there is a certain finesse to dressing a slightly plump girl in a short skirt.
For a plus-size girl wearing a short skirt, it is recommended to choose a top in the same color as the skirt, which will give the illusion of added height to your curvy figure.
Pairing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, and it's the hottest look of the summer!
If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous-looking mini dress.
Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts are slimming and are great for curvy girls. Choose a tighter top to create a layered look that will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a skirt is a look that even plus-sized women can try.
Curvy girls can also look fashionable.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
In addition to changes in clothing combinations, exercise more in life and strive to get out of the label of "slightly fat girl" one day earlier 😄

Girl Used as Target for Sister's Fundraising: "It's Better Than Flesh Wounds" - Xinhua News
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board, slightly taller than a person, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passersby can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl Street "Archery Target" Fundraising Warned
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl is standing in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow". On another board in front of her are written her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens thought it was a "begging for attention" behavior, while many others expressed sympathy.
"We discovered the situation around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already a lot of onlookers."
Police officers from the nearby Tian Shui police station told local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and attractive manner.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passers-by to play the game; the other girl was on the side, shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, they resorted to this behavior as they could not think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were present, one as the target and the other as the shooter, but neither of them actually participated in the shooting. No one was found to be shooting arrows, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
Subsequently, the police were informed by the security department that the bow and arrow used did not fall within the category of controlled weapons.
The responsible person stated that "this type of fundraising for publicity is not encouraged".
After being warned by the police officers at the station, she had left the station.

What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Also Win Gold Medals in the Olympics" was very popular, mentioning that project managers can be the first in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more common.
The seemingly jokey article also speaks to the daily struggles of project managers, representing the current frustration with project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
The increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certifications being taken each year indicates that more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, with about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The increasing number of PMP certified professionals over the past decade indicates that more and more project managers are realizing that simply relying on old "tried and true" methods is no longer sufficient, and that the ever-changing work environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
But does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners have expressed that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they still feel confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to practice them; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, project dragging on; unclear division of labor among members, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor communication between departments, difficulty in advancing the project...
Therefore, with more than ten years of focus on product innovation and R&D management, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D personnel such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It brings the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" here.
"Project Manager Bootcamp" Online Course This is a way of learning online in fragments, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of research and development enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training of project managers at lower costs and with less investment, resulting in efficient operational outcomes for the business.
Actions speak louder than words, so let's take a look at what other students have to say about the course: This course is not only presented by the Zhongtian Hua Xia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiexin Promotes Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The various discounts and coupons, as well as the eye-catching live streaming of goods, have once again brought great benefits to consumers. On the one hand, this consumer boom has made people marvel at the strength of national consumption power, but on the other hand, it is also necessary to take a step back and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to set up a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
Elderly and young people have relatively low levels of financial literacy, so "one old and one young" will still be the focus of sustained attention in financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is contrary to the label of "excessive extravagance" attached by the outside world, some young people do indeed have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
Over the years, CSC has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has been subtly guiding the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities and launching innovative practice competitions, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Always plan ahead when spending and be mindful of your repayment schedule.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Credit China will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified financial products with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Net - GCC Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on the tour of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman included Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this marks the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and his Arab allies to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis began in mid-2017, when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo against it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely impacted the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative effect on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar by taking the lead in appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of differences to restore relations with Qatar was driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States consider that it is deficient to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the slowing of economic growth among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC Summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar was resolved.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures that enable its Member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust in the New Territories!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar from Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Priced at nearly two million Ringgit, with road tax of tens of thousands of Ringgit per year and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either, but the data says that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that while it takes my Myvi to reach 30km/h, this car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Not much needs to be said about the model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, it's so uncomfortable! (But kind of cool)
1km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (as you might get stuck halfway out of the cockpit).
The engine noise is so loud that you will be deafened when you get off (but it's still awesome).
The body of the car is too big, so it will be too narrow to park in a regular parking space, I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next to it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely since there's no one to compete with on the road (said by the editor, not the driver, haha).
No misunderstanding, the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please contact us!
More car information you don't know about, at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involving a car crash worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
On that day, a million-dollar 911 and a ten-million-dollar Chiron were destroyed in a matter of minutes!
You were right to have a look at the results!
Resonating the University Spirit with the Times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over time in the development process of a university, and is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of the university has been of paramount importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and global competition in education, technology and talents is intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for the Promotion of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" not only demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of the world's top universities in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of school running; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape brand, and enhance image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to recognize that the construction of world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, and each school must highlight its own personality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The characteristics of the school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we emphasize three characteristics in our school-running: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University-Industry-Research Cooperation System.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment and Pragmatism", and the latest expression of the Zhejiang Spirit of "Absorbing the Rivers and Seas, Cultivating True Virtue, Opening Up the World and Building Our Nation" constitute the core of the university's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mentality of "using talents from all over the world" and embodying the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development and innovation; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share weal and woe with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of education.
"The wise hear without listening, and the discerning see without looking."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission shouldered by higher education in the current era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, upholding humanistic care and independent freedom, allowing the spirit of the university to stimulate the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly becoming popular, the crypto community came up with another new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some of the residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to gain a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-raising game that combines a variety of gameplay, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project with a total transaction volume of over $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue is over 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just a single role, they can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This agency is not granted by the game developer, but is secured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing the news about my friend's stock was the choice of track for the enterprise, i.e. the choice of investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics is about "doing the right things", i.e. doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the correct thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and most tactical thinking has space for strategic thinking.
For example, in terms of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, making it the first time Bitcoin has been a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital markets, further expanding the investment aperture for cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua
More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yu-Kong said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria of US top universities had doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top US universities had remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been engaging in "long-term, sustained, and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yu reported that research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that, relative to the number of applicants, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate of all ethnicities in the three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students, with Yale University and Brown University having effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua reporters that they hoped that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained-of universities to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian Americans.
The three universities that have been complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups participating in the appeal, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups were also involved.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhoutian Town, Yuyao from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family of the house owner, Mr. Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit shall be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit shall be returned to the buyer double; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week".
However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contractual terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was frustrated and angry when the seller backed out of the deal at the last minute, after he had found the house he wanted and had already paid the deposit and prepared the payment for the house.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court for this.
The court, after hearing the case, found that the failure to sign a formal contract was not solely attributable to the defendant, and should be reasonably assumed to be the result of failed negotiations, and thus the penalty of double return of the deposit should not apply, and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract.
The plaintiff appealed after the first judgment.
Recently, the court of appeals upheld the original verdict.
[Legal Notice] Exercise due diligence and care during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Following the conclusion of the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" was "drawing lines of ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, acting in the name of democracy but in fact against it, stirring up division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has already become a 'mass-destructive weapon' of US interference in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held virtually, with 111 global leaders invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have been international and domestic criticisms of the summit, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Scholz, also participated in the video democratic summit.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "Today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor," and that democracy in the US is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be a buffer and a bulwark against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces sustained and worrying challenges".
The United States committed to launching a year-long effort following the Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

Red Label Whisky Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich, aromatic flavor and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.

Educational Thinking: How College Exams Can Benefit Both "Geeks" and "Slackers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In a university campus, students come from all walks of life with varying abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation very diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will certainly create a completely different feeling.
Students who do not put in effort may be able to pass the exam by cramming before it, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a "strange situation" where "underachievers" can pass the exams and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores on exams.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without cause in their complaints about the problems in university exams, and it is likely that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, kudos should be given to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have been to university know that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try to get exam questions from teachers, bargain for the scope of the exam, and even cheat during the exam or ask the teacher for special favors after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not lies more in the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to specialize, with many courses focusing on foundational knowledge.
It goes without saying that the mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically composed of subject basic theories and basic common sense, and from the knowledge point of view, the space of change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basics of mathematics that were taught in college 20 years ago are still being taught, and still emphasized."
However, the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
At many universities, examination questions are usually composed by a question-setting group, and the papers are coordinated by senior subject teachers. The marking of the examinations is also carried out by all the teachers who teach the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated questions.
But in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and it is also necessary to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level, so that the test questions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types of questions.
Examinations are the driving force of university education, and whatever type of examinations there are, students will have corresponding study plans, which in the long run will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Rectorate of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values the students' letter of suggestion and has deployed a rectification plan across the whole school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations for self-inspection, formulate examination paper topics and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper topics and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
It is an issue that university examination affairs need to face to solve the problem of single type of questions and repeated questions from the mechanism, of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the kung fu lies in daily, teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, both sides understand, teachers and students will be better connected, forming a benign interaction, the exam will also be more in line with reality, so that "scholars" and "dunce" can get what they want.
If I cannot change the location of my store, can I switch to delivery instead?
Do I need to give any more money then?
The order from the colleague has been sent.
Can't pull it off.
What about GPS? Is it there or not?
Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nam-ro Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, we had to change the time twice because we didn't arrange the time properly, and the consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, a weekend with good weather was chosen for the shoot.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be her advisors, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
It was the first time I had ever done my makeup properly and wow, I couldn't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel too cold. While taking pictures, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and immediately help us fix it if anything was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after a day of taking pictures.
When selecting photos, I was hesitant to let the guests delete too many photos because I had seen many cases online, but when we were selecting photos, there was really no intention to add any photos, just the 24 photos in the package, not even one more (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos around the same time as me had a package of 7,000 and added more than 10,000 photos, I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many).
The photos were fixed today and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at them and found two that weren't quite right and they immediately helped me to fix them again.
Flipping through the photos my sister took before, I really felt satisfied with our photos. They were simple and refreshing, just the style I wanted.
I highly recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady to take wedding photos!
Suite Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful for all of you and wishes you all happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborns in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Bernama 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of the stock of special anti-counterfeit paper, birth certificates could not be issued to newborns since the beginning of October, with a cumulative total of 3,200 people affected so far.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kerem Amunus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and that the anti-counterfeit papers would be issued when they arrived next week.
At the press conference, he addressed a report by an online media that Sabah newspaper had been facing a paper printing issue for as long as 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of the special anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in its arrival in our country."
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kaluamunus revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was subsequently handed over to the printing company on 8th for partial printing work.
"The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be delivered to the applicant in two working days (December 20)."
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah had issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting since around 7 o'clock
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.

The Polish side hoped to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side in the field of sports.
Ji Ping stated that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in two months' time, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, presenting the world with a simple, safe and exciting event.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation in winter sports event preparation and athlete training between the two countries, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote deepening cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can "move forward together", and wishing the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina good results in Beijing.
Prior to the meeting, the BHOC held its 10th Annual Best Athlete Awards Ceremony, with Ji Ping as a special guest to present the award for Best Young Athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Beijing Winter Olympics promotional videos were playing on a loop at the event venue.

48-Hour Negative Nucleic Acid Test, Set Up "Buffer Zone" - The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in port cities recently, requiring people who have recently left port cities on land borders (except those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to port cities on land borders to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
Furthermore, the notice also proposed that eligible port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The relevant officials of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of differentiated management policies in different regions, from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to move the line of defense forward, compress the risk of spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above-mentioned notification pointed out that this exposed some problems such as local epidemic monitoring and early warning not being timely, high-risk personnel not implementing closed-loop management, regular nucleic acid testing being merely formal, cold chain items not being disinfected in all links, centralized isolation sites not being managed properly, and emergency response to the epidemic not being scientific and accurate.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the filling of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice stressed that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of people's livelihood security, publish and open up the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports of entry referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water and air ports are open, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities where they are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube Video Exposes US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing Truth - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war. After 20 years of fighting, bloodshed, and killing innocent people, various crimes against humanity have been committed.
The misuse of drones to launch airstrikes on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools distorts humanity and creates death squads.
Over the past 20 years, thousands of innocent Afghan civilians have been killed by US forces.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Each act of inhumanity stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" has become a "war of terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article which explains why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to do the canning, even though canning is a deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. Here is the text that may explain why the customer wants to do this:
I went to many manufacturers of milk powder and interacted with many production lines of milk powder.
Actually, the raw materials for bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a can is two years or longer?
Or, why is there such a big price difference between the tinned and bagged versions?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There were also consumers who ate with this mentality and then reacted afterwards saying that the taste or flavor of the packaged food was different!
Now I will explain to everyone why the hearing aid is expensive. Where is the expense?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Since most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low or even no profit, how can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a large increase in their listening fees to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for bulk packaging rather than bagged packaging.
And with so many manufacturers you think of, their annual advertising costs are in the tens of millions or even billions. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
As society develops, the costs of market promotion, such as mall promoters, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
So manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, and they are earphones, and their prices are also rising, in fact, these are new products that come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose was to gain higher profits, even though the cost of their raw materials would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to unscrupulous means and link up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per hearing.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that, on the premise of having a can at home, bagged milk powder should be put into the can, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food arrived late and was cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff #PRS_ORG# sent over must be cold by now.

Don't Scare People at the Starting Line - Xinhua
When visiting book markets, one often senses the popularity of books on success studies.
Many of the success books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the actually most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
It is for this reason that these books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best practice" is recognized as "right" by everyone who looks at it, but 99% of people are intimidated by it before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180-degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "You must change!" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to the rules, and resists change.
Most people are hesitant in the face of the word "transformation", reluctant to take action and make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and take the first step bravely, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" approach is that the bar is set too high, often beyond the capabilities of the average person, leaving the majority of people "looking on with envy".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that could lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages the theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
All in all, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes a greater chance of success.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In sum, while the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone to succeed, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "good enough principle" is more effective in motivating more people and benefiting as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 7,100 Tons This Year - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive human hunting and the deteriorating environment of the spawning grounds of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of China's Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passage".
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to purchase food over $180.
But the order was not discounted by $20.

The restaurant only gave me one bag to put it in and it was cold outside.
Is the take-out packed in one bag?
We only saw one bag.
Wondering if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about menstruation and it was too long.
Giving a crash course to the uninitiated males.
Most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, it will come regularly every month, provided that the body is in good health.
But it is not regular enough to be able to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so preparation needs to be done in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause it to flip (suddenly come several days earlier).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of cramping can vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they have to be taken away in an ambulance; cramps can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful ever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable and can last for several days with 24-hour bleeding, so the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the menstrual cycle can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but it is not effective if taken after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
Diarrhea is common before menstruation due to excessive uterine engorgement and prostaglandin release.
If it is around the time of your period, and you have sudden stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify here, the sanitary pad does not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once, the longest eight hours)
Hormonal influences during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation can also make one's mood unstable, which is really unfortunate as the body trips itself up.
However, official crime statistics show that women have a high capacity for controlling their emotions and are not likely to use emotional issues as an excuse.
What flows is not just blood, but also shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and it builds a house (the endometrium thickens) every month to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, with bleeding for several days and 24 hours a month for decades, as well as abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
But a person is born because his mother has menstruated, and menstruation is to prepare the house for you to stay in for 10 months when you first come to this world, so everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things for women were previously suppressed, and society brainwashed women to think that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting, finds the preparation of a female body for the creation of life disgusting, and says so in public, girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't understand it very well, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they really work.
It's disappointing that the gift arrived on the wrong day, especially since it's Winter Solstice today.
Ordering extra food for the children.
Hope the store will check the output amidst its busyness.
Is the foot bath basin tingling due to an electric shock?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a great therapeutic effect. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a variety of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the pen and it lit up, to his surprise he found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, who was quite accommodating, but Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied even though the foot bath was returned.
He discovered that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath tubs in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it is suitable for, and what materials are safe to use.
However, in general, foot baths are not likely to have any electrical issues, although there is no guarantee that some products may not have been inadequately checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a freestanding foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety risks.
You can also take a pen test at the same time.
13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
On the morning of December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Vice Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into "Five-Colored Tea of Xiang".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the trillion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colors Tea".
Tea industries in the province have increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea taking the lead. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving increased income for tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Newhua applauded the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
New-style red tea, with its infusion of tea culture connotations, is popular and in high demand, ushering in a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.
Is it possible to cancel if the food is not hot?
I declined, as there was no parking below and he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through the use of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called Tao, the below is called instrument" in the "Xi Ci Shang Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, and was translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions, etc.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only concepts.
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by naturalistic concepts, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any reference to God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and Monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and thinking about human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should follow), applied ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theory, but by investigating the actual moral agents' real choices made and observed, all the moral factors that led to these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Ethical Thought of Humanism, represented by such figures as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical Thought of the Reformation, Represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transitional Ethics (Non-Rationalist Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is the study of the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30-plus years since the passing of our beloved family member, especially since I first issued a humanitarian appeal in my own name in early 1994, which has been ongoing until now.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the deceased have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It was your act of kindness that helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you suspend the humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have been brought to a perfect conclusion long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and I am sure your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Student Societies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) over the past 32 years.
In the process of providing humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with the project executors often crossing over.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds, called "Tiananmen Mothers".
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund" and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans had graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects is mainly from campus and social donations from the year of 1989, from generous individual donations, and with the support of the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Research Foundation for Reformation of Prisoners.
Until last year, after a gap of 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June 4th.
During this period, China Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation was for the consideration of the donors, and we are indeed all retired people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding's "Letter to Friends" for this.
We will respect the decision of the beneficiaries to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
A special thanks and respect is due to those brave and generous colleagues who have been risking their lives for years to deliver humanitarian aid with their generous donations.

Thank you for choosing our product. Please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully before using our chip:
Please check that all items are present and correct upon opening the box.
If there is any missing, please contact customer service promptly.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a hand-pushed injector to directly sample the chip, as leakage may occur.
Standard base microfluidic chips are tested with pure water at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure prior to shipment.
Chips on glass substrates are tested with a sample inlet pressure of 800 mbar (100 um channel) in deionized water prior to shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using chips on glass substrates, otherwise the substrate may be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution when using and do not exceed the range, otherwise leakage will occur.
For the general-purpose base microfluidic chip, we suggest that the flow rate be set below 150ul/min when using pure water for injection pump, and the flow rate for the oil phase should be set below 50ul/min.
Please consider increasing your flow rate parameter values gradually from slow to fast, taking into account the viscosity of the actual sample liquid.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channels in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for long periods of time.
No exchange or refund will be made if the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation.

Thank you Rabbit for your review. Originally you said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan, your satisfaction can energize us to keep going, we will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great - I highly recommend it to all my friends!
There was no fault to be found in the reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography, and post-production.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match a makeup look suitable for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also all top-tier brands.
As for Teacher Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio had an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats playing around.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, it was just so-so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We have poor facial expression management, feeling that this is also the case for most people, and photographer Liang Ge will take pictures to record the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-oiled team.
We and the people around us were all praising it in unison.
My best friend has been recommended and she was equally delighted when she saw the proofs.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, more people will find them, take out their own style, instead of being the same.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
Sweet and caring assistants, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Thank you everyone for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Little Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust has been a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you. I'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play next time if I have the chance.
How do I pay?

No Rider Accepted
The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their personal experiences.
If one is planning to enter this industry, one can choose to find a place for training, but if there is no such idea, it is better to learn by oneself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, one should look at the faculty strength of the institution; if the faculty strength is not strong enough, then the training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions have not particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a selection, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, as only they can know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, I'm actually not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with the individual's own circumstances.
Such as profession, age, language to be learned, or even in which city, these will all be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, there are many offline and online training institutions, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I'm saying, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet for free, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
Additionally, there are some classic books that can be used in conjunction with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay for some learning costs and time, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
Those are my thoughts. As I said before, I don't know your situation so I can't give a detailed explanation. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said I'd be there before 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.
What is meant by
I wasn't finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of installation, cleaning, maintenance, wall-mounted stove, water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lighting, glass cleaning, professional tailoring, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me likes, striving hard for life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, so follow me if you like it, and thank those who silently give me likes.
That's life, others only see the results, while we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility; life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work as cleaners, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up from the customer, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My Daily Work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services helps you to do "clean" what I can, and serve the family with love.
Keep the environment clean, set up a model of good governance, provide quality service, and bring cleanliness home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Just like a crystal lamp, although gorgeous, will become dull without regular cleaning, and only after cleaning can it shine again, so is life.
With dedication to success and attention to detail, we are serious about sewing.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough out there in all industries right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persist and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!"
A day well begun is half done, all the good starts from the morning. May you start a new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something to have; when we grew up, happiness was a goal to reach; when we matured, we found that happiness was a state of mind to understand.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life to the fullest!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with equanimity.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese Curator Joins Hands to Hold Saudi Arabia's First Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News
The first Contemporary Art Biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial is co-curated by the Saudi Arabia-based Dhahran Biennial Foundation and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Of these, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly acclaimed, some of whom used recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Streams and Mountains" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Mr. Buckley, expressed his hope that this Biennial would establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain insight into the vibrant cultural and creative communities of Saudi Arabia and to strengthen the interaction between them.
Fei Yu said, "The biennial's goal is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period, with artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industries discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of employment assistance for people out of poverty, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help promote the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside.
According to the relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used to employ rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income through employment, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of post establishment, the new regulations clearly stipulate that post establishment should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "establishing posts according to needs, staffing posts according to posts, dynamic management, and overall control", "who establishes, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-job training and arrangement for taking up the post.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.

Second, although the right-wing has had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. They are short-lived because they shine brightly when given a bit of sunshine and sweat when given a bit of water; they are ambitious when they are successful and quickly submit when they are defeated.
But realistically, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and safeguarding human rights should not be denied.
Thirdly, while I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I do take his words seriously and I do respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes seriously the social issues in China.
But I opposed his anti-communist theory, I think that anti-necessity revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, those who seek to change or improve China must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the nation and its people. Those who seek political opportunism are not rightists, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists are actually a group of outcasts from the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I have recently seen some friends arguing with the anti-rebels while refuting the Leftists, and they were quite angry. I think there is no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the rebels and the left-wingers to admit it - why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a five-cent piece and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have dreams in their youth, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue them and become obsessed.
As ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth turns into an evil dragon.
I think "left and right" generally refers to constraint and freedom, and China, due to its historical and cultural innate genes, should generally be on the left side.
The right-wing domestically emphasizes freedom, efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness and security.
Now, there is a general social desire for greater fairness, and the Sino-US rivalry is certainly left-leaning, which is likely to continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a thumbs up and it's done.
Without saying a word, Flower was so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and containment of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US's suppression of China's chip industry, which requires its own companies and allied countries to block China's chip industry, has directly resulted in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phones becoming more expensive, with almost all industries that use chips being affected.
In order to gain control of the "chip" sovereignty, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and subsidizing US technology giants to regain their dominant position in the chip field. For example, Intel, an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up chip contract manufacturing business.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to snatch away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school tech giant in the US, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is sure to rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Morris Chang was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory. Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said that Intel's building of a chip foundry was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the semiconductor field was due to his lingering resentment towards Intel from a feud over 30 years ago with Taiwan Semiconductor.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of American manufacturing, dominating the global peak and the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chips designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model has been too burdensome for some small businesses, with many semiconductor start-ups facing prohibitively high costs for setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to specialize and cooperate in the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then it would be possible to set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
TSMC has focused its core business on the single process of "wafer fabrication" without design, providing only foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At the time, newly established TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognized that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
Surprisingly, the giants that once looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services are now starting to do semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel was entering the semiconductor foundry business.
Now, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's aggressive offensive, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
No more waiting.
I've been waiting for two hours since 19:06.
Let's take a look at some "Weird Hot Searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Raising its Head, Lay's Price Increase, and the Huolala Incident, public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [index decreased] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump appearing again.
They look identical to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was previously displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is anomalous sentiment?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, presenting a "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff" shape.
"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to get on the hot search list and attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating up to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with the time difference being almost zero, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite war, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-tuning operations, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, and without taking into account any subjective factors such as position or emotion, black PR will be nowhere to hide when looking at the objective data.
Everyone leaves a trace, and we will dig it out together.

Mauritius and Other Countries First to Discover Omikron Strain Infection Cases - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from Xinhua correspondents abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the OMKR strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omikron strain of the virus on the 10th.
According to Minister of Health Kailash Jugutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other is a local resident who tested positive for the virus on 30 November after having been in contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected persons both tested negative for nucleic acid, and have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the virus.

It was initially a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. At first my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as he arrived at the store.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even measure the house. They were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, and they showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam was that you would be dragged into paying a deposit as soon as you entered the store (and this money would never be refunded unless you had enough experience to fight them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This was a big scam and I was a living example of being duped, having paid a deposit of more than ten thousand in a moment of impulse.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major costs of the basic installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company for not making everything clear before having me sign the contract.
When I went to get my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with me.
No matter what, they will bite the bullet and take responsibility for the issue, even though it is not their fault.
There are all sorts of excuses and a lot of details that I don't want to go into, but in short, don't choose them because my friend's house that they renovated had poor quality and they charged him a lot of extra fees afterwards.
Damn it, they were the original scamming head decorations, now they changed to Da Mei, it seems like they closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shady decorating company.
In the future, everyone should do more research and consult these consultants when choosing, because decoration is not a small amount of money.
Please log in or register to ask a merchant a question.
No merchant reviews of any kind are allowed; please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel this conversation, if you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within less than 15 minutes.

Starry Night Rendezvous | Gemini Meteor Shower to Reach Peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
The Gemini Meteor Shower photographed by Beijing Astronomy Enthusiast Anjiu on December 13th, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not to be "nurtured" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical popularization, said that just like the New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and its "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of activity, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantids and the Perseids.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies are slow, colorful, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
The Gemini Meteor Shower photographed by Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13th, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Geminids meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant at the zenith) of 150.
Chart of the Recommended Index for the Gemini Meteor Shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression with its "falling petals", but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, so the spectacle will be slightly discounted.
On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, with a full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but rather to choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets to observe visually."
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so it is not necessary to keep looking at the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries and shutter release cables are also essential for stability and continuity considerations.
Xiu Li Peng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television referred to by the questioner should be the LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the broad market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhiyi-Kang's forecast, the sales of laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The success of the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sichuan Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
In the current era of increasing emphasis on visual health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the prices of LCD TVs which are constantly dropping, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
That makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, laser TVs have a shorter projection distance than traditional projection equipment, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, with a small space requirement and a compact host, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less wear and tear on the equipment, and longer life of the television.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, etc., which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a matter of pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account both the large screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge for yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle short-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, a micro-structured Fybril screen was used, at a high cost; the price of an 80-inch was basically enough to buy a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I really hate it when projector manufacturers use "good for your eyes" as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen is direct light to the eyes. You can diffuse it to the ceiling, but the eyes still can't see it. LCD TVs are also direct "light", when you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling lit up too?
Moreover, if the projection screen fabric is not diffuse, it will not be able to form an image.
It was precisely the hot spot (glare) effect of the high gain screen that was overlooked, where a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes at certain angles, that was really uncomfortable.

After I added her on WeChat to book a date, the lady sent me the available times, and she replied to my messages quite promptly.
Before going, I looked at the studio's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props and guide the action before shooting, and be very meticulous about every detail.
But maybe because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-production style, which feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the piece, waiting for the effect~
I won the second round of the photography-themed Bawang Meal event~ most of the clothes in the store could be chosen for a photoshoot.
She finally chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer was my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He felt a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He was quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.

Let's go to the homepage and check out Queenie too!
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose the clothes. Wedding dresses were also available. I tried on three or four sets and they were very patient. After choosing, I spent a long time doing makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, the photographer will teach you how to pose. It just feels like the face is too big in the photos. They said it would take half a month to retouch, but they sent it to me in three or four days. It feels like there is no difference from the original.
The environment is overall good.
There are lots of clothes to choose from.
There are approximately three makeup positions and a photography studio inside.
Service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the poses seriously.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
Experience: The eyelid shape may have been overdone, originally double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
My eyebrows were also shaved off, which was a bit embarrassing for daily life without eyebrows.
The photos were given in about ten days, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what style to go for, I tried on two sets, but in the end I chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After picking out the clothes, I started to get my hair and makeup done. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The end result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and the little brother said he would finish the film within 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfactory~
It has been 3 days since I have not received a response...I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan as your system is unable to recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you can collect my monthly fee after you have investigated? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the Suggestions on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015), three key words must be met in order to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million for establishment, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent, and can be summarized as having the strength, being approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) for regulating insurance companies and banks, having good shareholder style, and as an insurance broker, the insured does not need to question too much whether the umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it is good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of business outlets and the cost of business personnel salaries, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still pretty good.
It can be considered.
In terms of professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can lead to many potential claims issues and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Weibao" (like Little Umbrella, an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The internet insurance is real and reliable, but what is not reliable are the people. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is Need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years, they don't know what they bought.
Insurer pays out 6 million (world's luckiest) for a 1 dollar bet.
The free mobile phone was only given to policyholders with special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message was sent out, no one would remind them if they did not redeem it.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) The free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term, and if there is no other commercial insurance, if a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 can't do anything, can't solve the problem, and life will start to go barefoot.
Misleading practices in the sale of internet insurance are currently being rigorously addressed by the state.
So, all in all, the platform is fine, the product is fine, it's the professionalism and ethical conduct of the salesperson that is the issue.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully, as many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, more choices and opportunities for customers, and some of their products have better cost-effectiveness than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers be worry-free.
Growing with each customer for life.
I hope my answer was helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory body, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, neither the policyholder nor the insurance advisor needs to sign, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there may be no "ceremony" to the purchase of an online insurance policy, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat akin to a "telephone sales" assembly line approach, has the potential fatal flaw of not being able to keep up with the follow-up service.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and choose an "intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even many years later?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to be a compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider just left it at the door and then the person left.

Redeeming the discount code
No problem, remember no need to arrange for reshipment, I have already bought another one, don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate anything, but this kind of villainy must be stopped.
If we set aside party and faction, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, followed by posts with a mocking tone, to your attempt to post what you claimed to be my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
Not only did you continue to tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but you also continued to make subtle, humiliating comments about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body, good upbringing, and whether or not I should plant strawberries in bed, etc. I...just let it go.
Subsequently, I received messages from several friends informing me of a photo of you and a sexually harassing comment uploaded to your Facebook account.
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news of the complaint was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, there needs to be respect for both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your making of the picture or continue to make all the offensive statements.
Yes, I cannot, and do not have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my looks and figure do not need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself like that in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it, and you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those without basic decency would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the free.
I have taken excerpts of the messages for everyone to consider.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent yourself.
I can only say you are a civilized public enemy.
A smile of satisfaction
Vietnam People's Net - Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major meetings were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics revolving around the two main themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has seen a significant increase in the number of digital products cultivated to address the major challenges facing the country, with many digital products having gone global and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology having improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take on the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and to take on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies, shared mobilization and gathering of all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, Zhu Hui's breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the epidemic, etc.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for all, so it is necessary to mobilize all to participate.
People and businesses are at the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, and should be mainly driven by internal forces, with strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believed that digital transformation should drive deeper and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, response to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help green transformation and development of green energy.
Digital transformation should involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote data related to national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and practices, and the promotion of digital transformation in the banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics sectors.
The main goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the nation increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has called for governments at all levels, organs at all levels, and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems for digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and actively promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, and positivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 Vietnam Manufacturing Excellence Digital Product Awards Ceremony and the opening of the Vietnam Manufacturing Digital Product Exhibition.

What is the best model of Balihan?
#1 of 500ML 42° Ningcheng Balihan Old Cellar Strong Aroma Sorghum Original Juice White Wine, Smooth and Mellow Old Wine, 4 Bottles Per Box

This is the second water green comprehensive service zone in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan was officially put into operation on the 8th.
With this, the Water-Green Comprehensive Service Zone has now covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Maritime Administration, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by the majority of the sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

US Three-Carrier Strike Group Gathers Around China, Rare Visit to Guam by Most Powerful Weapon in US Arsenal - DOWJONES, January 17, 2021 - DOWJONES, a pro-China media outlet, reported the latest news on US-China relations: Latest satellite images show three US aircraft carriers gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of the Chinese think tank, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9th.
The Balabac Strait, connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy the "Carl Vinson" to the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier onboard.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy carrier currently cruising in the Pacific is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried its first F-35C squadron, the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing three US aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Carriers Gather Around China, Rare Visit to Guam by Most Powerful Weapon - CMV-22B Flight Route on January 17, 2022.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence.
The USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, with the strongest weapon making a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US Three-Carrier Strike Group Gathers Around China; Most Powerful Weapon Makes Rare Visit to Guam; China has been building up a large number of military facilities in the Paracel Islands in recent years.

In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine, the USS Nevada, to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rumbling Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomers" the "most important survivable leg of the nuclear triad", which also includes launch silos for ballistic missiles located on US soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
What is the reason behind the recent 26% drop in Meta, resulting in a market value loss of $251 billion, to which Mark Zuckerberg responded by saying that they are "facing unprecedented competition"?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its revenue primarily coming from advertising. Today, advertising companies make money by having their own channels of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, whatever the functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "Ad Network", with many apps integrating Meta's ads to monetize through Meta's ad platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, with a clear prompt to users as to whether they allow an app to access their information, with most people's natural reaction being to deny it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of which is uncertain, but it is there).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies doing business in the sea.
Meta has approximately hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in Mainland China.
Chinese companies wanting to expand into overseas markets find Meta an unavoidable advertising channel, burning most of their money on Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money off of Byte in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels was not successful.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest issue is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets look not only at current income but also at future expectations.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were not met.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization of the Metaverse has a longer cycle, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of between $100 and $200 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis at Facebook, with no real safe haven compared to other internet and high-tech companies.
Although his several social media apps now have a high daily active user base and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand unified universe, which is out of reach in the short term, is very risky for Facebook, which is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues, but I think his choice of avenues was wrong and it was a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for your reference.
