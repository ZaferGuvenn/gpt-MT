The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find this honestly very annoying.
Do I need to cancel and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I believe it is also beneficial for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Quickly looking, quickly helping, bringing the bottle, etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can occupy itself for a short time and it is okay for him, then that is good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is likely questionable.
Perhaps that is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to happen such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows what it is...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken on by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain to suppress an anxiety center and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
One woman jumped out of the window and another deliberately drove herself to death.
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That is the general plot, I am fairly certain that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the WiFi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That can take some time.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Four year old child with a splinter under the thumbnail.
A four year old child has a wood splinter embedded under the thumbnail (outer side).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron, Johnson will drive forward the refreshment.
New cases of Omikron are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year's, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing Omikron figures than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that they are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so it is urgent to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation arrived by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Could someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should be familiar with pronouns.
I have a total of five books.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Evidently, the chair had an undisclosed defect at the time of sale.
How else could such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First attempted on #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about.
Not more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
The feeling of helplessness.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to my profession.
One issue that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach them all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
I often wish I could help in every situation... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, and an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg suffer a derby disaster against the Merlins Crailsheim.
Youngster Johannes Patrick could always be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, the disappointment did not subside after the game, but rather increased after the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the bare result, the manner of the performance was disappointing.
As an example, here is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point percentage was only 13%, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "We were just not focused enough after our win at Teneriffa and did not implement what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim, his counterpart, reacted differently: "It's great to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like performing in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised.
While Patrick's team's top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.

Always looking dapper: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had intended to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by government order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with enthusiasm since he was a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and an emphasis on etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Luck", he has been on tour since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It should be supplemented with existing furniture so that we can check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working; I can only see the cover but can't flip through the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new housing will be created through expropriation.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No new housing is created through expropriation, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.

Thank you for the quick resolution!
How long will the shipping take if the lamp is shipped in March?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 deaths due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to move through the United States.
More than 100 deaths could be reported in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, potentially claiming up to one hundred lives.
The storms leave a roughly 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, primarily in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through was gone.
Houses, stores, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hi, I just noticed that you have sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
Do I understand correctly that I can now order the ceiling and have it shipped to Germany that is in my shopping cart?
I had returned an item through the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are offering vaccine incentives and changing their slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This aligns with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Following the German example, the re-purposing of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination is intended to increase the willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I am taking a screenshot.

Assistance with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is set, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where further action should develop.
A group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero a few miles away from the village, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Acting, Threatening, Recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 regular Goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the hero in a hollow way, flanking the wagon with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
How appropriate do you consider the Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of a commitment to start the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Through the combination of the TEM Concept (Processes), world-class TEM technology (Tools) and the expertise of TEM specialists (People), Convergence usually achieves a reduction in expenses of 20-40% from a full lifecycle TTEM initiative, usually without changing providers.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
Put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then have the receipts come in, then I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello F1 fans, throughout the season the quality of German Sky has been decreasing, so I wanted to vent a bit with this post.
Initially, the transmission was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the start delay and accident set the schedule far behind the plan, they could have still shown the last ten minutes (as planned) and the championship decision (!) in the end.
Apparently, due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite being foolish, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to its conclusion.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag in F1.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties in the rules topic.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But I honestly prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
Additionally, there are constant antics that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Lastly, Sky simply takes over with advertising, as Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising during the cool-down lap, as can be heard on F1TV as it has to rely on the German audio track without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
While I must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sports F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
So, in any case, the great F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
One #PRS_ORG# Pendant Light, Brass and Multi-Colored Glass.
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still has not been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am requesting assistance.
Air pumps are an excellent way to provide additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
For larger aquariums, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that multiple outlets can be connected.
The MK Series has one, two, or four outputs depending on the model, but fan pumps can also be used to add an accent to the aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar should be mentioned.
The MK Series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an emitter or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then it's ready to go.
The water pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the pump for the fan is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, so that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to be proactive so that no one gets upset if something takes a bit longer.
It is like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course here, no Corona stops.
Please do not judge us harshly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the package services.
We often complain about these services, even though we have to admit...they have it really tough right now.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can I also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers took a short trip to outer space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers slowly emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley, the 74-year-old daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley reflected on her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his assignments.
She just went along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would most like to go back to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule that was separated from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was decelerated by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary to outer space, however there is no binding international regulation.
This was Blue Origin's third manned space mission: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's Deputy Chief, Audrey Powers, were present.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in one color or cycle through its entire range of colors.

Someone who works in or studies biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind the lab work (I already have the inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
Before I started my studies, I had already done research on career prospects, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until I got my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On one hand, you often hear about great job opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, but on the other hand, you also hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working on?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what qualifications do you have?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your responses!
I am currently uncertain and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down!
Increased Stress Before Holiday and Weekend Breaks
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax and unwind.
That's why I'm posting about it now.
Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, is there a lot of stress in our workplace.
It seems that there are also days off before holidays and bridge days.
Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Fridays, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress Everywhere.
A flurry of emails that had to be sent out before the deadline, orders here and there, all *urgently* needing to be done before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like too much time has passed and that cannot be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed hostage situation due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know this in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home, but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
"Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just take a trip to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said Hit Radio FFH actress and singer.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the festive days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird keeping is exclusively caused by nutritional errors.
Since feathers are composed of protein-rich substances, a rich and balanced protein diet is necessary for the formation of a perfect feather coat for the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the feather loss that occurs during molting is due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
This DDR handcrafted model of the old E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR was used in Silesia and Central Germany and is very rare, likely originating from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway ME Magazine 11/1968. It is used with signs of play and missing parts, as seen in the photos, and functions well. The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, and the kit may also originate from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG torsion bar drive, with AEG supplying the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke supplying the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, receiving the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived World War II and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Dessau Railway Repair Works, the refurbishment eligibility of all six locomotives was determined.
As the re-electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increased demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 which were available in larger quantities were favored for assembly.
Once it became apparent that the recovery rate of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus for recovery.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives aged, the complex control became increasingly problematic.
It was often observed that switches would stick during switching operations.
Then the fireman who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings while the train was in motion.
Damage to the locomotive engines was frequent, leading to months of downtime for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last of them, the E 95 01, was decommissioned on October 5th, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives have been dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is preserved in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P heritage community have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, with the transformers checked and five traction motors operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their low maintenance requirements and efficient drive.
In February 1945, the machines were rehomed to the Central German Network in Leipzig.
Initially, the main area of deployment was Silesia.
Handcrafted H0 model in original packaging, functioning well, optical work on the locomotive is necessary to be done by the owner, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and inventory marks.
Yes, the F-Parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were issues with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, which unfortunately have been produced with errors.
The center bar does not fit into the designated holder.
I also get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No flat rates.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
As long as it serves its purpose
They are not flat with me.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage.
Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to reports, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Police have taken over the further investigations.
That will arrive much later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
False information circulated on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
For the past few months, friends have been pushing me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
Şahin further wrote that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am legally not allowed to get the vaccine myself right now," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccine distribution in Germany.
Now the prioritization has been lifted - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power.
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had knocked out a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in multiple municipalities were affected when the power went out.
Supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support to the communities.
The authorities provided childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical malfunction caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work required there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
As of 11:15 PM, those affected by the outage would have electricity again.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, according to authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those who cannot provide for themselves or need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
This is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I cannot mount the bracket underneath the tabletop.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I am unable to nest and shorten it.
Can you help me further with that?
Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that really is easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both have done it anew and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
What now that the chat connection is gone?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean paint job, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry off.
Before you apply the brush with a new paint to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of components that won't be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first cut on the component.
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers will later create a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark colors could otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when mixed with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or transfer stickers.
From aircraft markings to ship names, to trim and badges on car models, decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily decaled before it is installed into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when sticking is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also known as water-slide decals because you briefly wet the back with water until the backing paper darkens with the moisture.
Then you slide the image just a little bit away from the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Caution: Always check to make sure the picture is properly aligned before sliding it completely off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book for a short time, and once I look away I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place I was up to.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Does this apply to all three packages?
Because the lamp arrived in three separate packages for me.
Thank you very much anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been undergoing fertility treatments for some time, but now when it comes to billing the private health insurance, they are suddenly refusing to pay.
Sequentially:
We had applied for the fertility treatment with the private health insurance in advance and were granted approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet file a claim with the private health insurance.
We requested reimbursement from the PKV again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course billing the most expensive to the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The rationale: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first offer expire.
The second wish is for a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the room here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Should the health insurance have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
OK.
We will not be ordering anything from you anymore.
If you add together my and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) sales, you obviously have lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund had been processed, and now you're telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please refer to the screenshot to see what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the refund was initiated and I have still not received a refund from #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, a 24-month warranty is provided.
No, I am not able to procure a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, however, we are unable to find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no universal definition of what exactly constitutes a low-budget film, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A low-budget film or movie is a motion picture produced with minimal or no financial support from a major film studio or individual investor.
On the internet, one can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
What don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I would like to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
Has the delivery time been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you.
Best regards
If there is no phone number, no chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Half Victory Against Belarus Comes at High Cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and have resulted in massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, according to the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion of the Union at the same time.
"She apparently cannot prevail if a Member State sets its mind to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays an additional price for its policy at the Belarus border, according to Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to Cross the Boundary Again
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesperson for the agency on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to reports, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
In total, Border Patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of Minsk of luring people with the promise of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Additionally, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
Bossong said that the most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines.
The EU has thrown its weight around and demonstrated its resolve to operate with an iron fist and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
Mercedes believes that Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest refers to an alleged breach of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have illegally overtaken.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
On the last lap, Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'm checking on that.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting a SC Freiburg fan day.
Europa-Park, namesake of the SC Freiburg Stadium, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white that day by the jerseys.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in existence since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg fan event at Europa-Park, the partnership was again demonstrated to be a great fit.
Seeing the delighted guests having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original 1699€?

Just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfDler saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it completely.
Yes, wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution of the fundamentals is completely lost.
A god has set this whole thing in motion for me.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
With that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain the best field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows for practically distortion- and color-error free use of the magnifying glass even in the edge zone.
Magnifying lenses are often labeled with magnification ratings.
However, these figures only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to actual usage conditions.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please refer to the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
When used under optimal conditions - lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz community are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on something.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them for that purpose.
The 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer?!
I have received a defective shipment and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to debate which dish is better here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have thus earned their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "the twister," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Issues with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan which received and transmitted 50 Mbps perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other DLan module which emits the wifi, not the full 500 come through, but the further away I am in the house from the module, the less comes through (so using a socket which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This has resulted in the internet with the new fiber connection now being slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost over the power line when using fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to run LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch checking accounts.
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, they are mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She has now halved the allowance and even quartered it for the current account.
Initially, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Now, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
Not just for new contracts, but also for "newly negotiated individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, especially among cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer protection agencies, who in the first instance were successful in their case against this regulation at the Berlin District Court.
Banks are now discussing whether they should set aside reserves in case higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Yet their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of their appearance.
Nevertheless, as Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
That their hearts still fly to both female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and is still searching for true love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people asking don't have any idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It really hurt.
It is to be hoped that success and fame bring happiness.
Unfortunate End to a Career: Räikkönen Forced to Retire
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barriers, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport's premier class.
For his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bobsled - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he made a change to the material setting and on Sunday pulled out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat out the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously placing second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka
At the women's event, Laura Nolte achieved her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in a German triple success.
Two-time bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get a podium finish in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama took me along.
I am super happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential to be had, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just about pushing off, there is also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not quite flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked about it.
Last year due to the coronavirus, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
Now he said it had expired which made me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then reorder it since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
It was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls and women!
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is essentially my child one-to-one.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also under the weather and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having tummy troubles, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket, having relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and some petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we have to do homework too, which we obviously have to divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well managed, I am receiving adequate therapy and am coping.
Not great, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me; I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and I should at least prepare a bit for my anatomy class the day after tomorrow.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what happens next?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on and on.
I think I'm just so overwhelmed right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams without it.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry, so I thought I could find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as it appeared on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
Moreover, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back in school, I noticed that many religious studies teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it has always been strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I have always somehow believed it.
What is your opinion on this?
You can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between personal and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the Theory of Relativity.
What would motivate someone to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Maintaining culture or something like that?
I hope this question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I understand English well, so feel free to write in English.
I would advise against that, it's been too long.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response promptly, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie.
Hello everyone,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman, whom I cannot describe further in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to gain life for himself.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If this means anything to you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy since week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly toys, go in and check more often but don't monitor every minute.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No cushions.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, just a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten itself out from the stomach?
Or is it face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is alright.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to put babies to sleep on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already a "loyal customer" of yours and have purchased many items already.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I emailed one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
This is regarding my wardrobe that arrived two days ago (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I kindly request that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now worse than ever.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno said, "We don't want to be a billboard."
What are we now?
A generic advertising channel trying to push its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
This applies to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
Krogmann, who lacks empathy completely, is trying to make a profit at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is one supposed to make sense of all this?
Great if you like it, I find it awful.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling, my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft fabric makes the application especially comfortable, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable for use as a heat pad for the following applications only:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mildew, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming before taking it out of the cover!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On the first heating cycles, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions provided, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating a pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your inner arm!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores are exposed, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and in a manner inaccessible to children.
When the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please refer to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt Second After Half-Time - Pauli Wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charging through my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up even with the power adapter plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20 liter capacity easily swallows larger photo gear, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, they stay well organized and separate from your photography equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is now presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design packs a punch - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still granting quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an ingeniously designed solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack located in the flap closure.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is heavily loaded, take the top bar, if it is lighter, take a lower one.
The clasp and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also sets the Everyday Backpack apart from other camera backpacks: in addition to the top flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest downside of traditional top-loading backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: when you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior space (more on that below) to easily store items separately and access them independently through the two side openings.
Additionally, you can pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while keeping your everyday items safely in the left half of the backpack and out of the way.
Convenient, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the exterior of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're headed to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for an email from your support team.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company has announced contact to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I have not received any news yet.
I request immediate settlement.
I am now on my third support staff member and none of them have been able to do more than promise me an email confirmation.
This is for the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it possible to predict when the cabinet will be delivered?
Keeping it this way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged furniture piece and did not return it.
I could not have foreseen that last year would have gone differently than expected, and thus I was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will be searching for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and setting up businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneering peers in order to not go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions or turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will get a lock-in!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the potential actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the bidder rotates to a new location, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the bidder has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, parcel (games wrapped) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually DPD insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in paper and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship the box in a box for an additional cost of 2 euros, so that there is 100% no pressure points.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, and abuse of power by CW.
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, so I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Becoming Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
To us parents and other responsible adults, it must never, ever, ever be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible, as is sensible and possible in the situation.
I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries Discussing Removal of Testing Requirement for Fully Vaccinated People
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We need clarity quickly from the countries on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
Minister Holetschek said that the elimination of the 2G plus vaccine for those who have received three doses is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination".
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference on Tuesday next week. − afp

What you are describing is referred to as "Awareness," which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided until the baby is detached in order to protect it.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
Awareness is the understanding of a situation or a fact.
I misread your comment.
However, the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the broken chair.
This is standard practice in eCommerce, in addition to legal requirements.
Please check again if you can at least take back the broken chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
Through the combination of the TEM Concept (Process), world class TEM technology (Tools) and TEM specialist (People) experience, Convergence typically achieves 20% to 40% of expense reductions from full lifecycle TTEM initiatives, most often without changing operators.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had posed a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has passed away at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an impresario.
He later wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle up until April 2021.
In the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has passed away.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I give thanks for my life here and now".
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardized wooden pallet used mainly in Europe as a cargo carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.

In the Eastern Conference Finals, New York prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
For Christmas, there was something incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thank you again for that.
Now I'm hooked and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, only a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I can manage this.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
However, the money has not yet arrived to me.
Please check there.
Where to find Christmas roast in Lübeck.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Additionally, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, allowing you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
It was mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a power reserve when it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This incoming signal is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an extremely "acoustic" sound impression.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live deployment.
VOX is taking another step into the future with its new power packages!
I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Why is it hanging too low over the dining table?
I would like to return them then.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or coupon.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Spending over 1,000 euros on something I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement.
Iranian officials have reported progress in negotiations for the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" as there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated at first.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest coronavirus incidence rate in Germany.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only state, the value is above 1000.
Thuringia was the only state in Germany to have a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate in the country, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive medical treatment in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
Furthermore, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery is scheduled for early March, it may be possible by then.
I need to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, is that it?
No further action is required.
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping at my own expense.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It is time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
Looking at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have entered a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull to a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
This is largely due to dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and our overall standing.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here still have a real desire for the Bundestag.
What we need to change
Here, the community around the Bundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have come together who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to take this opportunity to call on everyone to participate, as only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Verbesserung der Kundenzufriedenheit
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord for that at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
Do you have the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in an oversized size, such as 240/240, as well?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I do not have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I used to think that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was becoming disgruntled, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, she was reducing animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I am quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, I cannot be present due to a funeral, so that cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
Starting February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner Wehr Prepared for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new rescue boat of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, Mayor of Lahnstein.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one can expect a continuous increase in activity: the boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel rivers, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of before the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but nothing worked when I synced, removed, and re-downloaded the app.
I am somewhat frustrated because this whole process has already taken me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into any more detail than that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally speaking, it should be said that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people are naturally drawn to uniforms and weapons on the right side of the political spectrum, and it is also clear that these people can have difficulty dealing with reality. In addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these marginalized groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience take a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to make them right, while they just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, since police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme rights there, but it is completely exaggerated by the media that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have been deployed abroad often start to generalize and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-minded comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well fought and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined that, in my opinion, we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
I'm still inquiring about my order that is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black be delivered to Germany, or is this basket available anywhere in Germany?
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Neatly through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with something for a while now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-sufficient, very little free time), but I have struggled to keep my household clean and organized for most of my life.
There are always times when everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's never really the case that someone could just drop by spontaneously.
My husband is not any better either, it bothers me somewhere but usually household tasks just lose out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with the children?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
For me, I don't have much motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as there is no visitors and for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child motivate you to be more organized or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut provides maximum comfort, perfect fit, and almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends).
The Focea Comfort 4 has been more than doubled in the Flex System 2 to further increase comfort, covering the area covered by the Flex System.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows, and knees).
High quality pre-shaping in the lower back and crotch area provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending and donning and doffing equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (2mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle hook and loop fastener which does not adhere to the lamination or seams.
Zipper cuffs at the arm and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, camouflaged neoprene outer cuff.
45 degree notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at both ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for increased durability.
Notches on the inner cuffs for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the dive computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been out of apprenticeship for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The Problem: I have an insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I am not sure if the actual day-to-day work is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have these issues in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please!
If I have downloaded a book onto my #PRS_ORG#, I get the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book."
Are there any issues?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its digestive tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and then builds its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in nestlings and moulting in adult birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

One gram of NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level scoop (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the regrowth of feathers is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but this chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the statute.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree needs to be cut down on our property.
A request for a felling permit has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee has written to me that felling fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the ordinance.
However, the walnut tree is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected in the charter.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On one hand, I need to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket shipped to Germany.
Can you verify that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb.
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on State Road 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03 hrs), a car has crossed into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life.
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... In short, I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a cross-entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field as well (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I am now on my third "googling other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to keep going and finish at least the ref, after which I can always switch.
But right now I'm completely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Even though it's vacation time, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moment.
Now even family gatherings are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like Ref is doing well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now, feeling dissatisfied again.
You can tell it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe as an outsider you have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views can help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely cutting-edge in terms of sound.
Thanks to the Virtual Element Technology (VET) which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partially based on real analog circuits, as they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system, from which natural resonances just pour out.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly how you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined multiple times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers shone, but it wasn't enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable hook and loop dividers, it can be tailored to your photography equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an attachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those with a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is the end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There is no reliable data available on past outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damages.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree Celsius lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, with damages estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas of approximately 50 hectares in total were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it, was particularly hard hit, even before the volcanic eruption it was already in crisis.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is just around the corner and the children will be eagerly awaiting the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is even more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Santa Claus Became the Christmas Spirit
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
In the past, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, had thrown gold secretly into the windows of three women in one night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the popular German custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and humans.
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin processions, is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all countries with a Christian influence, there is a cheerful confusion about who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is said that the witch Befana showed them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has achieved some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
On Saturday, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police near Kensington Palace in London.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light is easy to set up and can be anchored to the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination time of 10 hours.
The robust plastic design is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The seamless, amorphous design is intentional: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to hold his own due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work upfront: Smart Stone does not require wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "lighthouse" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide secure anchoring when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" automatically lights up; you decide the color: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
The shutdown also occurs automatically once the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts over the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it does not work.
I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved significantly again.
An adjustable PWM frequency ranging from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation, especially for bell-armature motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
Load control can now be adjusted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough to power even older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I was forced to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave this as it is, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
Surprisingly, my main problem is not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive breakout of acne from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and it was all over my body.
On the surface it seemed okay, but it weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two year break, things never really returned to normal.
Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid this this time?
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and I still have an appointment with the dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have tried all sorts of diets in relation to chronic illness and have settled on a mix of low sugar, low dairy and low meat as nothing else seemed to work properly.
It may also be the case that hormones are simply out of balance, but if one has issues everywhere like I do, one would rather not search for what else could be wrong.
I had already given everything to your colleague Semina or similar.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I was working in between and answering the phone and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.
But is it generally available in large quantities?
Since it is widely available in black.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments.
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
Yet much depends on their judgment, even though they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them, Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach, spoke to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court. They are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the John F. Kennedy Street District Court.
Hello, unfortunately I am unable to log into my customer account.
Could you please resend me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way to keep them for this long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
I had already ordered and received the same chair in blue in November, so I would now like to order one in grey because they are so nice.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pick-up and refund?
When would the pickup be?
A 110 kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's approval of the plan clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about it, I already explained that multiple times yesterday!
This is a glass dresser and the entire sides have shattered, leaving glass everywhere and the box is destroyed.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 Euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the same for all books, which is why the inquiry was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it appears to be a general problem.
Planning lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I have been teaching in the Ref since summer and I enjoy it, but I am currently having a lot of difficulty planning my geography lessons in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I am currently needing a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on geofactors and for me, every hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need time for other activities).
When I plan, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with the book Terra and most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
Retailers are worried about the 2G regulations for the Christmas season.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed in most stores.
Trading considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Stefan Genth, CEO of HDE, criticized that businesses dealing with non-daily needs items have seen a decrease in sales.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had written off the Christmas business already.
"What should have been the high point of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Only the grocery and online retail sectors are performing well.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
The Chief Executive Officer said that shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe affair.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel involvement.
He demanded that the band regulation should be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet they received.
Furthermore, in retail, as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas season.
The frequencies were last at around 75% of pre-Corona levels without 2G, with revenues at around 90%.
These figures are now sure to drop in the midst of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the Centers.
This includes the so-called bracelet solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which has been attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat high power SMD LEDs with high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is its ease of use and intuitive operation.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high quality light, completely free of flicker.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
This also applies to reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the package).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons to assign and complete.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with economical NP-F batteries.
This is often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery power before setting up - it has a built-in battery tester - with a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Additionally, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight with the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, allowing you to directly attach to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using stops on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, an articulating joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any issues.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Scoring a Comeback Against Leverkusen
What an incredible reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had previously gone two games without a win, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned it up, shooting off their frustration over a mixed season start in a good hour and winning furiously with 5:2. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to everyone who was involved".
Initially, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who were still behind their expectations at ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players then came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular delight for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players are also living a highly professional lifestyle.
Now we want to "go step by step and stay humble" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the end of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6:30 PM, Sky).
I just received an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would mean for me that I won't order again because it already took very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for Women's Handball Ahead of Quarter-Final Against Spain
Germany's female handball team walked off the court with their heads hung low and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Championship, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We must present ourselves differently against Spain.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points, behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from all of us that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to make it to the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start of the match.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to make an impression - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was effectively over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke was soon after shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game better and at least came within five goals of the score by halftime.
The faint hope of a comeback after the switch was gone after seven minutes when the score was 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is counted among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions During the Christmas Season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have secured the day of St. Nicholas and are taking this opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at your home back then?
How about with your partner?
Do you want to pass your traditions on to your children?
What is the best thing for the children?
Shoe shining?
Baking cookies?
Decorating a tree?
Is music being played?
Is the Christmas gift from Santa, the Christ Child, or from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone puts in effort to make it as nice as possible as a family around and during Christmas.
Whether it's a fixed tradition or something different every year, tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number or something else that could help.
Payment Confirmation... etc.
I would like to give a voucher code as a gift.
As with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers.
Does that work for you?
The title states it, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely completed, it will then continue for me in part to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, will that be compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include educating on the vaccine, determining eligibility (person is eligible for a vaccine according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Order and has no contraindications), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any medical personnel, but "only" (by no means with any lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not allowed to carry out vaccinations, so I usually carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Tough "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused intense contemplation in the Bavarian Broadcasting (BR) television show "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike many previous days, the term remained unguessed by the callers in the "Host mi?" series this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
Nor anyone who needs everything to be done quickly.
What the people heard from the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg shared the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that the "huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe out the oven.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
Noting that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap, even for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG# device with the PC.
Nothing has helped.
Is tire selection for road racing really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what usually lurks in every city center happened (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, a loud hissing and my rear tire was not willing to go any further on the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
Weather-wise it wasn't too bad, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days, I would really not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
Now it wasn't really bad, since the previous owner's tires (very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) were already labeled as suboptimal, since he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
When I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of driving, I'm probably going to be in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, this all sounds very appealing.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire only to be disappointed in the end.
I'm also wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my road bike right now.
There are Marathon Plus tires that appear to be this size, but most are wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD based on my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a specially designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
By design, the SOLO 15 is well suited for people who prioritize sound quality over maximum volume, aiming for an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels nearly unfiltered.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight high-end boost.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Precisely tailored to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By slightly turning the treble down, the high frequency range can be reduced and the sound can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of each component of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-grade extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary modifications during the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the cutout for the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), one should first drill an 8mm hole in the bottom board at the corresponding location in order to be able to run the cable through it later without any problems.
Using an overhead router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM will receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
Afterwards, one begins to construct the box by placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16mm MDF.
The second side is then applied in the next step.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, including both sides and the front.
Using an appropriate hole saw or Forstner bit makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round mill is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The mounting points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block are then marked and pre-drilled (2.5 mm drill bit).
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blowing out), the laying of the cable begins.
This is most easily achieved through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
Push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30cm of cable sticking out.
At the top of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
The crossover is then prepared and installed.
The crossover design and corresponding wiring diagram can be found in the following document: Solo 15 Crossover Assembly Manual.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
By using the 35mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, hot glue can be dropped onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the corresponding screws.
Polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone!
Finally, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant an increased planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we will be able to watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get the drinks chilled, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
