The reason I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has stated some reasons for his departure from the PDP to the APC.
This week, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, defected from the PDP to the APC.
Dogara said that he should stay and enjoy the support of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State to help the masses win the 2019 election, but he should gather and leave the party to go back to the APC.
The main reason I left for Bauchi State was because of the PDP's rule.
I took part in the gubernatorial election in which the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, defeated the incumbent Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
Now I am working on a project for the Bala government.
I will continue to stay in the PDP, they have given me what they promised, so I will not give them a chance to reject me, I will go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a resignation letter from the PDP which he sent to the male leader of the party, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said that, just as he had reminded the other governors where they had failed and where they should fix it, Bala was not exempt.
Let them go on their journey.

Commissioner Mojisola Adeyeye announced that on Tuesday in Abuja City.
Mojisola said that tests are being done on the medicines because each area needs to get the best results.
People around the world have been looking to traditional remedies to see if they can provide a solution to the coronavirus, as research continues to try and find a cure.
Many of them have submitted their medicine samples to the government for testing and verification of its authenticity.
The NAFDAC has imposed certain regulations and guidelines for them to follow when producing the remedy.
We will test the effectiveness of animal vaccines for the first time.
Mojisola warned those administering medicine not to recklessly administer any medication without permission from the authorities.

APC Urges Governor Neja To Bring Change To The Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) issued a statement this week accusing the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring division into the party.
The agreement, signed by the President of the Engineering Association Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Secretary of the Barista Association Muhammed Liman, states that in the six years the association has been in power in the state, it has only received Naira 512 million.
The delegate continued to say that the meeting called by the governor, which was chaired on Monday last week, will help to bring about unity in the party, where they said they had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the factions of the party by organizing a heated meeting, which is not based on rules, in order to address any complaints against the party leaders, they should be written to the party secretary for investigation."
Since the establishment of the party six years ago, there has been a total of 512 million naira in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor's role was to be part of the national reconciliation committee established on July 25, 2020, which the president had appointed to lead the negotiations of the disputes between the parties and to resolve the court cases between the parties.
We used the funds we received to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries, and for other activities related to the party, such as organizing elections, resolving disputes, and providing health care assistance due to lack of access to government aid, without spending any party funds in an unauthorized manner, and we challenge anyone to provide us with evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I have stated, the most important election of local government officials in the state that we have conducted in the past, along with the former and current commissioners in charge of authority in all twenty-five local governments in the state, is the election in which the funds spent on the elections were distributed to the commissioners to bring their constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being misused without any basis, this is almost an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name to the party in an attempt to discredit it, he said there is no committee that has been set up to investigate how party funds are being misused and who set it up.
The complainant claimed that the money he was accusing of being embezzled was money given by the national party treasurer, not any other money, so I challenge him to provide evidence to support this accusation in any way possible.
The Imam said that we should stand firmly behind the APC party against any individual or group attempting to undermine the party, and he added that any allegations against the party or any of its leaders from the state level should be referred to the disciplinary committee as stated in Article 21 (B) (d) of page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the water carriers of the party have no role to play especially when they attempt to seize control of the committee, so their verdict has no effect.
Therefore, they are the approved leaders of the party in the state, as stated in Article 21, Section 6, of the party's constitution, and any deviation from this will not be accepted.
The ruling that the rulers should obey was a mistake.
Yesterday, those who presented and agreed at the unproductive meeting, including Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The committee responsible for the nomination of party delegates shall be chaired by the party's National Chairman, Engineer Mohammed Imam, and not by the Governor of the state.
The statement further noted that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello had reminded of the commitment made to the people of the state during the election, to travel with the party's parents in the government so that everyone would benefit from the state and all factions through the provision of political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The motion to commend the members of the National Assembly who attended the meeting and to draw attention to the need for reconciliation on all issues between the party members was not surprising to the members who knew their own guilt and refused to accept fraud as a party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the committee chair to call on the state governor Abubakar Sani Bello to take the appropriate stance and refrain from attempting to politicize the state.

Grace Olasumbo, a renowned nutritionist, has called on Nigerians to avoid consuming fruits ripened with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used by traders to cut stone, namely marble.
Research shows that patience and perseverance are among the things that make traders use this resource to show commodities in just one day.
Olasumbo said that something that traders have failed to recognize is the use of this substance to demonstrate the potential of gemstones to cause harm to human health.

COVID-19 is causing Trump to campaign heavily in Florida for the election.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he has cancelled the major Republican convention scheduled to give him the nomination ticket in Jacksonville, Florida, in the coming weeks, due to the increasing cases of coronavirus.

Strengthening the Unity of Nations Through Food and Nutrition - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the soul of all living beings, one cannot live without food.
This is the reason why the Chinese government is increasing its efforts to ensure the safety of the country's people and food supply.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in the field of food security, a feat that has amazed the world given the country's population, estimated to be 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has greatly helped the cause of China in providing major contributions to global hunger relief, as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China, Zhang Wufeng, has previously stated that since 1949 to the present, China has always placed the issue of hunger relief at the forefront of all its national activities.
Last week, people and media outlets from around the world once again "expressed concern" about whether China could effectively contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus to other parts of the world?
We are deeply grateful to them for always taking care of the Chinese presence in this world.
The Chinese Communist Party has achieved the goal of providing sufficient food through its efforts.
Providing food for the needy is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party every day.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS Committee, President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that any food waste and labor is obtained.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruption to the world has brought hardship to the economy of China, China will still be able to provide sufficient food for its people.
According to the announcement made by the Chinese government regarding the amount of agricultural products, especially rice, that the country will obtain this year 2020, the amount of rice obtained in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, which was an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period of 2019.
The former president of the Agricultural University of China said that China has achieved great successes in terms of economic development and food security compared to the beginning of the reform and opening up policy.
Huang Jikun, the director of the Research Institute of Agricultural Mechanization of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the representative of "The China Science Daily" in an interview that the biggest challenge China is facing in the next two or three years is whether it can reduce the amount of coal and grain stored in warehouses.
Now, each person has received 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms each person in the world should receive each year.
China is now introducing millions of tons of agricultural products to only domestic livestock farms.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should calm down, take a bath, go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
They are able to provide for themselves with the food they produce.

In an interview with Daura, the brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a zoning system will be used in the 2023 presidential election.
In order to effectively combat the spread of social media misinformation, the Igbo have taken the initiative to issue a statement to President Buhari, calling for an end to discrimination.
On Wednesday, the Igbo ethnic group in the South East and South-South regions of Nigeria declared that they will allow the President to contest in the 2023 elections, meaning the Igbo people.
The President of the Igbo Ethnic Group Association, Emeka Attamah, said that Mamman Daura's statement is like a declaration of Nigeria's presidency in 2023 for the Igbo people.
In the past year, Mamman Daura has been making frequent speeches since 2019.
Jonathan Sun Game and Sun Kori, now Daura is leading the Northern region in the 2023 election that will govern Nigeria.
He will step down from his position as the leader of this country now, and then he will bring us a surprise issue that we don't know about in 2023.

United Northern Media Writers Unite the North.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, and others have long been playing a major role in providing platforms for conversations, connections, and unity between different communities around the world, as well as sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational, and commercial agendas.
Nigerian youths have embraced this new technology of using social media platforms to travel, to give and receive assistance, or to express their opinions on matters that affect their lives.
We can say that these developments have brought us many advances that the youth of the North have benefited from in business, economics, education, and politics in the region.
Many people are ordering food online, getting jobs done, or expanding their businesses by typing and sending messages over the internet.
It is sad to see how some people instead of using this opportunity to gain progress, there are some who follow the plight of the disadvantaged children in this country and abroad, either by fleeing from public persecution, within and outside the country, or by writing articles of criticism and insulting government officials and dignitaries.
What shows the lack of progress, is embedded in the lives of the youth of this country.
The Northern Media Writers Association in Nigeria is a great blessing to the youth of the North, providing them with quality content, good morals and promoting the activities of the youth on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and spread the ideals of the Northern people.
We must all join this organization to achieve its noble objectives, which will bring not only benefits to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
We invite all citizens, especially those using social media, to join us in protecting the rights and freedom of the North, and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.
The Northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their successors have strived to provide for the people of the North.
A late great leader, Malam Aminu Kano, once said, "Nigeria is one, but everyone knows their own home!"
We reiterate our call for the advancement of our nation and the improvement of our governance system, at every level, and we further call for unity among Northerners, without prejudice to religion or ethnicity, to bring progress to our region.
Consider how the North used to be, not how it is now.
We should make use of the wisdom that God has given us to provide the North with a sustainable path to economic prosperity and advice.
Northern Region should create revenue sources to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide funds.
In order for us to progress in the North, we must prioritize education, agriculture, tourism, health, science and technology.
We can't give help directly, there are different ways to do it.
So that's how North will fulfill our collective aspirations!
We are proud of our heritage.

The response of the senator representing Kwara North in the APC party, Sadiq Umar, was that the Nigerian government should prioritize the improvement of the nation's health care system.
She has no means of income in her field, which has caused her to rely heavily on foreign aid.
Umar said that despite the support they were receiving, there was no visible effort from the government in the health sector, which led them to start withdrawing the support they were giving.

Yankee Justice Cannot Be The Solution To Nigeria's Problems - Maigidaje.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, a prominent figure in the Kaduna State community, has indicated that the only solution to the issue of rape in Nigeria, particularly in the North, is to impose the death penalty on those convicted of the crime.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this during his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that if the government confirms it after investigation, the only solution is to impose the death penalty.
He said that making a ruling would reduce the number of rape cases that can be obtained, but the biggest relief is to change our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, let us always remember to obey Allah and His Prophet, and to keep our promises, for no one knows when they will die.
He said that it is a shame that a grown man would take a young girl, either three years old or five years old, and rape her.
And he continued to say, between us and God, we will not keep on criticizing rulers or kings, where he indicated that there is no way a country can progress if such disrespect is present.
He said that this is why we are in a state of lockdown and hardship in the country, because the rulers, the Governors, and the President have no idea how to move forward with the situation.
He said that after they destroyed that wall, another one came up, so it is necessary for us to change our minds so that God can bring us a solution to the rape issue.
We should be aware that, even if it is done for safety, everything should be submitted to God because He is the one who relieves all distress and poverty for the people.
No matter what situation you find yourself in, God is aware of you and whatever you do, so always be mindful and humble, and always remember that you will die and always remember that you have a past, and if you have done something wrong, you must make amends.
It has been reported that the police are doing their best to send those accused of rape to the Magistrate Court for proper trial, which has become a menace in our Northern Nigeria region and the country at large.

The film follows the footsteps of the song "Black is King" by Beyonce, which celebrates the continuing influence and success of Black people around the world, due to their representation of African culture.
Many people said that this movie, which was filmed in the African country of South Sudan and is 85 minutes long, exceeded expectations.

Strive, Persevere and Seek to Excel, It is in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan Village in Hongsipu District of Wuzhong City in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, located in the northern part of China.
Li Yaomei (also known as Sadiya in Islam) is famous for her struggles in life and her success in escaping poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort, perseverance and striving for success are all in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never attended school with the intention of learning, which is why she was unable to read or write.
May God grant her wisdom, courage, and great wisdom, so that she may be an example in the fight against poverty.
Twenty years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from a severe abdominal illness, which required her to undergo surgery three times.
Suddenly, she encountered a terrible accident, and now she is traveling with a cast on her leg.
These challenges she faced put her in a difficult situation, even concerning the issue of medication, which is why she had to take on a debt of around 3 million Yuan, equivalent to about 16 million Naira.
Mrs. Sadiya was surprised by this challenge, which gave her a way to express herself and improve her life through writing and reflection.
The financial support provided by the Chinese government has increased her confidence.
She is able to make different kinds of dishes using spices.
Thanks to her hard work, her business has grown significantly, where different employees give her donations.
She has created many tools that help her streamline her work.
For example, it used to take her 15 minutes to assemble one big puzzle, but now in this time, she can assemble up to 5 puzzles.
The bay has a hook, which provides additional lines to keep the anchor secure and steady.
There is an additional engine that can make pet food, and now they are selling these engines to those who are looking for them.
By looking at the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she has made to improve her own life and that of her employees, it can be understood that she is indeed a seeker of success.
Fighting poverty and improving life is not something that can be left to the government alone.
If the government provides support, but people have no motivation or interest in improving their lives by taking initiative and working according to their current situation, then progress will only be made without achieving any goal.
The labyrinth shows that running a business or undertaking to make money does not require large amounts of money or trips to other cities or countries.
She considered her situation and used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks independently without relying on her husband, since he had left her.
Perseverance and determination to strive for success is something that is in the heart.
She showed the strength that women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone else.
This is a lesson that shows that whatever one does, one should stand by their convictions, for relying on another is not certain.
Indeed, Malama Sadiya was a diligent, wise and prudent woman who became an example and a lesson to others.
Today, by the end of March, Mrs. Sadiya has paid all the debts she was owing, and has stopped receiving government aid for her living expenses.
Faeza Mustafa.
US Political Leaders Must Redouble Efforts to Contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The World Health Organization's (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern over the measures taken by some countries to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be made available, stating that it must be avoided to show favoritism to certain countries while distributing the vaccine.
All resources should be shared equitably around the world, as this would be in line with the major interests of different countries.
Some American politicians are pursuing a strategy of demonstrating their own power, regarding the distribution of vaccine resources, and they are undermining the cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
So far, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already surpassed 23 million.
Over 800 people have lost their lives due to the disease.
In this extremely difficult situation, attention and focus has been placed on the effects of the vaccine against the virus, and the good news is that, in recent weeks, there has been a great breakthrough in the research of the vaccine in some countries, giving hope and faith to the entire world population.
Some American politicians have shown a desire to seize the oil reserves.
According to the journal "Science", the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase more than six billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various pharmaceutical companies.
Although the purpose of the US government is understood, being the leader in the fight against the virus, other developing countries also need adequate resources, given that they are facing a shortage of health care facilities.
The Ecologist magazine has stated that if the US achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the amount of emissions available to developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, the Director of the African CDC, expressed his concern about this issue after the outbreak of the disease in the facility.
