The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-one year old native of Plzeň will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
Former goalie of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk was injured during preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was substituted at exactly the halfway point of the game against Vegas and has not been seen on NHL ice since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
The Denver team announced at the beginning of October that Pavel Francouz would be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body.
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
He has recorded 94.5% of his saves in AHL.
The Plzeň hockey graduate wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille for Christmas, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
For their Christmas wish this year, British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported about it on their website.
Wishing friends, colleagues, and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte has a dress too.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear when the photograph was taken, and William and Kate did not reveal who took it.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting in front of a pile of straw and a stack of wood at their rural estate in Norfolk county.
The royal couple, Prince Charles and Camilla, also released a photo to serve as a Christmas greeting.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the races at Ascot in June.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask that matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Police investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the allegation that the accused former vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported that they had access to parts of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovice Club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-white had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which former Slavia sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is mainly featured.
According to the file, a former influential official of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berbr and former Vyšehrad sports director Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in this case.
The detectives reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
Team SK Slavia Praha won the title of the first league in 2019.
The police had the knowledge that Roman Berbr was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the criminalists, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdíkem.
The file does not indicate whether the police are still investigating this information.
He firmly rejected any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the status quo in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
We have never committed any unlawful acts, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and provided any financial remuneration in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, among other things, Nezmar unsparingly insults some former Slavia players of dark complexion and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
Last October, the police launched an operation at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, to investigate allegations of match-fixing through referees.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz was released from custody, just like before.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are LARPing Cold War.
The guns will be new, but of a generally worse type (gunners must leave the armored cab and carry shells by hand without protection).
The Toyota Hi-Lux cars are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - up to a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Planes: combat - decent, but at the end of lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential.
We don't have any rockets (but we do manufacture and export them abroad).
PVO: medium-cold war era, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
The hunt is right next to the town.
I went there once because beavers were coming out of the river and causing damage to the crops.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went soon after.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost soiled himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I shouted at him that it was for a fox.
Before I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That means the field of men can be a failure.
On the other hand, it's not war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on thermal vision, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuable items in a visible place near your feet in your backpack and you should be good.
Vojtech vs. Hamacek.
The Interior procured respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, respirators and masks for professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for a respirator differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities acted frugally?
Why were others shopping more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I'm not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't have large stockpiles of equipment for the recruits to take up, nor do we have modern equipment even for the existing professionals, and furthermore modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the abilities of the reserves will be rapidly diminishing over time.
With modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, leaving no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is necessary to lead a mass guerrilla warfare and it is also an expressed necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, a fight will only be possible in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the suitable geography for it.
We don't have individual skill mainly.
It could be worse.
The worst part is that half of them are playing as if they had it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you look like a fool who two minutes ago couldn't hit an empty goal, charging into attack alone against two or even three Swiss players, and you're thinking to yourself, "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "drawing a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw our attacker manage to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows.
The COVID-19 pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will remain for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness helps against it.
This week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the COVID equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
Soon it should be supplemented by the Pfizer drug Paxlovid, which reports a success rate of 85 percent from the current results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravirus to the Czech Republic have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As previously stated, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to be made available to domestic patients.
The company finished first in the race because the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic began, with the aim of finding an appropriate treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in these studies is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as we are told".
You will do research asking people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
Then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
He is afraid of cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing his job and facing a media lynching.
It looks good in the polls, West good, East bad.
But will they really find out what people think.
Only in France do Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% in the polls.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
All objects are exactly the same due to the rotation of units so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is.
One of them is the Atomic Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory for either safety or speed of deployment due to its more western location.
In the underground bunkers (there are two in every maple tree) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived to retrieve the warhead and mount it on some kind of delivery system.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate who was a Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often over-expressed himself, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone enjoyed being with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, and he was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips, did all sorts of crazy things, but he was always okay, never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, enrolled in the same grade but different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often called in to deal with it, they threatened and intimidated other students.
I sometimes sell something on an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any tricks on the price, the communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me a month later saying he had already transferred it to his name.
I say I'm not a racist, it doesn't matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as is expected in polite society (working, functioning, not beating women, just normal behavior).
When someone comes, stretches out their hand, evicts people from their homes and apartments, creates chaos around them, and causes trouble... it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate into our society, start businesses, work, learn a language (not necessarily, but at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it is of no concern to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs as well.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
The spokesperson for South Bohemian Emergency Medical Services, Zuzana Fajtlová, told Právo that a young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons veered into the opposite lane in a bend.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, according to a spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered serious injuries in the accident.
He sustained multiple injuries and was trapped in the vehicle.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with immediate pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czech Budweis hospital in a stable condition, stated rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car had suffered minor chest injuries and had been taken to the hospital.
For parcels from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the information about them.
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where shipping is often free, explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email notification that customs is expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, it will be calculated by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the shipping.
If the recipient does not arrange customs clearance themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I will tick one or two checkboxes, attach two documents, and I'm done.
Neuheisl says it's usually a matter of five minutes for him.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, there is also a problem that people are not responding to requests for the data needed to complete the customs process.
Currently, there are 30,000 packages at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be roughly halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation.
What solutions would you propose to address the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow or offset this growth?
Is this the way forward for you with the reduction of VAT on food and PHM in Poland?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added on (if you are an employee)?
I got a 2% raise this year, which is a joke, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the side while employed.
Could someone explain to me why convicted violent offenders are often only sent to prison for 6 months?
My head just can't wrap around how a court can only sentence such an animal to 6 months behind bars only for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma that his/her victim will have for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of the rape may never recover from it.
Will this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The Man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The Man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself summoned her.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
When the police were called to the scene, they were surprised to find out that the supposed "robbed" person had made up the story in order to get the police to come to the scene.
He actually just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to file a report to the Czech Police.
Upon checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Otherwise I obviously agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill wasn't able to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
I certainly do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without any proof just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say it is quite likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
For even in the Ten Commandments it is written that there is no other god but the Lord.
Wouldn't it be more rational then to refrain from believing in any god rather than risking to choose the wrong one out of thousands and have the one true god I didn't pick send me to hell or some other such place?
Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model is somewhat similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If one conducts oneself well, they may receive a professional offer.
Something like this would be useful for all branches of the Czech Republic Armed Forces.
It could be done in collaboration with the Defense University.
We can talk about the constant dialogue between the educational sector and industry, companies recruiting from schools and a kind of interweaving, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, the institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongol invader will ever enter here again.
It's funny to me how you consider NATO to be set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
Blessings be upon you.
One election in the US that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes down the drain.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show us their backs and they will take whatever they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantor of independence is a well-armed military and a population that can handle the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications, that's outdated now, but a resourceful teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How to not drown in a box-tidal wave.
You open the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home, surrounded by boxes and stuffing?
These "waste" materials are being reused by e-shops that are in need of packaging materials.
A map of stores that will accept your used boxes was created.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is a shame to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved trade (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
Retailers are welcoming the shortage of packaging currently on the market, as well as the savings, as packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of these businesses is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Individuals who accumulate them at home are bringing boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno, but we are also hearing from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems wrong to me that in this day and age technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because apps like Google Photos or Apple Photos, or really any mobile phone, hide the underlying file system with folders and just throw everything onto one screen in the app.
Let them use the techniques from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Last weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of France's EU presidency - starting in January - and it was grand.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in half a year.
French politicians and voters alike love it that way.
Macron's supporters, divided between the right and the left, agree on little, but on Europe they do.
In France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators quickly came forward with criticism that Macron's aim was pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a bit of success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not focus on what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, French, and Czechs are learning who won which battle.
If they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for Best Actress Jasna Duričičovou.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, it held the top spots in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the movie The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu or being under the weather. I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
It was worse than a regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
This is just my personal experience, not everyone has the same.
Christmas Book Tips

The folklorist and comparatist translates the story of Little Red Riding Hood into the backdrop of a modern village.
Her rendition of brutality surpasses folk versions and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.

In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of return from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, with some changes in operators.
Trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the switch of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, and possibly their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets already during the autumn.
Czech Railways are planning to operate an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, including an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will dispatch more new trains in Northern Moravia or in Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will be running a total of 16 services on the route daily, eight in each direction.
Starting from Sunday, there will be changes to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar timetable of its long-distance trains despite the planned maintenance work.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will be changed in some regional routes as well.
Passengers travelling on the route from Mladá Boleslav to Česká Lípa and Rumburk will experience changes, as Trilex trains operated by the German company Die Länderbahn will replace the Czech Railways on the Českolipsko line.
Passengers will be able to use a unified fare for the second year on the railway as well.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we supposed to learn to see things from another perspective?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, and died.
I have never heard a lesson taught from the perspective of the slave owners or from that time period, nobody is defending this, only condemning it.
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Native Americans, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they had been slaughtering each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I have not personally encountered anyone deliberately omitting facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, which I do not deny (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History does not care about someone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when it comes to the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Furthermore, the North was not much better than it is idealized by many people today.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
When I imagine these people being much older one day, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become more radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism are labeled as feminists and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in conclusion, I have not encountered anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I guess I just had bad luck with geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it's interests, perspectives on the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak pastor is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always throws in some nonsense about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Then there is of course the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know many people who are Catholic but attend services of the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there they hold a Mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame has arrived in the Czech Republic, scouts have brought it from Austria.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts were not able to travel to Vienna this time, but they received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it over the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
Last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, but now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes with the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to Bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, traveling by selected express and personal trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations and then spread the flame further throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not lead.
Scouts must follow the current coronavirus prevention measures this year.
It's running similarly to last year.
We recommend that both the courier teams and the organizers of local events wear masks, maintain social distancing, keep their numbers to a minimum, refrain from singing together, and generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope and light overcoming darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to get a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer to the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The money will be put to good use in the development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the walls saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs to x people, this is a hindrance to development where this company is barely holding on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive if it were to go out of business.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Even someone born in the internet age can sometimes get caught in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I thought I was immune to online ads, but then I realized that they had still managed to influence me - it's so sophisticated now that it's hard to resist.
Therefore, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, to quote the classics - I would ban the internet.
I feel like this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but rather I will believe something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I can claim is critical thinking.
I won't believe everything the media says.
I don't trust politicians.
TV networks have jumped on the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles – US and other English-speaking countries' TV networks and streaming platforms have followed the trend of Christmas movies this year, premiering a record-breaking number of over two hundred.
The operator of the IMDb movie database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring points with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only included movies with the word "Christmas" in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated mainly with fairy tales, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
The real boom of Christmas movies only started in 2009 when the American cable television network Hallmark came with a special movie series, reminded the BBC server.
Her Advent project titled "Countdown to Christmas" included four movies and was very successful.
This station started to get its viewers in the Christmas spirit as early as October 22nd and will be airing a total of 42 Christmas movies.
This year, the competing station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total count.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, jokingly described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace for two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
He claims that, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same formula for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about halfway through that is resolved successfully and the two of them kiss.
"It's always the same, and as long as all the films look and feel the same, people watch one after the other," Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive test for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the last race of the season.
Haas team will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming to improve on his 20th place finish, which he had achieved in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Nineteen cars will line up on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher starting from the back and Max Verstappen from the front, ready to battle Lewis Hamilton for the championship title.
According to the statement from the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively okay and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
He/She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives said to formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive.
You could be locked up for this too.

Therefore in the same group as HIV, malaria, jaundice or typhus.
Spreading of infectious human diseases
Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introducing or spreading a contagious disease among people shall be punished by imprisonment for up to three years, a ban on activities or forfeiture of property.
The perpetrator will be punished with imprisonment of two to eight years.
If he breaches an important duty arising from his employment, profession, position or function, or imposed on him by law,
If such an act causes serious harm to health.
If the perpetrator causes serious injury to at least two people or death by the act mentioned in paragraph 1, he will be punished with imprisonment for three to ten years.
If the perpetrator commits the act mentioned in paragraph 1 and causes the death of at least two people, they will be punished with imprisonment of five to twelve years.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in six months of work and all of their savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, as sweaters were never really worn where I'm from," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work over the course of half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarowski company.
He then adorned 150 diamonds with silver stars.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater a softness," praises the creator of the work, which however does not recommend washing.
There's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" 720,000 crowns.

But how would the funding be increased?
The Union is pumping money into us in grants.
If it stops doing that, we will stop having that money.
I really don't see how the EU stopping giving us money would mean that we would use the money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those grants could be used better, but that's a whole different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Engineers, scouts, and drone pilots could set out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with protecting the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in response to the Belarusian regime's actions over the past few months, which have enticed citizens from Middle Eastern countries with false promises of easy passage across the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in Southern Moravia?
The health department is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
We currently have another reported suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's Prep Class.
No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been proven,” said Ciupek.
Six cases have appeared in the county this week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant for our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague, said the director.
She added that there were two nurses from the same workplace at the Faculty Hospital in Brno, two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four have an asymptomatic course.
No one suspected of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of them had traveled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had they had contact with anyone who had been abroad.
None of the listed individuals have any connection to the water polo championship, stated Ciupek.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player who fell ill upon returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
She wants to proceed like Texas with the abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People should then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday statement from the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in place despite it going against the nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide up to roughly 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was thus shifted to the public, thus making it impossible for Texans to challenge it through the usual legal means.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow the preservation of Texas' ban on most abortion services and largely support Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He has instructed his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the Minister of Justice to develop measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are referred to as homemade firearms that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the Governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has been banning the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other US states.
The Supreme Court nevertheless did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue certain officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccine goes through a public testing phase, where the vaccination scheme is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies on the effects of four doses are already pouring out of Israel.
According to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, it's just too early for that right now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should come to the market according to the manufacturer's specifications, promising up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments into the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of the law if it used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
She is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism allowing for the removal of EU funding from countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, said the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, rather than the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept any concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
Trying to make sense of it all... At our local Lidl they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I hadn't been looking at the other things, I had seen the same yogurt multiple times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's for sure, in that narrow section were all the chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to avoid the supermarket, whether there's a sale or not, the golden shop on the square doesn't have as much of a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's organized, so I can be done in ten minutes.
Go to Lidl to take a vacation.
I don't care anymore.
I have been watching for two years how data is handled here like manure, most opponents of vaccination are just a little more off the mark than most supporters of vaccination.
While rational discussion is taking place at an expert level, only extreme views are making it into the public sphere.
From pillar to post.
Binary thinking: Vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Everything forbidden, everything allowed.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to oranges.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But nobody is addressing the fact that the data collection methodology is different in those two countries.
Phew, that was a relief.
Sorry for the rant and wishing you all a nice day.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after being "caught" again she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
After I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few spanks on the bottom (over my clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
I think the important part is the warning, because it gives the child a choice of whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
Usually all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System defense.
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swears and is taught from childhood in school, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be careful with changes.
Imagine this: some nations actually like their rules.
Just like Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
The system has been tested by situations its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
In one thing Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming the majority of crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at FN Brno a several-month-old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less affected and affected than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
There are, however, pediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been admitted to the ICU.
The children with post-COVID syndromes were on the doctor's ward continuously throughout the year.
He said that there is an increase in children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, which requires a stay in an intensive care bed, and added that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old infants.
There are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have children of several months old and adolescents in our care," said the head physician.
He is nevertheless glad that no child deaths due to the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
It also highlights the fact that, like in adults, vaccination in children reduces the severity of the disease and at the same time lowers the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose application even for children," the doctor added.
You can only walk on the marked paths in the peace zone.
But the safe zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside of the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/biking off-trail in the forest is not allowed anywhere unless you have a special permit (but of course it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music is playing in my head, Joseph Kurfiřt is laughing.
He was nurtured by the Liberec Opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that its authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to contain the virus that has now become a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because the grass is mowed, the car is washed with a hose, and the children play with him.
It's just great.
I will sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it'll be great!
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: What the heck did you sell that for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant piles of poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
He who sells says: Speak not ill of the elephant, thus you will not sell the elephant...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is upheld, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a powerful force if it works on its integration.
So far, it has been functioning on an economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
Maybe by the mid-century, the mood will be different and it will be successful.
It occurred to me too and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be word-smithing.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
Taking an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the phrase "all American forces" including their weapons and knowing that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just word-playing :D
Whether it is this way or that way, it is an unreasonable demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the capuchin monkey Milly.
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowering in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland was also feeding the monkey sausages, kebab and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, according to The Sun newspaper.
The primate rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse stated that they had never seen a macaque so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and now she is happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to twelve weeks imprisonment with a one year suspended sentence at the Magistrates Court in Gwent.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay a total of 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing okay, but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She hunched and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she has settled and is content with her mate, her view of new people can still evoke panic within her.
The psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, says Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone during a raid on her flat in connection with a drug charge.
On the footage, one can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 50 thousand Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric times when you bravely skip through the entire 20th century three times?
Are you taking the same things to freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with few exceptions, cares if you know it or understand it.
Mainly get a 1 on the test and then no one will care anymore.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even bat an eye and tell you they don't give a damn.
What the hell are we learning for?
I'm a big fan of general awareness and the reality is that people don't want and don't need it.
In that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it through to them anyway.
It is partially learned for the many people who will need it.
But seriously, that comment about not needing all this to stand at the machine, I meant it completely seriously... ...because you really don't need it.
We are also slowly entering an era where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
Our communist past and the persecution of educated elites have likely contributed to this, but the price of having barbarians manning our machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, then the coronavirus probably would never have reached these proportions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
"Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Tension had been building between Kadrim and Andrea since the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She firmly refused it.
As it can be seen, their relationship not only ended without love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
Kadri angrily retorted in response to Andreino's accusation of lying, gambling, and debts that it was a premeditated attack from him!
Kadri's alleged honesty was not appreciated by his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I usually don't comment on such things and we never really said these kinds of things in our family.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
When I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I care so much about, it just drives me crazy!
I am sorry to have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
It saddens me even more to read such false information, which is likely taken out of context.
I wish everyone could know Kadri like I do, our close friends and family, stands in testimony in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful for everything he has done!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Chao began his robbery spree in the parking lot of a residential area, trying to break into several cars.
According to available information, a total of approximately 330 crowns were stolen from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
On the footage from one security camera, he is then seen walking away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the landlord woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and he called the police.
She then arrested Cchaa.
The man admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the incriminating day.
As he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to a state of pandemic readiness.
When it is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law restricts the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections for the four municipalities.
People in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov voted for new councils on Saturday.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils have dissolved.

Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils and most notably the highly anticipated elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held, said Deputy Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna in Uherskohradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN party candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means they have won two seats.

75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
The Pro Rovnou coalition won in the town of Rovná in Pelhřimov region.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeat elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.

YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Statute Book.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all the things people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal after all, to look good).
I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but keep church and state separate.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the crash into the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
At one o'clock in the morning on Saturday, staff at the county's emergency operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two teams from the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) - medical and health - immediately arrived at the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, medical personnel discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window approximately twelve meters high and landed head-first on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
Upon the arrival of the emergency teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, secured artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava Trauma Center for further care, according to the spokesman of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the disproportionate reactions of the public and authorities than I am about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is mainly doctors and medical staff who are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt.
MMA had an amazing gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Pena was able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
The female bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena brought it.
The American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf", Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also in line with the paper expectations.
Nunes started her journey to victory very aggressively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
Pena refused to be forced into any further mistakes and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm, but was unsuccessful.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents exchanged a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Penny additionally got Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and abandon the attack.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to overpower his opponent with an arm bar.
He didn't have much success at first, but then he put a lot of pressure on his opponent, got them on their back, and rained down a series of strikes.
He won the second round because of that.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out to the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In his next match, Sean O'Malley secured a dominant victory, landing a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
He then knocked him out with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France was able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
After seven years, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, but now she has lost.
Is that a knee or a thigh?
At first glance, it's not anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they take on two endings and in some cases remain in the inflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, the former being declined according to the pattern of "stroj" and the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, such as "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly with other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally inflected, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
An example of this is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remains in the neuter gender, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like at the Greek borders?
Tension is rising at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We hadn't seen a blue sky in three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating bushfires that have been ravaging Australia for the past four months have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will countries have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with a journalist from Sydney, Ikou Detrichovou.
False accusations have always been and are still quite rare.
Everyone is always written about everywhere.
People are uncomfortable addressing how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
A lot of people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
Many people have been put in difficult situations because of this.
She does not have the means to finish the unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
The cost of construction work is also increasing in addition to the cost of materials.
People don't have enough money to finish the already partially built family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and also pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses within a year and it has been done for fifty percent.
For us as a construction company it is difficult in that we have to adhere to certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it without a profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will still have financial problems.
If they had counted on the house construction costing five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will be waiting," added Slivoň.
The materials that saw the biggest price increase were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favorable.
The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year, Křeček specified.
We are doing well and will do even better.
The real vision is missing, says the commentator of Czech Radio - mujRozhlas.
Entering the new year, in addition to the usual celebrations, political speeches have become a traditional part of the festivities.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What have we learned that is essential?
I think the diploma thesis is great because I get to choose my own topic, build on my bachelor's thesis, and work on it for a whole year before writing the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are pretty chill here, as long as you're not a total goofball and you've retained something in your head, the commission won't be needlessly suffocating you with theory.
I had been studying for the state exam for a week and when I was at my wit's end, the committee always tried to guide me towards some logical deduction which I immediately understood and had the answer right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then just learn the project and they're set.
I think it's great when the end of the subject is a test that incorporates the knowledge gained from the project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay but don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be just as much of a jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
If they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, otherwise something bad could happen to them.
But you can still put a similar statue of Putin next to the teddy bear statue.
Maybe give it to her so she can get close enough to slap Xi Jinping's butt or something.
I agree even though Instagram is throwing obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I've been really frustrated lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
In the end, I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Working Party of the Donbas
Unite - yes, break up - no, opponents of the break up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8, 1991, in the Belovezhskaya Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the March 17, 1991 referendum, secretly and without regard for the people, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open indulgent attitude, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of non-Russian populations in the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
The same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built over the previous seventy years in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, stifled agriculture, and detached fourteen republics that had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism from the world's greatest power.
If we look even deeper, we see impoverishment of the population, economic breakdown, science, military, rise in criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is a result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
All that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket does not necessarily correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK per kilogram.
I will buy it and put it in the fridge to make dinner with it on Thursday.
Describe the mechanism by which the change in price of the meat from Monday to Tuesday, from being more expensive to being discounted to 99 Kč/kg, becomes a burden on my digestive system in an alternate reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday?
What would be the difference between the meat I bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and this meat that will be discounted to 69 Kč/kg on Thursday, which I would have to keep in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are really stupid, to be honest ;-)
Recently I was in Brno at Hlavas and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help out the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused but I suspected it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was like a good old-fashioned sermon, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like washing and not being naughty.
What a waste of paper, the forests didn't have to be cut down for this.
I have experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you care about them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me multiple times that she would hurt me because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
When I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship, but then another half year passed and it started to go downhill.
I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her that we could still talk about it the next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will drain you of your energy, emotions, and overall joy.
Keep your distance.
When insurance companies are recklessly buying up clouds of tests and rushing to find positives who would not have known about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator got five days of home confinement.
Out West they have stopped the foolishness and acknowledged that it is not worth trying to fight a sickness weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and he still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing some nonsense.
Looks like our old friend the scoundrel is back again.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering since I wanted to help people, however the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first earned money came, one quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a certain number of products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots and pans.
What I can say is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every piece of gossip and to verify information thoroughly.
Don't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't experienced many of these things in the corporation I work for.
HR is at peace, managers are looking after their own management and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular reviews are happening somehow, in the form that it works here it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, look at what worked and what didn't in a year) - it's more self-assessment than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also somewhat unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a sort of almost-startup, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are good.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the outgoing Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
Kulhánek expressed his sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28th in the bus on her way home from work, before boarding she was supposed to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
After her disappearance, the London police began to search for her and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in connection with this a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but not revealed.
At the end of the year, new councils were elected in four towns.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils have dissolved.
A total of 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
A total of 36 women and 63 men competed for 28 seats in the legislature.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils and most notably the highly anticipated elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
We had to mostly work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which posed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the voting results and, upon approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous infectious disease here at the beginning, but it went without much trouble.
I still struggle to reconcile myself with how stupidly a large portion of the population at all levels approaches this.
I'm most excited for my vaccination tomorrow because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be removed from the office of president and disqualified from holding it again.
The chances of it actually happening are, as others have mentioned here, very slim.
I'm also not sure if the falsification of the record could be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic endangers its sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character.
It must have been something more serious.
The pandemic has impacted intimate life: The number of people aged 35 and under who have gone without sex for a whole year is growing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns religiously motivated people, according to the DailyMail website.
A survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from 8 to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
A survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown that other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals.
One of them can be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, or video games could also contribute, making sex a lower and lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who reported not having sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them reporting to have been without sex in the last year for 2021.
Among unmarried people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital contact and religious beliefs also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, with about 30% thinking it is wrong while around 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among unmarried people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
"Among the less religious, the trend has risen from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
Other factors such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic also contribute to the decrease in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, replacing this need.
This trend has become popular especially during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole debate about vaccinating against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question that I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don't order it for them and they die, will it be our fault.
My argument is that we should certainly be held accountable for the death of an eighty-year-old person who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccination advocate who was here shouting alongside the SPD and the Communist Party about bullying and totalitarian states.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated seniors probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather can even complicate the preparation of the Jizerská Padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it doesn't involve a religious person.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us all around town to the boat dock so we could go out on boats and sail down the river.
On our way there, we went down a quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they came down on us.
I luckily escaped, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul, she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed the whole way to the boat dock.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already crumbling, says Orozovič.
On Sunday, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors, following his previous visits to Paris and Brussels.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Chancellor Merkel has suggested that the crisis caused by Russia's worrying movements near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including those of the "Normandy Group" which includes France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border night after night.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about further sanctions in order to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured the DPA agency that Germany is supporting Warsaw in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to hide it.
The car eventually returned to the scene of the accident, but it was now being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to yield and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had hit another nun who had asked her for help with the vehicle.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and, after finding that she had over two promiles of alcohol in her blood, immediately revoked her driver's license.
They also informed her that she would be held accountable for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his movie.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about canine companions.
They forgot the most important thing: the laws of the film craft.
Following the kitschy movie F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie Tady hlídáme my is now vying for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund returns to the scene with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a Bavarian guesthouse that is struggling, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and most importantly, her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shaimovich (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least that one entertained children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mix of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Despite being a scientist, Julie succumbs to superstitious beliefs in her desire for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian Forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at how much of a convoluted plot full of unbelievable situations and characters was necessary to convey this message.
A pair of thieving staff members, a dog show competition, a Bavarian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal - and of course the crazy family at the pension gets drunk on it all.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma, curls and makeup done, cigar in hand, demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
The creators will then explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shaimovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct supporting situations, a sense of character and point of view, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is clumsy, and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomek and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog puns, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
Membership in the Dachshund Club for many years, as in the case of the producer, is not an argument.
To promote good intentions of nature and friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft in order to tell a believable story.
This did not work out in this case.
There is too much eroticism and too little sentiment for a good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for equine therapy, this amateurish piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is seen how little you understand it, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to those kinds of people, you might change your mind.
It's just like any other job, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The near complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The two days of rain this week were more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It was also the perfect Christmas setting, Wasim Aškar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
The level has been dropping since then.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
In 2018, Uri Schor, a spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted that "depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here."
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are in a worse situation.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, there is an increasing number of water tankers.
Both public water supplies and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces broke out in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river has completely dried up.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the Vienna talks had not yielded "any progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is based in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not made "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted with the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning and doubting the lady for a while and then thanked her and left.
Tell me I'm wrong, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains this weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather.
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is plenty of snow and some ski resorts have opened due to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set off for running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were blessed with the weather today, offering sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased that the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the Ještěd Sports Area Director Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseníky mountains for the first weekend of skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branné in Šumperk were open.
The weekend turnout was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, did not spare praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the timeframe of having recovered from COVID-19.
Except for a few exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center to CTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
There is fortunately interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
A higher influx is expected during ski courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
Before the pandemic, we were almost ready to be loaned out.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
He said that people have become lazy and learned to stay at home due to the pandemic.
The rental service at Novako in Boží Dar has seen a high demand.
They started renting out skis there a week ago and now interested people have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the area operator.
Interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the pandemic, according to her.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in our country, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they would abroad.
That certainly doesn't include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and capable people are leaving the country with no possessions.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad so easily.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not stay in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started when one day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is, are there even elections?
If life here is lived stupidly, then some traditional V4 crazy person can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, while his supporters and people whose wealth cannot fit in an airplane will remain.
Terrifying photo!
Longmayer in a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the cast and crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), were enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or just makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petr's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Srncová worked, in a video on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work and headed home to the Camberwell area around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncova acted as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to be found to contact the police, the statement continued.
Publicly calling for cooperation, Harriet Harman MP highlighted the case of the Stag on Saturday at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, and her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have an especially big responsibility to try and find her, as she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare," said Harman.
Police previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
It is not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our interference.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to the situation in 1938 is so off in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would be in line with the "focus" on the borders.
Agreements must be kept.
New timetables for suburban trains will be in effect in Prague from Sunday.
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the system.
Fast trains from České Budějovice will stop at Zahradní Město station in the capital city from Sunday.
Trains S7 will depart in suburban rail transport, running from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague Main Station.
The newly opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded to other areas.
In addition, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending to the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted during integration.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague Zličín and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has been created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
The morning peak and weekend connections from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened, with the new express line number 404.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region have been newly added to the PID system.
They are departing from Střížkov Metro Station, not from Nádraží Holešovice Station.
Line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou, Česká Lípa, and Nový Bor, and some selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 bus line runs through Mělník, Dubou, Doks, Mimoně, and Jablonné v Podještědí.
In contrast, the operation on ten local Central Bohemian lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague-Beroun, Prague-Lysá nad Labem and the area around Kolín.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections to Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses to the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
A healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket to the office.
Hi, I'm doing the usual 9-5 with a 30 minute break and my only option for getting food is to go to Billy next door or a bit further to the Lidl.
Since I have no physical activity after work, I have to eat as healthy and dietetically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, so I usually just grab some pizza slices, yogurt, and an apple for a snack.
What healthy food would you recommend me to buy from the supermarket without needing to cook it?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately that is the case.
It's not about the trees that you have to see necessarily.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Admitting Darya's relationship with Nedved: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing else since Friday than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since summer, the famous footballer even got divorced for the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love hidden from them for half a year.
I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not noticed that Dara has caught a bear, excuse me, Nedved, jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He is said to have been the one to break it off, not her.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not take joy in it.
Here it is.
What we both dreaded but knew would come eventually, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out of a can at them, or us whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together, or if you insisted that everyone should know your list of ex-partners and be aware of your mistakes and errors.
That's the way it is, that's what you want, doesn't bother Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was going for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been serving as vice president of Juventus Football Club for a long time.
They only went public with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife had been separated for three years, officially divorced for only three weeks.
We thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are all just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found apartments together, which I think is the best option because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments usually aren't advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that way it's nice, besides it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know where you are enrolling exactly).
I've never looked for a rental myself, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly help with information about Brno if you need any more.
That is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually okay that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can learn whatever they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and have the state pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take over a piece of the education system just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and thus be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by someone who expressed themselves in such a way about a petition to boycott a totalitarian state two days before.
So your vote against someone getting an abortion is the same as your vote against a statue being put up in a town square?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job if I were you.
Otherwise, I have experienced in cataloging/digitizing that even long-time professionals either guess or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would handle it in a note depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that matches what is physically on the coin.
Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
P.S. Someone has already solved it here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH.
Politicians have no idea what will be the "topic" of our presidency.
This is a much bigger problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood some text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing extra-standard relationships.
Plus, it's quite interesting with the English language after the UK's departure from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's going great.
I drive home from work at 10pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has never been there can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they're not supposed to :D definitely not something that would make me afraid to go out on the street at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable housing with good access to the city center, I'd go for it.
There are now a lot of apartments newly renovated or newly built there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his beloved Gelemová like a stick in the fence!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády wearing a wreath and I'm sure Lucie has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
The little bird still doesn't know where it will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met up with Anička, Felix, and both of their grandchildren.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together Again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
I'm buying gifts gradually and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, maybe a perfume.
Felix, who had come to the Richman club for the music video launch, declared himself a gentleman.
I am alone here, but I don't feel alone.
Slováček always finds someone to have a good time with, he was happy to meet his wife Luděk Sobota's Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
Are we Iceland to be able to afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will come to our defense and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute fool not to occupy this territory.
I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, can you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
That our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite a while.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water levels have decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places where there was previously no shortage of moisture have recorded lower amounts of rainfall.
The cause of the drought that is prevailing in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are further exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What should you prepare for in relation to drought?
How can we help nature in these difficult times?
Yeah, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I don't know anything about playing hockey and the tactics I tried out in Franchise Hockey Manager are also a total mess.
Whether you are the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when the score is tied.
Listening to Czech commentators pointing out what the referees are paying attention to or not, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the same with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports like F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
The number of coronavirus infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, with another 74.
There have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been recorded.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infection caused by Omikron, Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Safety Office, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omikron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
On Sunday, British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated that Boris Johnson likely broke the law when he held a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually", via computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in it at Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
Despite the strict lockdown imposed in London during last December, which banned Christmas parties, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them.
Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is speaking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Amazing how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is expecting elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of European-wide significance.
How much can be expected to be fair?
It won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, since the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to their own benefit, and does other small or large tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can choose in practice where they want to vote.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if they would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big change for Viktor Orban and his party.
Will they try to keep their power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the hints of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new developments.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I was also very temperamental and used to get so angry as a child that I would lie on the ground in a fit and turn blue, so they had to take me to the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they would give me a disciplinary slap, sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, I used to fight a lot when I was younger, now I just punch something to let out my anger, and when I was younger I would maybe slap my parents' hands (so I wouldn't get a spanking), so nothing too extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not sure to what extent this is due to my temper, but certainly my upbringing has had a part in it.
I'm afraid I'm going to start losing patience with my kids and dealing with it the same way.
I think it's wrong to hit children and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not in that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes up something, so it's probably impossible not to spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
I'm not offended by it, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who make laws in such quality "kundamis".
Otherwise, I'm curious if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product so that you will have enough to pay off the mortgage?
Kočner's Monstrous World.
Where will Slovakia take the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial of the four suspects accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová is beginning in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What major breakthrough will the process mean for Slovakia?
The journalists are to blame for this huge mess.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day or two later?
No, they got carried away and the company had to pay the price.
People were dying from COVID on Czech television even half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage sites nowhere.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council has suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
Its content is however in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local authorities expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the storage of nuclear waste, as promised since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, as required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in accordance with its coalition agreement in collaboration with municipalities.
The municipalities are criticizing the proposed law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has available, mainly for the following: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of selecting a location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective only when communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
It can be ensured by the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposed substantive plan almost completely ignores public involvement and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of locating, permitting, and operating a storage facility.
Representatives of municipalities have limited legal options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a storage site.
Only in certain permitting proceedings can people submit their comments or appeal, however it is the authority or minister in whose interest the permit is issued that makes the decision.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction works.
The co-determination of local authorities that Platforma is requesting is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those that have already progressed in permitting repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work is to be almost 4 million crowns according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Storage, said: We expect a more significant change from the new government than from the ministers of industry, who only pushed off the equalization of the position of local authorities to state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors.
We offer a helping hand as well.
We also thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Geological Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repositories.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for potential disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Fear drove John Goodman (69) to lose weight: He shed 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, eventually he was scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
That did the trick.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new look in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a totally different person!
John joked that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Get moving, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, said Goodman to ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, such as a university text, I would look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are more than one type of bosses for everything.
Games like Dark Souls have several bosses, so a "boss" is like the ruler or master of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Are there games like Half-Life where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called something?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the word "boss" into one word in Czech or any other language (Catalan is an interesting exception, as it translates "boss" as the final enemy).
It is essentially a computer-controlled, stronger-than-all-previous-enemies, guardian of some level or task completion that is significant to the story or game in general.
The whole world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for missing Peter Srncek since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since December 7th.
Through Interpol it also helps the British police.
Petra Srncova's colleagues last saw her on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has now been posted on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what he had to do with Petra.
Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to grab the user's attention with a title that references payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment was labeled as an invoice, but this time it was marked as "Copy of Repair Receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials which are then sent to attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the end of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, attackers' activity is increasing again.
Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The formbook contained most often an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The term receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity with the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the shots of the procession along the waterfront and my experience of the protester, I estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the quay and bridge, as well as the opposite quay road.
That means people really care.
Thousands of demonstrators were joined by an unprecedented number of passersby in the procession.
I assert that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and their ilk could not have filled or paid for such a large procession.
The activities of the Dead Dog Club have been gaining in popularity, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be formed from this discontentment, it depends not only on the influx of money but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine becomes a four or more dose vaccine.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
It is almost certain that the three-dose vaccine will become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action by the scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
The end of the deadlock, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to assemble a government of a broad coalition that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties advocating a fight against corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more premature elections followed.

The secretly taken footage has become a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns were growing about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petr's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station, where Srncová worked, in a video on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work and headed home to the Camberwell area around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncova acted as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to be found to contact the police, the statement continued.
An anonymous informant reported that Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (a regional Pirate Party councilor) from Šumperk, an amateur painter of children's rooms, is violating copyright with her paintings.
The court ruled that the paintings of Little Mole in the rooms of Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Usti nad Labem, there was a moon-shaped hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD), which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained open.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate began to "intensively resolve the situation".
