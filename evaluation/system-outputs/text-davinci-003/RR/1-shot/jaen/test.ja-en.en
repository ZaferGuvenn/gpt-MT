When I tried to buy the entry package, two packages came out, one blue and one orange.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What's the difference?
Please help me, I couldn't find the answer by researching.
There should only be blues now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They look different but they are the same.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who would be stronger if two people of the same height and weight fought?
Jiu-Jitsu
Generally, karate only practices sparring with each other.
Because Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in particular, involves practicing techniques for dealing with strikes, among other things.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation by Durandal against the Treaty of Junius?
Because they were unable to have children due to genetic incompatibility, did they part ways because the genes weren't that compatible?

Finally, I got my Social Security Number.
I called multiple times to make an appointment for an interview about America, but there was no response. After a month, I called multiple times again and finally got an appointment, although they said it would arrive within two weeks. It took almost a month to finally get it.
I guess it was a good practice for speaking English on the phone, but it was too hard to understand on the phone.
The paper is so thin it looks like it will tear easily.
I was imagining a card like a Social Security card.

I don't even feel like watching TV anymore because of all that stuff.
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix and there were a lot of scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
Even though it's obviously not funny, it's creepy how people laugh at everything a popular comedian says just because they're popular.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it would be bad for the comedian's mood and it would be awkward for them to work together.
It's like the old black companies, where the industry is very athletic and some entertainers have too much ego and take a bad attitude, so they have to do it to survive.
On the other hand, many comedians often emphasize the difficulty of their work by saying "Don't belittle comedians".
I know that income is quite low until you become popular, but it's hard to be an entertainer and it's not like you can just stand at the top of the job list every time you're told.
It sounds like a justification for his own career enhancement and the over-representation of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts to the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the entertainment industry is becoming increasingly unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like I had to let it out or it wouldn't be good for my body, like a fart.

The product I ordered from the Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale, but the wired version of the mouse arrived instead. I was told that if I wanted a refund, I would have to send it back.
Even though it's not really related to the topic of custom PCs, I'm having trouble with an online purchase and I can't make sense of it, so I'm posting it here since it's a well-known place.
It all started when I discovered that the MSI Wireless Gaming Mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen on the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the page for the wired version and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Tako), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order confirmation email was received normally, and the shipping confirmation email was also received the next day.
The names of the "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" were written in both emails and purchase history on my page.
Since there were no miscommunications or cancellation notifications from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
A few hours after shipping, an email came saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to the email.
They were selling the wireless version at a discounted price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
He rejected the reception and all were cancelled.
Return the mouse only for a refund.
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose your response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version, even though the product pages are separated between wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes all say wireless version.
Isn't it unfair for them to send the wrong item without any prior notice and then expect us to return it for a refund?
In the end, I want to make a counterattack and accept the refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Residents of Yatsuka Town in Fukushima Prefecture, which is isolated twice due to typhoons and heavy rain, have tripled their emergency food supplies as the only bridge connecting the district has been washed away (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Takachiho Hara district of Yatsuka-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of the 8-person household.
Matsumoto: "At first, it was like, 'Really?'"
I felt like it was all happening so quickly, like it was being swept away. The only road connecting the Takahigahara district, the Takahigahara Bridge, was swept away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents, forced to go without water, had to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually off-limits, to transport the necessary supplies every day.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto said, "Normally I can drive to the garden, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry or hold it and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the convenience of having a car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the isolated state was restored for a few days until a temporary bridge was put in place.
Two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures to prevent it from happening again.
Matsumoto: I think there are about 10 cases.
We thought it would be best to secure at least two or three days' worth of food, so we stocked up on canned and cup noodle food that can be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misa Matsumoto: "I felt that it is better for everyone to prepare a little, because you never know when a disaster will strike you personally, not someone else. Meanwhile, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with the bridge being washed away."
The town started its own initiatives in 2021 to ensure that lessons are not forgotten.
Ryuuichi Takahashi, Head of the Education Division of Yatsurugi Town: "We have announced that we would like to designate October 12th as 'Yatsurugi Town Disaster Prevention Day' in order to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more.

Experience a ParaMarathon in Virtual Reality (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympics.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the attractions of Tokyo through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were provided, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment to run on a virtual marathon course that was recreated in a virtual space.
Each tablet projects a virtual space where participants can experience a marathon race with their own avatars, competing with other participants from both inside and outside the country. They can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery was so different and so much fun!"
The Tokyo official said, "It's tough running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's really fun to be able to run and enjoy it while competing with everyone else. I'm glad I was able to push through to the end. We want to make sure people can enjoy it in sports gyms and other places in the future." They plan to set up more of these in the new year.

What are the pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system, established to revitalize the used housing market, is doing well with used housing transactions.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums have been rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
With the increase in people wanting to stay at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower", while relatively cheaper newly built properties have seen a sharp decrease, likely due to the same effect.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, with the aim of providing safe and secure used housing transactions (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system where an architect who is knowledgeable in housing checks the current condition of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, and then presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the introduction of inspections would benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, giving the buyer peace of mind.
This could also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits.
Under the current system, the seller usually has the primary responsibility for conducting a building survey.
Additionally, it should be noted that the announcement of the inspection system was only mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the mediation has the obligation to explain whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or not, but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking abroad, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used market is thriving, similar systems have already been established with the seller taking the lead in the inspection process, with the risks that this entails.
Before a real estate purchase, buyers are required to request a building inspection from experts known as inspectors or building surveyors.
In the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the buyer is in charge of the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly for the seller, is significantly different in nature.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building in the best light possible, in order to get the highest price and sell it quickly.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey results and considering making appropriate repairs so they can live in the property with peace of mind.
Even though they have the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the intentions and desires of both sides.
Therefore, the following points are highlighted as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection under the seller-led inspection regime set by the country is kept to a minimum.
Due to the lack of detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection could be conducted with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

As they were walking around Ginza, she suddenly pointed out the silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula back in the day."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza, the iconic shopping district in Tokyo's Chuo Ward that has spawned "Ginza" districts throughout Japan.
Originally, "Ginza" was a silver mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryogae-machi", but when it moved to Ginza it became known as "Ginza" by nickname.
It is said that once upon a time, the area around Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now known as Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Kiyomasa developed the city by digging canals and improving the waterways for transportation.
They then cut down the embankment, demolished the Kanda mountain, and filled in the inlet.
If you are interested, you can look for the monument of "The Birthplace of Ginza" near the front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), which indicates the site of the former Ginza Town Hall.
The "pilgrimage" to Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Tour" is held in Ginza, a pilgrimage known only to those in the know.
Among the more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are often people who visit before and after the performance.
Meanwhile, the "Ryukou Fudouzon" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and the "Ginza Shusse Jizouzon" is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The Takadono Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine, and Toyoiwai Inari Shrine are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable, but the Toyoiwai Inari Shrine is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The Seiko Inari Shrine located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
Most of the shrines on this temple tour have Inari as their enshrined deity, although some also include Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" was built enthusiastically as it was believed that it would bring the benefit of abundant harvests of the five grains to the many farmers in the area.
This eventually led to the belief that business prosperity would be beneficial in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in the Ginza, Japan's most prosperous district, faith spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve was cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to help the pain subside quickly.
Will the severe pain I feel when I touch my teeth go away in a few days even before treatment?

A man's body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found dead, lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Sho-nakagawa River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku and reported it to the 110 emergency number.
The man was rescued from the river, but was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police are quickly confirming the identity of the deceased and investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, a man in his 70s was found lying in the Sunagawa River in Okazaki-shi Fukuoka-machi, and his death was confirmed.
The man's clothing was not disheveled, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.

South Korea's Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
On December 12th, Posco International announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire shares of Senex Energy and to invest in the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending approval of the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and local corporate procedures.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Postcoin International was integrated into the Postco Group in 2010.
The acquisition cost was set at 770.9 billion won, with Posco International investing 50.1% and Hanhock Energy investing 49.9%.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas will divide the market with green hydrogen, leading to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operational personnel in Australia.

Could the knee pain be due to osteoarthritis?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause - Yahoo! News
Editor: I've been having persistent knee pain lately.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shock and make joint movement smoother.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis affect joints other than the knee?
Yes, Professor Maruyama.
In addition to the knee, joint and tendon injuries can also occur in the fingers, neck, waist, big toe, and hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, known as "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint, exactly?
Professor Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
The part where the two bones meet is covered by articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editor: So it has a complex structure?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Inside the joint capsule there is a tissue called synovium which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate can help to make knee movements smoother, which is why they are recommended.
Editor: What symptoms occur when someone has osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: The articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion role.
However, if it wears down or becomes misaligned, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash, I sleep in a tracksuit or something similar.
Are there people who can quit smoking, as well as those who cannot quit smoking?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy into it, but they quit completely.
He said he had a feeling he should quit, so he ended up quitting without doing anything else.

Experience the Gambling & Game 3 Selections (Real Sound) of the "Kaiji" Series - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series of gambling manga, which enjoys explosive popularity among men.
One of the highlights of this game is the extreme game of life and death.
Just looking at this photo makes my feet tingle...challenge yourself to cross the steel beam!
I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or implemented in a promotional video.
The pachinko machine "Numa" featured in the movie "Kaiji: The Ultimate Gambler" is full of traps.
In the original story, Kaiji was shocked by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was set up with large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Emono", and "3-Step Cruun", making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every trick in the book, eventually sinking the ground and tilting the building with a vinyl tank, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no "4000 yen per ball" and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held as a pastime by the wealthy, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in a "human horse race" across a steel girder.
The debtors race along a thin steel girder set 10 meters above the ground, carefully avoiding falling off while competing for speed.
Twelve people participated, with the top two able to win a prize, but there were only four steel beams and inadequate safety measures, making the risk of death quite high.
Although this rope-way is highly dangerous, it can be experienced in a very similar way at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", which was also developed as a VR game.
This Eagle Bridge is a single iron bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and ahead of it are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which can be reached by walking.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koarashi Koraru released a video on his YouTube channel of him walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming it was an experience that could be had in Japan, which became a topic of conversation.
E-Card is a two-player card game.
The game is played with 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into two sides, the Emperor side and the Slave side.
This game was very well made, with the Emperor being strong against the citizens, the citizens being strong against the slaves, and the slaves being strong against the Emperor.
In the movie, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
After a long and hard battle, Kaiji realized that his opponent was reading his mind through a device that was attached to his ears, which detected changes in his pulse and body temperature. In order to confuse his opponent, Rinkai, Kaiji shaved his ears to the extreme and caused abnormal values in his body, eventually leading to his victory.
The E-card is available for purchase and can be bought on Amazon.
Popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video on YouTube where he competed against actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji, using E-cards, and it became a topic of conversation.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
See how you feel about the game's atmosphere throughout the game.
Taking the first step into the new year, the Yamagata Shimbun kindly encourages people to visit the prefectural shrine and write a New Year's wish on the large horse-shaped votive tablet.
At Yamagata Prefecture's Shinkokusai Shrine, which is preparing for the New Year, a large votive horse of the zodiac sign of the coming year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, a group of students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to create the original drawings for the ema since the year before last.
Nine students from the Japanese Painting Course, led by Professor Suehara Toshiaki, were chosen, and Yuichi Tsuchiya (22) was selected for his work.
The large-scale tapestry is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at its center.
Tsuchiya said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
The sight of the fox standing still and admiring the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish that even in a rapidly changing world, one could still find the time to appreciate the beauty of nature.
Tsuchiya's design is also featured on the omamori charms that are distributed to the public.
Gonenki's Kenichi Chiba (44) said, "I think it will be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Living Tamano" - Four high school students in the city hold a workshop to make proposals: San-Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital.
What is the town of Tamano like in 2030?
The student representatives from the four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai-zukuri Center, a mid-support organization, they will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor.
What makes you happy?
In response to the facilitator's question, the students answered in unison, such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns with a sense of purpose" while traveling to each island with a predetermined theme, using the "World Cafe" method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a bulletin board.
"It seems like a fun town with lots of young people." "Public transportation like trains and buses is essential for convenience."
Let's talk further to see if we can find any common ground.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said 18-year-old Tamano Commercial High School student.
The 18-year-old students from Binan High School noticed the charm of the area, not just the local issues, as they talked with adults about how there are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but the area is rich in nature.
In the second meeting of December, the high school students gathered to organize the proposals.
They plan to announce it next February with the mayor and the superintendent in attendance.
The president of the East Rie Center said, "We hope to foster a sense of local pride among high school students and provide them with an opportunity to be actively involved in community development."

According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0 on the Richter scale.
There is no concern about a tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake varies by location.
The earthquake registered a magnitude of 4 in Kuki, Kasama Ishii (Ibaraki), Adachi Taisho (Tochigi), Kiryu Motosu (Gunma), Ota Nishi-machi (Saitama), Kasa (Saitama), etc., and a magnitude of 3 in Mito (Ibaraki), Utsunomiya (Tochigi), Maebashi Horikoshi (Gunma), Kawagoe Shinjuku (Saitama), Chiba Hanamigawa (Chiba), Otemachi (Tokyo), Tsurumi Suehiro (Kanagawa), etc., and a magnitude of 2 in Koriyama Konan (Fukushima), Hitachi (Ibaraki), Kanuma (Tochigi), Takasaki (Gunma), etc.

How to Find the New Way of Storing (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Don't you sometimes feel the fabric of your scarf bunching up around your neck in the winter?
I often hear people say that they don't quite know how to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after tying the scarf.
I was thinking that if I could find a wrap that wouldn't wrinkle and could be put on quickly, then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece, with the fabric cut into long, thin strips, creating a net-like pattern.
The mesh of the net has been designed to allow the ball to pass through.
Therefore, it can be wound and secured without connecting the ends.
It is made of fleece material and is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless vests (or blazers) are popular, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is really interesting.
Get Buck is a movie directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels like a raw, life-sized Beatles experience, with lots of freshness...
Even though it's right before the band breaks up, it's not as dramatic as I had imagined it to be.
While trying to keep everyone in line, he had to deal with Paul, who was always complaining about how annoying he was, George, who was always grumbling and John, who was always late and not very motivated, as well as the laid-back Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a troubled look on his face.
We weren't really that much in disagreement, but there was a very familiar feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had the same kind of atmosphere in their legendary breakup or whatever you want to call it.
Despite the tension, when the performance began, everyone was overflowing with talent.
The process of creating a hit song from a simple phrase, where both of them are asking each other "how about this?", is amazing.
Especially the moment when the song "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
The scene of a subtle hum gradually turning into a catchy "Zucha♪ Zucha♪" with lyrics was recorded perfectly.
It's amazing that we can see the process of composition like this.
Of course, everyone is having a great time, so just watching the performance can make you feel happy.
So far, it seems like only one episode of the three has aired, but my impression is that the main cause of the Beatles' break-up was more the environment around them than the band itself.
Despite their bickering, they seemed to enjoy making music together, but when it came to finding a place to perform, the producer and other promoters would start talking in a Beatles-like manner about how they should be the best in the world, and it was clear that the band members had no control over the situation.
Well, since documentaries involve the director's interpretation, it's possible that Peter Jackson felt that way, but...
I thought that might be because Paul is supervising, so there are a lot of scenes where Paul seems to be the villain.

I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I was not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but when I switched to a different industry and started doing sales activities that were requested by customers, I found it much easier to work.
Even though I was criticized for not being able to do something, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, it will make my life going forward a little bit easier.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and relax before considering this.
I think there is also daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial doctor, or a consultation window, it may be better to consult there, as there may be some system.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have caused major damage in the United States due to the unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold air influenced by weather news.
From Friday night to Saturday, tornadoes broke out across the southern United States.
The strong cold air moving south caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, leading to the rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds due to the record-breaking warmth for this time of year.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the American South, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperatures on Thursday and Friday are expected to reach near 30°C.
Due to the strong cold air descending from around 5500m in the sky, a large temperature difference formed and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front line, resulting in a record-breaking warm temperature.
It appears that a series of tornadoes have occurred in the area.
The American South is an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in the winter season reached nearly 150 times in one day, which was a record-breaking number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and strong winds on Friday, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that an EF3 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached the third strongest level out of six, with instantaneous winds of around 70 m/s.
Future investigations may determine that it was an EF4-5 tornado.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese Enhanced Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita Scale and adapted to the conditions of Japanese buildings.
The JEF3 tornado, equivalent to the one in the US, is likely to occur in Japan as well, and it is at a level where wooden houses can collapse.

New Game
According to the Daily Sports, there were cries for help from the "biggest ever" snowstorm in history during the live broadcast.
On Sunday (Japan time Monday), President Biden expressed his view of the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States as "one of the largest tornadoes in US history" with a solemn expression.
According to reports from CNN and other US television networks.
Biden emphasized that the federal government will do "everything in its power".
He explained that the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the death toll could exceed 100.
At least 30 tornadoes struck six states, including Kentucky, from the evening of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, causing damage to homes and forcing residents to carry furniture and other belongings out of the broken houses.
The record of the damage range of the tornado is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) which caused damage to Missouri in 1925, but a meteorologist from CNN estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers), making it the largest scale.
In the town of Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas season also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were employed there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
Trapped under a thick pile of rubble in the darkness, the woman was unable to move and felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her. She then asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In the live broadcast that was released, there were cries of help from a woman, as well as the sound of a woman singing "Happy Birthday To You" while crying, seemingly to distract from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk from Mayfield, took shelter in her basement with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was unharmed.
He looked back and said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, like something was erupting."
The police officer from the Mayfield Police Department stated that the search will continue until it is no longer necessary.
He continued the rescue effort, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, at least six people have been confirmed dead after a warehouse belonging to internet retail giant Amazon collapsed.
The train derailed due to the shock of being separated from its carriages, and highways have been closed due to the effects of overturned vehicles.
According to US media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What can I do to increase it?
Consume high-protein foods and drinks.
Avoid rough-cut vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

It's tough to get by without welfare...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be nice to have a job like a hotel or resort that allows you to live in and secure both an address and an income source, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I did a quick search and found this website below.
Live-in Part-time and Full-time Job - Live-in Job Navi (Suminavi)
My colleagues seem to think that there are a lot of people looking for jobs with "as-is" live-in arrangements, based on the related searches.
With bank accounts and line contracts, it's possible to get them set up with just an address for the first time, but with credit cards (and debit cards that can be used as credit cards), you can't update them without an address (since a new card is sent to the registered address).

There has been a long-standing belief that there are different ways of thinking about star rating systems.
While other countries base their scoring system on five stars, Japan claims to use three stars as a neutral point, adding or subtracting points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a two-star difference, and four stars mean something completely different - "there are elements that detract from the score" and "not a masterpiece, but a good work".
If we base our ratings on a five-star system, then a work with no flaws is on the same level as a work of the highest quality, so if that's the trend, then it's a system flaw not to present the meaning of the stars, but since that system is being used and such operations are being carried out, I understand why you don't want to give it three stars (bad review).
Therefore, trying to refute those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a two-choice rating system on Steam would not make sense.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fits the standard size of a hose?
The power capacity from USB is 5V and up to 2A, so it is only 10W at most.
No matter what kind of water pump you use, it will at least consume 500W of power, so it's impossible.

Winding up a homemade radio
I made an AM radio with my own condenser and coil, but there was too much noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was tuned to a different frequency than the one I was expecting.
The tuning might have been too soft so it didn't sound clear, but it was different from what we expected.
The main issue here is that I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
I wonder why? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the ESPs for SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?

I understand the risks, so I'm not planning on actually doing it, but I can't stop thinking about it and I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, please let me know if it is okay to do.
Thank you for your post.

<Saga Eating Log> "Hakobune" Fried Fish and Shrimp Fried with Freshly Caught Fish from the Nearby Sea and Homemade Tartar Sauce | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box with freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fries, homemade tartar sauce.
"Hakobune" is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli dishes with plenty of vegetables.
The couple, Takayuki Kousaku (39) and Yumi (38), opened their restaurant last August with the goal of providing customers with a restaurant-like experience at home.
One of the popular bento box menu items is "Freshly-caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available in the market at the time.
Kiyoshi said that the batter for the fried food is made as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be felt, and the texture of the shrimp fried food can be directly felt.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of rice with mixed grains and locally-grown Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture, and a soup.
He bought vegetables from his own field next to the house and from local direct sales stores.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western flavors that provide a familiar and comforting taste, like rolled omelette (Yumi-san), that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
The popular bento box "Hand-kneaded Domestic Mixed Meat Hamburg Steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also be selling charcuterie sets to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I decided to try out the interesting things I found at Haneda Airport on a whim.
Ride comfort - not too bad, but it can be a bit bumpy (not enough to make you feel sick).
Naturally, it's slow.
I think it was safe because I slowed down and sometimes stopped completely when there were people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It's painful to be watched by people around me; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're getting in the way and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it was not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be best to create a dedicated lane so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it was a great ride since I could take my time and enjoy the scenery without feeling rushed.
It was a thrilling ride with a futuristic feeling of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the surrounding gaze was pleasant, but it was a difficult ride for those who are not very patient.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you can see that there is no eel used in this bowl of rice.
The answer is "Nuts!" (Tap to reveal the answer!)
I thought that everyone was just eating eel with sauce, so I thought that anything other than the grilling would be fine, but then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want the eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
The recipe used: Eggplant “Unagi” - Woks of Life (with chili pepper instead of scallions).

On December 12th, a man was slashed by another man on a motorcycle in Otsuji, Saga City, in an attempted murder.
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Otsu-cho, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and the Saga South Police Station is pursuing him in connection with an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Station, a 110 call was made by a passerby reporting a fight.
The man sustained a wound about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man was said to have been drinking with several acquaintances, and police are investigating what appears to have been a traffic altercation between the pedestrian and the biker.

A Family's Long Journey to Establish Environmental Protection Activities on the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
China, with its vast land area, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities, but also support the activities of environmental activists.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna) in Southwest China is also one of these regions.
Li Wanda, the younger sister, is currently an actress. The Sipsongpanna region is located on the border between Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) people who share a common ancestry with the Thai kingdom.
The source of the Mekong River flows through various countries in Southeast Asia.
Despite covering only 0.2% of China's total area, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna is home to about 25% of the country's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Li Min-guo in Seychelles and hear about his environmental protection activities.
She has been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years, starting with her German husband.
What was the catalyst for that?
Lee, our environmental protection campaign "Tianzi" has been active since 2000.
The catalyst for this was my husband, Josef Margraf.
Her husband came to Ciudad del Este for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China, as he is originally from Germany.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and is renowned for its rich biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest took place in order to establish industries in the area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
He was sent here from Germany to help with the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
I then got to know and married a journalist I met here.
Did Mr. Lee have any interest in conservation before that?
I am from Cispanana, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
As a result, she had to push the project forward without any knowledge of it with her husband.
Why do you think some people have an aura even though they don't have a perfect face or an especially tall stature?

Is it something like praising in detail?
What would you do if Yoko Homma confessed her love to you?

It took me about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in my MOD environment, which was a personal note.
Until March, the data was stable, but around GW, I couldn't play much and multiple CTDs occurred due to various factors. It took a long time to identify them since I could only investigate a little bit during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes are not recorded in the crash logs.
Main Timing of CTD
All Papyrus and .Net Script Framework, .dll plug-ins of the logging type will not leave a trace in the logs.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activated by console kill as well → Improved by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) *Is there a possibility of wet clothing in this?
Camera work for activating kill moves against NPCs has been improved by setting the PC kill move setting to OFF via .ini, resolving conflicts between DAR and Nemesis settings. However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animation numbers.
While moving around the field and using some magic (e.g. Ice Rune), when hitting NPCs: all settings of Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID usage for NPCs (top right of MCM) should be turned off and try 5 times in a row to improve everything.
Could this be due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although the 2.0 SPID default.ini has a formatting mistake, it should still result in the intended outcome and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perks applied.
Initially, we focused on checking motion/combat mods (.dlls) related to area attacks and OnHit effects, and this is the result we got.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French language levels.
If there are any people in a Japanese environment who have the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful to post this as a reference in case it helps.
Everyone was pushing themselves to the limit mentally.
Nobody around him noticed, not even his colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that even though that person looks like they're having a hard time, they're still working hard.
He was probably on the brink of mental exhaustion.
I haven't officially retired yet, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - after today's visit is finished
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I have been able to build a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Today's home visit made me realize how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication, in addition to the necessary medication management (such as packaging).
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and had a good laugh.
We also talk about topics such as male and female sexual desire, why she got divorced, and whether it's appropriate to discuss such things in home visits.
Occasionally, I have dressed up as a woman.
I have heard from a friend that in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or a visiting nurse with a physical therapist who gives orders in a condescending manner, saying "We are providing medical care here".
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really great because they face me, who has a mental illness, on an equal footing and frankly.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits, and there may be people who are considering receiving them.
Home visits from nurses can be very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to terminate contracts because the terms were not agreeable to me.
I'm sorry for the poor writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was still startled when it came up in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several possible causes, for example...
I don't know what it will be displayed as in Japanese by the creator.
Language recognition malfunction

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government released a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
By 2022, it was planned to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (about 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles has not reached the target of 27% (approximately 17,000 vehicles).
The target for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places), and the price per kilogram of hydrogen is 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target.
On December 12th, the National Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core materials of fuel cell vehicles, such as carbon fiber supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA), are supplied by various companies.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% annually since 2014.
South Korea is ranked fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells from 2014 to 2020.
However, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hydrogen reported that "in effect, six countries dominate the world hydrogen market, meaning that the rest are actually at a disadvantage."
The country-wise patent ranking is China, USA, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, when China overtook the United States to become the world's largest economy, the gap between them has been widening.
In 2020, South Korea registered 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to become the fourth largest, but still lagging behind China (4,721 patents) at 22%.
The All-Japan Federation proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax deduction for investment and research and development expenses.

Do you get paid for volunteering?
There are some people who mistakenly believe that volunteering must be done for free.

Was the number of female wives during the Meiji and Showa eras much smaller compared to now?
I think my sister had many wives.
The phrase "sister-in-law wife" has become popular enough to be used in everyday conversations.
Back then, it was said that a man should search for a wife even if it meant wearing a golden sandal, so I think there were more older wives in the Meiji and Showa eras than there are now.

The high prices for the PS5 are due to its rarity and the fact that it is worth more than its original price.

Tentacle monsters are a popular genre in the West.

It's kind of irrelevant, but this kind of topic comes up regularly and the answer is always the same: "Wow, the sales from Japan are really impressive!" Honestly, it's getting a bit old.

While the Takasu City Council is undergoing reform, the "Communication Book" of the members is also available on the Hokkaido Shimbun Doushin Electronic Edition in the form of a TV program-style flyer.
The town council of Taka-su is undertaking unique reforms to their council, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate their council members.
The town council election is aiming for three consecutive terms of no votes in order to gain the interest of the townspeople.
On the 9th, 1800 copies of a new flyer were distributed through newspaper inserts to inform people about the Sunday Assembly on the 12th.
"Asa Kara Ningen Giron", "Tetsuko no Heya", "Sawaguchi Hito Tantei Series"...
The flyers distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy phrases reminiscent of popular TV shows.
Hyoe Katayama, the 43-year-old lawmaker created by the party, said, "I want to come to the Diet with a smile on my face."

The US has delivered weapons and ammunition to Ukraine and will also be involved in training troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News.
U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance package approved by President Biden by December 12.
The military aid package is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine after the New Year.
According to the Pentagon's Kirby spokesman, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of troops by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance over Russian military movements, consulting with NATO member countries, and discussing possible responses in case Russia invades Ukraine.
In September of this year, President Biden approved military aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military also participated in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the state sent National Guard troops to Florida in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational security.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, during which a tense exchange of views on the situation in Ukraine took place.
The United States has also indicated that it will impose severe economic sanctions if an attack occurs.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hand" of lifetime gifts, directly hitting former LDP Tax Commission Chairman Masaru Amari!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is called "Advance Inheritance by Inter Vivos Gift".
While discussions on the integration of inheritance and gift taxes are ongoing, the proposed tax reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year was not included, but there is a high possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to former LDP Tax Commission Chairman, Kanemaru, he will impart everything from basic tax and inheritance techniques to tax-saving techniques to make it in time for the year-end rush of gifts and inheritance.
Edited by Keiaki Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department
From wealthy individuals to city employees, the government is looking to build a neutral tax system to capture inheritance and gift taxes more holistically, and to discourage the use of "forbidden hands" for pre-death gifts.
The announcement of the 2021 tax reform outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance among not only the wealthy but also the middle class.
This is because it means to change the rules of inheritance and make "gifts before death" - a common inheritance tax measure - a "forbidden hand" in order to increase inheritance taxes.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is to reduce the taxable property.
This powerful estate planning tool has been widely used by wealthy individuals, as well as by employees with smaller estates who may incur a small inheritance tax in the three major metropolitan areas where they own a home.
The discussion of integrating inheritance and gift taxes that suddenly arose.
Although the December 10th announcement of the 22-year tax reform outline was concerned about the fastest introduction, it was once again proposed to unify the direction with more detailed wording such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
Former LDP Tax System Research Committee Chairman, Atsushi Amari, former Secretary-General, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to ensure that the tax burden is the same regardless of when the transfer of assets takes place, without losing any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from the integration, and if the amendment is passed quickly, there will be three chances left for lifetime gifts.
It seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken towards invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will the rules for inheritance and gift taxes change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022.
The movie is based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, and is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamayagi Kajun.
College student Riso meets his senior at his part-time job, Kairi.
Kaili, who is suffering from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has similar features to her estranged brother, but is Kairi a murderer due to a certain incident?
Furukawa Yudai commented, "The drama 'My Righteous Older Brother' will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!"
For those who have not seen FOD yet, please look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I hope you can understand the complex psychological portrayal of Kari and Riseto, as well as their struggles and changes, and gain a deeper understanding of this work.
I am happy if fans of the original work can also enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

What did the players of the NFL team that won with only three passes feel and how? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in this game.
This was only the second time in the past 50 years of the NFL, since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had an unprecedented talent in running back O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to surpass 2,000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another running back, Jim Brownston.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offensive strategy this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, with a latitude similar to Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s and snowfall before the game.
The Bills, being the home team, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
He ran 25 times for 30 passes.
Allen's passing stats were 15/30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions and it was certainly not a bad performance.
The offense had four red zone trips in ten series and had opportunities to score.
In particular, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row from the end of the third quarter.
However, they only managed to score three points in three attempts with a field goal.
Goal-line defense in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills attempted to make up the 4-point deficit, but committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd and 14, quarterback Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense and rolled out of the pocket to the right.
He then threw a pass intended for tight end Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it was unsuccessful.
On the play, Ace WR Stefon Diggs ran a slant route and was open in the end zone, but it seemed to have not registered with Allen.
On fourth-and-18, Allen targeted wide receiver Gabriel Davis running left outside the end zone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots defensive back Miles Bryant, ending the play in failure.
Bryant was covering Bills WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw two passes into the end zone in an attempt to score.
The fourth down pass may have been a Hail Mary, but there was no need to go for a touchdown on the third down.
They need to get two first downs in two plays.
With two minutes left, it would have been wise to put the ball in Allen's hands, as he had the ability to run or pass the ball on fourth and short.

It's time to replace the items you've been keeping in your kitchen for a long time. Here are three items to consider, according to Harper's BAZAAR.
Sponge
Even if you change it frequently, it's likely that the sponge is not replaced as often as recommended.
According to research in 2017, it has been found that even if kitchen sponges are disinfected in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate (although it is still recommended to disinfect them in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that cutting boards should be replaced when they become scratched or grooved.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, allowing bacteria to proliferate.
If it's still safe to use, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, then pat dry with a clean paper towel or air dry naturally.
Broken or chipped dishes.
It may be painful to get rid of your favorite mug, but the broken surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also be the cause of chapped lips and spilled drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Of course, there's no way we're practicing underwater bridge three times! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and lock them in a cage!

Community markets and trades are two different things.
At the community market, you can use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows people to make cash transactions with strangers, which can lead to scams where people are left with only the item and no money paid.
That won't happen.
Trading is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Are occupation and employment type a different topic?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even in simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even in intellectual labor.
Help me finish flashing the BIOS.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings page once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed on without blinking.
Even when I tried to rewrite the BIOS by using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS was corrupted, it wouldn't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about five minutes to finish, but it won't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be an old USB memory stick or using an SD card converted for use.
Is Tomahawk oversleeping?
Could there be any other similar causes?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I knew him.
He always had a stoic expression on his face.
I wasn't disliked or anything.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have designer items.
I can carry something inconspicuous, but I can't carry something like a Louis Vuitton with a monogram and the letters "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it would be nice in Japan.
In Japan, it is .
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
I should have said it earlier, "Why are you talking to me so casually/rudely?"
It would be best to simply say that it is unpleasant if someone suggests that it doesn't matter because they are foreign.
I don't think I ever dreamed of having an uncomfortable feeling with a somewhat decent probability.
When I was living abroad, I noticed that the Japanese people who went out there didn't like the Confucian rules and regulations, and there were quite a few people who had the wrong idea that they could say whatever they wanted to the locals.
If it looks like Westerners, I think they do it without any malice, as a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling.
When I talk in Japanese, I sometimes get a bit confused about whether to use the first or last name of my friends who are from Europe and the US, even though I usually call them by their first name.
Well, it's okay if they're friends.
I'm just doing it normally, but if I don't say something now, it might be too late to stop it from being treated as an exception because it's being overlooked as if it's a gaijin.
Can you talk to me in Japanese rules because this is Japan?
Incidentally, my white friend who is naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others when we toast at parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person, so that I'm not treated strangely by people older or younger than me.
Japanese people, regardless of personality, are so detail-oriented that there are a lot of annoying people (including me) who look at those small things.

I have only a limited ability to understand English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of grammar, but I understand what is trying to be conveyed and I think it is at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I just feel this way, so it would be good to ask others as well).
I often see translations of this quality in games made overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like they are usually well-translated.
I think it takes a long time of studying for non-native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people won't feel uncomfortable with, I suggest looking for someone else.

The analysis is that training in "Demon Slayer" is the battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration of the Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga series "Demon Slayer" stand out among recent shonen manga is the emphasis on training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles and the characters train day and night, is not popular among readers.
This can also be inferred from the fact that in the same manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates separated for two years of training, only the beginning was drawn out, while the rest was quickly skipped over.
Well, one-piece suits are attractive for their eccentricity in wandering lands, but sometimes they don't go well with "staying in the same place and training".
The training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who was trying to take his life, and Giyu said to him, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, only to be forced down by the strong with power alone...
Despite this, he introduced Rin Takuma, the "trainer" who trains the applicants for the Demon Slayer Corps, as a sign of his kindness (even though he is not good at communicating his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and Tanjiro was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied "You're too slow to make a decision."
It was a seemingly unfair exchange that has become the stuff of legend among fans.
However, taking his sister out while she is in her possessed state carries the potential for a moment where he will be forced to make a difficult decision.
It could be said that this is an initiation into training from a mental standpoint.
Rin Tazuke, an inexperienced novice, was taken to Semigami Mountain and told to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain was full of pitfalls, air pockets, catapults, and traps, making it seem like death before even beginning the training.
Despite this, he was able to detect the faint smell of a trap set by someone else with his sharp sense of smell and barely managed to avoid it, which became known as the "hero's correction".
Even so, it seems that the essence of Demon Slayer is to make Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so much more physically capable just because of that!"
Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any support, and awakening is just using the power and skills that have been honed to their full potential.
The "Law of Equivalent Exchange", which states that those who put in effort will be rewarded accordingly and those who do not put in effort will not be rewarded, is a human anthem that differs from the supernatural power of a god with no basis, and is a difficult rule to follow consistently throughout the work.
Is this old?
He still sleeps without a bed, laying a mattress directly on the floor and using a futon and quilt.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
It is better to sleep on a futon than a bed if you want to use the room space efficiently.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is that frustrating?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time to juggle multiple jobs?
No, not particularly.
In this case, it doesn't fit my definition of "gutsy".
I think of "gemetui" as trying to get more benefit than effort with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its CE and IM divisions into a single set division, named DX (Device eXperience), the company announced on December 12th that it will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.

Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Forum to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people of other faiths, in recent years it has become more common to use the abbreviation BCE.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

I would like a more heavy and serious expression.
They lie in wait, their armored heads barely visible above the sand, ready to spear and drag down anything that stumbles into their trap.
The Hanmio larvae always lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey, showing only their disc-shaped head above the sand.
This feels a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the Hanyou wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be that way.
What's worrying is...
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from Ali's perspective?
Is that so?
Translating "armoured heads" as "circular heads" would make the part about "a giant monster wearing a helmet in ant scale" disappear.
24 vehicles collided in Aichi Prefecture, with the truck driver having no pre-existing conditions; it is suspected to be due to carelessness (TV Asahi ANN) - Yahoo! News
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident involving 24 cars in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, had no pre-existing illness and that it is believed that some kind of carelessness caused the accident.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Katsuyasu Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer driven by the suspect, Nomura, continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura had no pre-existing condition and it appears that some kind of negligence was the cause.
The police are searching the premises and investigating the circumstances in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the first volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals, this volume focuses on a single battle and is packed with new gimmicks!
"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman wrestling starts even before the match begins!
In a nutshell, this four-volume series is a detailed and careful depiction of the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it is important to note that it is not just a story about the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, the tug-of-war competition and the special training scenes are quite different from before, but it's never boring.
The tension of the beginning of the century-long battle gradually increases in the story, which certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and it is amazing that even this period is a carefully calculated production.
Before the big final, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the battle for third place between Teriman and Ramenman.
What I love about the matchup is not only its grandeur as a card, but also the pre-match scene backstage where Ramenman shouted "Now it's my turn to take charge!!" towards a Kinnikuman poster.
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, caught the sword and stopped it, and the two of them stared at each other silently before parting ways without a word.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, so they won't have any more chances to fight each other in this tournament.
But there is a lot of controversy surrounding this Kinnikuman character.
Seeing this, I can't help but think of his future successes!
As a manga artist, it is still a scene that makes me feel deeply that this is what it means for a character to stand up!
The battle between the two ended without much time left, but the highlight of the game was the post-game appeal of the Ramen Man's tears.
Don't underestimate the power of divine luck in Kinnikuman!
That's the line.
This could be seen as a grand statement about the work itself, as readers have come to understand that the protagonist of Kinnikuman will ultimately never lose, and that he has been winning in some way despite not having the greatest strength.
But by allowing Ramenman to make this statement, Yudetamago-sensei preemptively drove home the point that this move was no longer an option.
With this one sentence, the reader wonders, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman will actually defeat Robin with his own strength?"
How did he do it?
It will surely stimulate our imagination with the unpredictable development, and from a writer's perspective, this is like a self-imposed restriction on the creator of the work.
Wow, that was amazing!
I'm sure this is one of the biggest points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend to be held at Aobayama in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba-yama Herbal Village in Takahama-cho Nakayama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is surrounded by gentle lights.
On December 12th, the winter illumination that began on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along with a promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture were surprised to find such a place when they came to Fukui after a long time.
He said it was beautiful and it was a relief.
Illumination was first planned to provide a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit up from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there will be a Christmas event with button pot activities and a movie screening.

The Yamagata Shimbun is broadcasting live from Yonezawa, with the Ochikatsu Agricultural Promotion Association providing PR for agricultural and livestock products.
On the 11th, the Okitsu Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JAs in the Okitsu region, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which distributes products while streaming video over the internet.
Tokyo's Minato Ward initiated the nationwide collaboration "Minato Market TV", and the Yamagata Aioi Bujotai group made a remote appearance to deliver the appeal of the region along with its special products.
The "Okita-Minato Kaikou Project", a collaboration between the Okita area and the Port District, has resulted in a store opening, which was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranew-machi, Yonezawa City.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power to my NAS PC has gone out! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The PC was powered on at this time.
When I returned to the room a few minutes later, I noticed a sound coming from the PC like a pink rotor and immediately shut it down.
At this point, it was thought that the fans' movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So they decided to warm up the room and try again.
Not starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will briefly turn on and the fan will start to move, but it will soon stop.
He said nothing afterwards.
Even after unplugging the power cord and trying again, the connection only lasted for a moment.
I tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX 20-pin and 4-pin, and removing all other parts, but it still wouldn't boot up.
Previously, PSU fans have heard a "boom boom boom boom" sound, leading some to suspect that PSU may be the cause.
I will try to find an extra ATX power supply and test it out later.
Maybe.
What should I do if it doesn't work?
Should we change it together with Case and Mother?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last four to five years?
Where did you see it?
Is it surrounded by nature?
I live in the Tohoku region.
There are places like this all around my neighborhood.

I hope he keeps that style.
