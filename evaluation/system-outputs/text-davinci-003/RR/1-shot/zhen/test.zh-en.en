Zhejiang University Academic Conference Student Sings Lead Role, Research Results Open Up Brain Holes - Xinhua News
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of creative academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Checkup Doctor
Zhang Diming's doctoral team from the Biomedical Engineering Institute demonstrated an on-site intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to take a breath and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of the breath you exhale.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, a health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, as its target. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: High-Energy Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Inventions Exhibition in this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up a new thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
Many diseases are related to early detection and inadequate excision, as well as the lights used in doctors' operating rooms.
Shen Junfei said that if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadowless rate according to the operation needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air Handwashing: Save Water and Be Cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand washing device".
As soon as we step onto the device, our weight will compress the air out of the sink.
Like a cheerleader.
Compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with water.
Now we can get our hands clean!
Colorimetric response and bacterial residual tests prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, this invention stood out among many world-leading universities at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit and won the only gold medal.

A Meaningful Certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid is actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency aid.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes of the window of life, the golden four minutes!
So it's important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, we have official data that three million people die from accidents every year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous.
On average, 15% can be saved nationwide in the United States.
"Seventy-eight percent of the casinos and hotels in Las Vegas can be saved, but less than one percent in Shanghai and Beijing."
This is what the founding father Lu Le said first.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, is not breathing, and has no pulse, chest compressions are not effective.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be done in order to have a chance of saving someone.
I find that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
It might even save a life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
The last picture is a record of goals to be achieved before I turn 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
I'm going to take other certificates I want to take next, and I'm planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Only 13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling!?
I have never tried.
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# only sent me one shrimp dumpling to eat?!
I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
I personally believe that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie in all aspects.
But you can't say that the movie isn't a highlight, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching it, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han really has a gift for insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a creature from a cliche novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you might suspect there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find it's just a pile of crap.
I'll briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small gang of Island Riders easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around could not be found.
This foreshadowing is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and a criminal suspicion become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't the character in the movie report the usury when the police asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then has to resort to sleeping outside the room door because they can't find the hotel manager?
This bizarre plot is littered throughout the movie, and the memories of it are so outlandish that they make me cringe when I recall them.
Worse than the plot, or rather the lack thereof, is the movie's message, or rather the lack of one, making it an abominable patchwork.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy, but 20 minutes later you might guess it's a motivational film, halfway through you might think it's a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, and after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by deep doubt about why you went to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are already familiar with the tropes of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
Such as the new motorcycle that Yoon Jung-yeon's character burned and still managed to sing, we can't go and open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female lead obviously not being mentally challenged yet acting like a 5 year old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's request.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to give the audience a headache?

Chongqing Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Program - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, 60 vocational schools in our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model. Students accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded by pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees be clarified, and a three-party agreement be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises according to the principle of two-way selection. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific post, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentice on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent cultivation model.
Jointly design a talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot adopts a pilot cycle of cultivating the system, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the talent cultivation program. The top-post internship is generally 6 months.
Enterprises should implement team-based management models in practice, and according to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot program having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
Explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises according to the principle of "trial before implementation and gradual progress from point to surface", so as to effectively improve students' job skills, increase the employment rate and quality of students.

South African Doctors: Omecamivir has strong transmission, but mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a 5,000-plus doctor organization in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are milder, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pierre said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta cases, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of recent COVID-19 hospitalizations were severe cases, half of the proportion of the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 cases have died, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "All indications currently point to this being a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only have two weeks into this wave of the pandemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delata still being the main coronavirus strain globally, cases of the Omikron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Hauden Province increased by 400%, with tests showing that the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Commentary: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we apply the famous public service slogan "No buying, no killing" to this situation, then in a good environment without demand for trafficking, collective prevention and public anti-trafficking will make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app "Tuan Yuan", I feel a warm sense of togetherness.
New technological means not only have a name of "artistic" and full of sentiment, but also are properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to locate and recover trafficked children and protect their safety and freedom.
Secondly, comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
Prior to the breaking of the trafficking case, attention should be given to the personal safety of the victims first.
In urgent cases of rescue, controversial topics such as "Should child trafficking be punished by death penalty" can be put aside for careful discussion, but the rescue of abducted children must not be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, traffickers usually leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in a child abduction case increases the difficulty of solving the case and the distance between the child and their parents.
In this case, taking practical action such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a wise move.
After all, "eradicating abduction" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
Combating crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Furthermore, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a considerable level of protection awareness.
Taking turns to rest or placing the child in a safe and secure environment are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of police crackdown on trafficking, the buyers of trafficked children should also be looked at and punished.
One single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of five years imprisonment; for particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
Under the trend of "leniency", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the crimes with heavier punishment, with the starting point of punishment being high and the maximum punishment being heavy.
There are still many cases of human trafficking happening every year to this day.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
Effective control of trafficking in persons cannot be achieved solely through strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" of trafficking is widely present, traffickers are driven by greed and constantly innovate their methods of trafficking, forming a "cat and mouse" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking efforts will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of child trafficking and buying.
Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Malan Mountain.
Draw strength from the Party's hundred-year struggle history
According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, a standing member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Ma'anshan Video and Cultural Park on the morning of December 10 to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects: ideal faith and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leadership and party theory, to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the conference and the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on Hunan Province, the spirit of the provincial party committee, and learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action awareness of "two establishment" and "two maintenance", and unswervingly move forward in the direction of General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples.

I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.
No receipts on the bag.
Uninvestigatable
I hope you all understand.
The delivery was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
No, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been processing.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil) with five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as cold-pressed olive oil, is a fat obtained from fresh olives by mechanical cold-pressing and filtering to remove impurities.
Three levels according to different acidity levels
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
Delicious taste with a delicate plant aroma and acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavor, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades.
Refined Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil, to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from the pomace by solvent extraction.
You should have noticed from the grading system that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
Just like grapes used for winemaking, olives from different regions and varieties produce different grades of olive oil.
Best Growing Areas for Olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main Production Areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others with similar climates, as well as far-south countries such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Olive Harvesting Months:
From March to June each year, olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the harvesting season for fruits (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Components of Olive Oil
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
Biden Declares the Flame of Freedom Will Never Be Extinguished as Democratic Summit Concludes
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that plans are in place to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan's government representative, Executive Councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I have said before, that a democratic world is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
"Dictatorships can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and in every corner of the globe."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole.
He said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and a force against authoritarianism, and those who would brazenly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the Democratic Summit focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also stated that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of China's ethnic minorities, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans, in Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Ronald Reagan also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
This is why we failed.
This is also the reason we must change.
At a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister of Governmental Affairs Tang Feng delivered a "National Statement" via video, emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used public health and collective interests as an excuse to justify the violation of human rights, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
In Taiwan, we don't need to lock down to control the epidemic, and we don't need to take down to defeat fake news.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
The restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
#NUMBER#
I'm not calling anymore.
I'm not eating.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
I've been waiting for you so long.
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
The meal has been waiting for an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find something similar at a similar price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level" shots are actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold up, and it is difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext is - tennis is so hard, knowing you can't learn it, and knowing you don't want to buy expensive ones, so let's make a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so this racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come to me to buy expensive things, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one can be bought for 500-600 yuan, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan. Wouldn't it be great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
It's friendly to newbies, but it's a letdown after the newbie stage, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the newbie stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could you please help follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
So I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Is the previous order no longer valid?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant but there were many items missing and the sesame chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order is for delivery only, there is no option for pick-up.

Actually, there are many considerations for dressing up for girls who are slightly chubby.
The skirt of a chubby girl should not be too short or too long, the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the chubby part of the thigh.
Wearing a skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Being too tall can give a person a short and chubby look.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - top, skirt, and long socks - and use different colors, it will create a slimming effect and make you look taller naturally.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. A noble and elegant black skirt is also the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Avoid giving people the impression of being overweight by not drawing attention to your legs and feet.
Tips on How to Dress Well for Slightly Chubby Girls
Petite plus-size girls should avoid wearing tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can be uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, black tights or mesh tights (the kind with fine mesh) should be worn. Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a dolman top to cover up the flaws of a plus-size girl.
Of course, there is a certain finesse to dressing a slightly plump girl in a short skirt.
A plus-sized girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
A mini skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN look for summer!
If you are an MM with a big upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous mini dress.
Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts will make you look slim, and they are suitable for chubby girls. Choose tight-fitting tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even chubby MM can try it.
Even a slightly chubby girl can dress fashionably.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
Make changes to your wardrobe and exercise more in your daily life to try and get out of the label of being a slightly overweight girl earlier😄

"It's better to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News Agency, Girl Used as Target for Sister's Fundraising
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a "target" to raise money for her sister went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
This action has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl did such an extreme act for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls Street "Archery Target" Fundraising Accused of Warning
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written in black ink with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow", and another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens have expressed sympathy for this.
We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers.
Police officers from the nearby Tianshui police station said in an interview with local media that there were two girls in their twenties, both dressed in youthful and beautiful attire.
The girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was standing by, shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Jia Li and was raising donations for her sister Jia Yan.
Since the treatment still required more than 300,000 in expenses, they could not think of a good way to raise funds, so they resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were involved, one as the target and one as the assistant, but neither of them actually shot the arrows. No one was found shooting arrows, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
The police determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of controlled weapons.
The responsible person stated, "This type of fundraising for publicity is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police officers at the station, she has left the station.

This Acer Shadow Knight gaming laptop is really good, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
Acer Predator Helios 300 is still not expensive in terms of price.
I personally think the Acer Predator Triton 500 is really good. The game performance is smooth and I can play most games with a high frame rate. My chicken dinner runs at a stable frame rate and is very smooth. LOL is a no-brainer, CSGO is also easy to handle, and most AAA games can be played.

I have been using the Acer Aspire Night Knight for two years now and it has been great value for money and of good quality!
I have recommended this product to all my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
Attractive appearance and good configuration.
I bought something for my nephew, and I was planning to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
The cost performance is quite high and the logistics is quite fast, so let's come back and review it after a while.
Brand new original, high cost-performance game laptop, with good design style, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
The child said that the computer is suitable for 3D rendering and design work, as the software has been installed and it works without any problems.
He said it was great, what I bought for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't understand just ask, recommend buying.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.
What's hot in 2021?
The Tokyo Olympics, no doubt.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can be the first in many projects and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
An article that seems to be a joke but also expresses the daily hardships of project managers, behind which is a lack of strength in current project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
The increasing number of project management practitioners who are learning to enhance their project management skills is evident from the rising number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certification applications each year.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
The increasing number of PMP certified professionals in the past 10 years indicates that more and more project managers realize that simply relying on old experiences is no longer feasible, and the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
Does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to practice them; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on; unclear member division of labor, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, poor inter-departmental assistance and communication, and difficulty in advancing the project...
For more than ten years, focusing on product innovation and R&D management, China-Sky Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of R&D key talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honor of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It brings the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
R&D Project Manager Training Camp Online Course This is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D enterprises, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training of project managers with lower costs and less investment, resulting in more efficient operations for the enterprise.
See what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only presented by the Zhongtian Huawei experts team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios for a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.

Jiexin Promotes Rational Consumption to Consumers Before Double Twelve - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" carnival nationwide network payment business transaction amount reached 17.7 trillion yuan, setting a new high compared to previous years.
The consumer craze of various discounts and coupons, eye-catching live streaming of goods, has once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, it makes people marvel at the increasing consumer power of the people, on the other hand, it also has to make us think calmly about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Ahead of the "Double Twelve" Festival, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large disparities in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve basic financial literacy.
Elderly and young people have relatively low financial literacy levels, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial institutions should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their own happy life with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In recent years, CreditEase has been continuously carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, launching innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly influence the rational consumption needs of young groups, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
As the Double Twelve approaches, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer loan misjudgment, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Always plan ahead when spending, and pay back on time according to your means.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the Saudi Arabia-led embargo on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused it of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a land, sea, and air blockade on Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing a new ambassador in Qatar from both countries.
The Gulf Arab States' resolution of differences, in order to restore relations with Qatar, is driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and major world powers on rescuing the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf States believe that it is deficient to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Under the background of the major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran not meeting the desires of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the supercar exhaust sound is the loudest in New Mountain District!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Why is it called LP700 when it costs nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit and the road tax is over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit per year and it has four-wheel drive?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either, the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means while my myvi is still accelerating to 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
Don't need to say too much about the car model, just Google it yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not be able to provide!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (But kind of cool)
Around RM1 per kilometer (drivers don't really care)
Practice getting on and off the train, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deafened after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The car is too big, it will be too narrow to park in a normal parking space, I'm afraid it will get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road (said by the editor, not related to the driver, haha)
Don't get the wrong idea, the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for their beloved car, please contact us!
More car information you don't know about, at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide
Involved in a multi-million dollar car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
That day, foreign cars crashed a million dollar 911 and a ten million dollar Chiron in just a few minutes!
You are right to look at the results!
Resonating the Spirit of the University with the Spirit of the Times - Xinhua News
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of paramount importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
Especially with the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Development of World-Class Universities and Disciplines, which demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a higher education power to a higher education strong power, it also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to make a breakthrough in a short time to join the ranks of world-class universities and disciplines, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still existing gaps?
In addition to firm goals, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is important to note that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its strengths while showcasing its individuality and uniqueness.
School characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school traditions and resource endowments of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we emphasize three characteristics in our school-running: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University-Industry-Research Cooperation System.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth from Facts and Innovation", the core values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment and Pragmatism", and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit of "Absorbing the best from the rivers and the sea, cultivating true virtue, opening up the world for the people, and building our nation" constitute the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
"Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, embodying the mentality of "using talents from all over the world"; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving moral cultivation and character tempering; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research innovation, reform and development, and innovation; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share the same destiny with the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
The wise listen to the unspoken, the enlightened see the unseen.
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the era of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, upholding humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs were quickly leaving the scene, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic beginning to earn a steady income from playing the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a total transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
Axie Infinity is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just a single role, they can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This agency is not granted by the game developer, but is secured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing the news about my friend's stock price is the choice of industry for investment targets, which is the choice of industry for investment targets. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion yuan; second, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the track being flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics is about "doing the right things", or doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
Thinking beyond how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); Thinking beyond how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); Thinking beyond how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; Thinking beyond how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua News
More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman Zhao Yukong said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been engaging in "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yu said that research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asian applicants had the lowest acceptance rate relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, with Yale University and Brown University having implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian Americans.
The three universities complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 and had previously complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the appeal was also joined by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale contract.
After several days of not being able to reach an agreement on the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was frustrated and angry when he had already paid the deposit and prepared the payment for the house he had finally chosen, but the seller refused to sell it at the last minute.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
The court found that the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and that the fault could not be attributed solely to the defendant, so it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had failed, and thus the double return of the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not be liable for the breach of double return of the deposit.
The plaintiff appealed after the first judgment.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers Reminder: Exercise due diligence in the transaction process.
As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (December 11) after the conclusion of the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, stirring up division and confrontation in the name of democracy but in fact doing the opposite, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, pursued "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
Democracy has become a 'massive weapon of destruction' for US interference in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held virtually with the participation of 111 global leaders, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have been criticisms both internationally and domestically in the US, such as the invitation of some authoritarian leaders, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, with some questioning the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing the summit, not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also participated in the virtual Democratic Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly severe. American democracy is a 'rich man's game' built on a capital base."
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be a buffer and a bulwark against authoritarianism, and those who would nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has committed to a year-long effort following the Democratic Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

Education Thinking: How University Exams Can Make Both "Geeks" and "Dummies" Get What They Deserve - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In a university campus, students come from all walks of life with different abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation varied.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming before the exam, and if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a strange situation where "academic underachievers" can pass the exams without putting in much effort, and even get high scores, while "academic overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores on exams.
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflections on the problems in university exams are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
We should give praise to the three students who wrote this letter.
In fact, it is not uncommon for university students to cram for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive for the scope of the exam, and even sneak in cheat sheets and ask teachers for special favors after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not lies more in the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be divided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
Without a doubt, whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic discipline theories and basic common sense, and from the knowledge point of view, the space of change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basics of university mathematics that were taught 20 years ago are still being taught and are still the focus."
Although the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, it does not mean that the exam questions are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject are coordinated to form the test paper. The examination marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
To design a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level are also needed, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of abilities, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education, and whatever kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly value the advice letters from students and have deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations for self-inspection, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the exam will be more in line with reality, thus allowing "excellent students" and "poor students" to get what they deserve.
Can I get delivery instead if you can't change my store location?
Do I need to give any more money then?
The colleague's order has been sent out.
I can't pull it off.
Is the GPS working?
Mrs. Kim's Bridal Photography (Nanjie Store) has no branches yet.
Before taking the photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time properly, and the consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
We chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I ever put on makeup formally, wow~ I can't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
We were shooting exteriors at Jiangwan City and luckily the weather was good that day so we didn't feel too cold. The makeup artist was paying attention to our clothes and headgear from time to time and would immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, we were hesitant to let the guests delete too many photos because we had seen many cases online, but when we were selecting photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, we just chose the 24 photos from the package, not adding any (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and there were two that I didn't like, so they immediately helped me to fix them again.
I pulled out my sister's old photos and compared them to ours and I'm really satisfied with ours. It's simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady to take wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim expresses her gratitude to you all and wishes you all happiness, good luck and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeit paper stock, birth certificates have not been able to be issued to newborns, with a cumulative total of 3,200 people affected so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerem Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will be issued with the anti-counterfeit paper when it arrives next week.
He explained at the press conference in response to a report by a web media that there had been a paper printing issue for Sabah newspaper for a period of 10 months.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah newspaper was different from other regions, so it was not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kairu Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, estimated to be delivered to the applicant in two working days (December 20).
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting since 7 o'clock or later
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.

The achievements have been made under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and achieved through the concerted efforts of the whole Party and all the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control at port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up "buffer zones" - Xinhua News
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic at port cities, requiring people who have recently left port cities on the mainland (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to port cities on the mainland must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
Furthermore, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The responsible person from the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
Implementing differentiated management policies in different regions, changing from one line of defense against the spread of the epidemic to two lines of defense, and moving the control point forward, compressing the risk of epidemic spread, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent days, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in all links, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency handling of the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job of prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the potential risks of basic living materials supply and prices, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water and air ports are open, cities (districts, states, leagues) and directly-administered cities where they are located, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by provinces (autonomous regions, directly-administered cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Xinhua News Uncovers the Truth of US Military's 20-Year Bloodthirsty Slaughter Through YouTube Videos
Video source: YouTube
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
This film tells the story of the US launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war. For 20 years, they have been fighting fiercely, killing indiscriminately, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abusing drone strikes on civilian targets such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and forming killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
Each act of inhumanity stirs up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" has become "more terrorizing than terrorized".
War has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article which explains why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, even though canning is a deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. Here is the article which may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many infant formula factories and interacted with many infant formula production lines.
Actually, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a can is two years or longer?
Why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged?
Actually, many consumers, or moms, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat with this mentality and then say that the taste or flavor of the packaged product is different!
Now I will explain to everyone why the hearing aid is expensive, where is the value?
Why is there such a big difference in price when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in their list prices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote listening packaging rather than bag packaging.
Where does all the money for the millions or even billions of advertising fees that companies spend each year come from?
As you can imagine.
As society develops, the costs of market promotion, such as shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product gifts, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, especially earphones, and their prices are also increasing, which is actually due to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary, and collaborate with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, taking a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per person.
Chinese relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods, in fact, this kind of practice is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that, under the premise of having a can at home, people should buy bagged milk powder and put it into the can, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder without any effect on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food was late and cold, dry and hard, completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the stuff he sent from #PRS_ORG# must be cold by now.

Don't Scare People at the Starting Line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of success-related books.
Many of the successful books of today preach the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
These books all have one thing in common - either go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
This "best principle", which everyone would recognize as "absolutely right", but 99% of people would be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make a firm resolution, start over, and make a 180 degree turn" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you must change" in the ear of someone who is conservative and resists change.
Most people are timid in the face of the word "transformation", reluctant to take action and make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow On" cross-talk perfectly expresses this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way to get more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
At the end of the day, anything is better than nothing if you do something.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it is now possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence comes a greater chance of success.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner of success for all, but in reality it only motivates a few; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resource Reserve Increases by 71,000 Tons This Year - Xinhua News
According to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year to 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, also known as "Khuangyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting, the degradation of the naked carp breeding water environment, etc., the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the 2004 Chinese Species Red List.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage".
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
This year, in order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to order food over $180.
But the order was not deducted $20.

The restaurant only gave me one bag to put it in, it's cold outside.
Is the takeout packed in one bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if something was missed or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about maternity leave and it was too long.
Educating Men Who Don't Know
Most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Under the premise of good health, it will come regularly once a month.
It's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can suddenly come earlier by several days.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; the pain of menstruation can change over time, and just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
Uncontrollable menstrual bleeding for several days, 24 hours a day, with only sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from staining clothes and furniture.
Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the menstrual cycle can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but it is not effective if taken after the pain has started.
Diarrhea is common before menstruation due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release.
If you are around your period, if you suddenly have stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
Change the sanitary pad every five to six hours, or at most eight hours.
Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation and ovulation can make one more irritable and emotionally unstable due to the hormonal changes in the body, making it a bit of a bummer and a hindrance to oneself.
Official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrium thickening) every month to prepare for guests, but if no guests come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding for a few days 24 hours a month, and abdominal and back pain, who would want it?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things for women were suppressed before, society brainwashed women that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a female body for bearing life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well, don't be so ungrateful and rude. How can they face their own mother with this attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they're really useful.
It's disappointing to make mistakes on Winter Solstice today.
Order extra food for the children.
Hope the store will check the products even in the midst of busyness.
Is the foot bath tub sparking because of an electrical leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect. Today, Gome's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a variety of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice.
From the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the pen and it lit up. To his surprise, he found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath tubs in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it is suitable for, and what materials are safe to use.
Generally speaking, there is no electrical problem with foot baths, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity separation, no safety hazards.
You can also take a random electric pen test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline View - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily reported on December 10th (Full media reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photography Li Jian) that this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum for "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
Tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen, and the main tea producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and red tea is gaining strength.
Provincial tea experts said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is rising steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xihua celebrated the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
The new red tea adds a touch of red, infusing the connotation of tea culture, popular and hot in trading, and the tea industry in Hunan welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, as there was no place to park below, so he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The one above is called the Way, and the one below is called the instrument" in the "Xici Zhuan" of the Book of Changes, translated by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) from the word "metaphysic".
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns represent only concepts.
Metaphysical Naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
The theoretical basis for this is that all phenomena can be explained by naturalistic concepts, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.

Descriptive Ethics (collecting information about how people live, making generalizations from observed patterns) Applied Ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to practical situations, including bioethics and political ethics) and Normative Ethics (studying what kind of moral behavior people should adhere to).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theory, but from the investigation of actual moral agents' real choices and observed decisions, all the moral factors that lead to these choices, and the ethics held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic Ethical Thought, Represented by Such People as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical Thought of Religious Reform, Represented by Calvin.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our loved one, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted to this day.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the deceased have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
Your kind deed helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult moments.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to our hard-pressed group, the Tiananmen Mothers, as this humanitarian relief effort should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Student Societies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
The All-China Democracy Foundation of Minnesota and the American Council of Learned Societies are two parallel organizations engaged in humanitarian relief, with project implementers often crossing over.

Aid money often fails to reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor and Elderly Special Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by donations from campuses and society in 1989, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June 4th.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation was for the consideration of the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the affected people to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if needed.
We express our gratitude and respect to those brave comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Thank you for choosing our product. Please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully before using our chip.
Please check if the goods are complete after unpacking.
If there is any missing, please contact customer service in time.
The microfluidic chip lid is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a syringe pump to directly inject into the chip, otherwise leakage may occur.
All standard base microfluidic chips are tested with pure water at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure before shipment.
The chips with glass substrates are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) inlet pressure before delivery. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using chips with glass substrates, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution during use and do not exceed this range, otherwise leakage may occur.
Under the condition of using pure water for injection pump, we suggest that the flow rate of aqueous phase should be set below 150ul/min and the flow rate of oil phase should be set below 50ul/min for a general-base microfluidic chip.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual sample liquid and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.
Please clean the internal channels promptly after the general chip experiment is completed, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
No exchange or refund if the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation.
If you need microfluidic chips with higher pressure or flow rate tolerance, please contact customer service for customization.

Photo Effect: Took two sets of clothes, overall not bad, like this set of pictures~
Service Details: Because I was feeling a bit uncomfortable due to pregnancy during makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and they kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package Price: 1000 Yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally I said that rejecting ancient style is not suitable for ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep going. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Perfection in reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography and post-production.
The makeup artist is very delicate, and can match a suitable makeup for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also top-brand.
Teacher Liang doesn't need to be said, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, with two little cats playing together.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We have poor facial expression management, feeling that this is also the case for most people, and photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-rounded team.
We and the people around us all praised it in unison.
I recommended my best friend and she was equally delighted after seeing the photos.
I hope such studios won't be buried, more people can discover them and shoot with their own style, instead of being all the same.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful to meet you.
Sweet and caring assistant, lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice, a wonderful shooting, an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting is much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much. 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Little Universe. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to know you all. I hope I can come back to Qinhuangdao to play next time.
How do I pay?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
If you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is certainly an important thing.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the faculty strength is not strong enough, then this training institution will not have much meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Before making a choice, it is best to inquire about the training institution, and even better to inquire about the students from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you didn't give any introduction about your own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with one's own situation.
Such as profession, age, language to learn, even in which city, these will all be related to the field you are studying or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one is expensive to learn, two takes a lot of time, basically need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
If it were me, self-learning would be very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet for free, or you can also go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay for some learning costs and time, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not have to be too hard, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Nowadays, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of things.
These are my thoughts, as I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction, if you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I'd be there by 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.

But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persist and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
Start the day with the morning, all the good things start from the morning. I hope you start the new day with joy, luck, health and all the best. Have a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something we had; when we grew up, happiness was something we strived for; when we matured, we realized that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding it was happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live life brightly until old age!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them head on, the problems will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi Jointly Hold the First Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) that the first Contemporary Art Biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on the 11th at Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition works, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly sought after. Some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain Series" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Barry Baker, Chief Executive Officer of the Deriyyeh Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this biennial will establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain insight into the vibrant cultural and creative communities of Saudi Arabia and strengthen the interaction between them.
Fei Yu said: "The biennial's goal is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe shovel.
The restaurant told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones.
Want to ask for clarification of the reason.
Bones can be, order the restaurant to package and deliver separately.
The system is not very convenient, so we have to use another one.
I'm at the #ADDRESS# branch in Meixinli.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua News
In order to continuously help the impoverished population with employment and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare posts in rural areas to promote rural revitalization and help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way. (Lin Bifeng, Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12)
The relevant responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor forces, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
The new regulations clearly stipulate that the establishment of posts should be based on the principles of "post setting according to demand, personnel setting according to post, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one post per person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It is required that the relevant departments regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.

Hello

Although the right-wingers have had their moments of success in history, they have not lasted long. They are short-lived because they shine brightly when given a bit of sunshine and sweat when given a sip of water; they can reach the horizon of Longxi when they are successful, but they will be attached to the hair when they are hit.
But to be fair, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his words and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think counter-revolution is necessary, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourthly, in order to change or improve China, we must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists, in fact, are a group of abandoned people of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party is willing to listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I have seen some friends arguing with anti-revolutionaries while getting angry, which I think is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the rebels and the left-wingers admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you five mao, and the leftists call you right dog, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they pursue them but become obsessed.
As the ideal fades further away, even the young dragon slayer may become a wicked dragon.
I feel that generally speaking, it refers to constraint and freedom. China's historical and cultural innate genes lead to the overall tendency of China being left-leaning.
Right-wingers domestically emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers focus on strengthening regulation, fairness, and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is leaning left, which is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
Nothing more to say, Flower Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains globally.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected many industries around the world, such as car companies suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are affected.
In order to gain "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, either hosting the "Chip Summit" or inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance and subsidizing US domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old American technology giant Intel invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip outsourcing business.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter".
This is certain because Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Morris Chang was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory. Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said that Intel's investment in building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the wafer field because he still remembered the grudges between TSMC and Intel from more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, dominating the world's peak position and the world's semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured and tested by one factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of strain on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to bear the huge costs of setting up production lines.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to specialize and cooperate in the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, he could set up a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has targeted its main business to the single process of wafer fabrication, providing only outsourced services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time of its founding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was a small fry compared to Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
Unexpectedly, the giants that looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic that Intel entered the semiconductor foundry business.
Now TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stay put.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Wait no more.

Let's take a look at some "Weird Hot Searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
The public opinion of "Dragon Raising its Head on the Second Day of February", "Kellogg's Price Increase", and "Hualala Incident" spread rapidly, forming a peak, then gradually decreased (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump appearing again.
They look identical to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China has previously displayed.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event to present a "solitary peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff" shape.
"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating up to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water soldiers receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which control decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination.
Propaganda is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Everyone leaves a trace behind when they pass by, let's dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries first discovered cases of Omikron strain infection - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12th - According to reports from Xinhua's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the novel coronavirus strain of the Omicron Rho virus on the 10th.
According to Health Minister Kailash Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the virus on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
Cyprus Health Ministry announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. As they all have mild symptoms, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
The government is continuously increasing its efforts to prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country had identified its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found these 3 infection cases.

I was introduced by a friend and chose to come and take a look because of trust. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began when they arrived at the store.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan, but they didn't even measure the house. They were able to give me a quote that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you get to the store, they will pressure you into paying a deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience to fight them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
They charge more for their services than other companies do.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything first.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, biting the customer is their problem and they are not at all to blame.
They shift the blame around, there are a lot of details, I don't want to talk about them all, it's all tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend's house they renovated was also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees afterwards.
They are the same scammers who used to be the head of decoration, now they changed to something else, pretending to be great, but it seems like they have closed down again.
So don't choose such a shady decoration company.
In the future, when choosing, everyone should Baidu and check these consultations, because decoration is not a small amount of money.
Please log in or register to ask a question to the merchant.

Starry Appointment | Gemini Meteor Shower to Reach Peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency reported from Tianjin on December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
The Gemini Meteor Shower photographed by Beijing Astronomy Enthusiasts on December 13th, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini Meteor Shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Director and Astronomy Popularization Expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like the New Year's movie, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady rate of flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Geminid meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the "Lyrid meteor shower" of Gemini left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted a bit.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar, it is November 11th, and the moon phase is a full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the later part of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe more meteors as much as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view towards the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until after the moon sets, and observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there is no need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to capture the beautiful 'meteor shower' shots, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter release cables are also essential, considering stability and sustainability.
Peng reminded to build.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD television, and the difference in market positioning between laser television and LCD television mainly includes the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, the sales of laser TVs in 2020 will increase by more than 140%, continuing its high-speed growth.
The excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection is mainly responsible for the good results in the large-screen market.
Imaging based on the principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, compared to the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Chinese Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute's Sacy Laboratory and Beijing Union Medical College Eye Hospital experts, through a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population, obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
With the increasing emphasis on vision health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above 10,000 yuan, and the prices are gradually rising with the upgrade of size and light source.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with small space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less equipment wear, the life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Don't talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the curtain, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block out some ambient light, a microstructured FEP screen is used, which is expensive; the price of an 80-inch one is basically enough to get a 65-inch LCD.
I also hate it when projector manufacturers use "eye-friendly" diffusion as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. LCD TVs are also "directly" diffused. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
And if the projection screen isn't diffuse, it won't look like anything at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high gain screens was overlooked, and it was really uncomfortable when a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from a certain angle.

After I added her on WeChat to make an appointment, the lady sent me a list of available times, and she replied to my messages quickly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the salesperson and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling~ The photographer will arrange some props and guide the action before taking the photos, and he is also very meticulous about the details.
However, since we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted wasn't achieved, but it should still look nice 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select the photos, communicate the post-production style, and feel very attentive.
The repaired piece will take about half a month, waiting for the effect~
I won the photography category of the Bawang Meal Activity ~ most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
She chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Selected Quality Store Reply
Let's go back to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
I filled out my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then I chose the clothes, including wedding dresses. They were very patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After I chose the clothes, they did my makeup for a long time and the service attitude was good. They taught me how to pose for the photos afterwards. The only downside was that the photos made my face look bigger. They said it would take half a month to do the retouching, but I received the photos in three or four days and it didn't seem much different from the original.
The overall environment is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup locations, and inside is a photography studio.
Very friendly and attentive service.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also take you seriously and teach you poses.
If dissatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to suggest a reshoot.
The experience was a bit too much, as the original double eyelids were made into triple eyelids.
I feel a bit awkward not having eyebrows for daily life since I got them shaved off.
The photos were delivered in ten days, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
After trying two styles and not being sure which one to choose, I ended up selecting the black dress. The salesperson said this style was more of a classic, vintage Audrey Hepburn look.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After doing my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for editing. The guy said he would finish the photos within 15 minutes and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation, is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
To become an insurance broker company, three key criteria must be met according to the Insurance Brokerage Supervision Regulations (Revised in 2015): shareholders, no major violations in the past three years, and a minimum registered capital of RMB 50 million, which must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In summary, these three requirements are quite stringent. To be a legitimate insurance broker, the company must have the strength, be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and have shareholders with good conduct. As an insurance broker, Small Umbrella Insurance, the policyholder does not need to question whether it is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
It's not bad on this point, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It is worth considering.
From the perspective of professionalism of the insurance agent: this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or qualified, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being denied a claim.
I used to do insurance telemarketing for Tencent Weibao (an internet insurance brokerage platform, similar to Little Rain Umbrella), and I was very responsible in informing people.
The insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but the people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is Need to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years, they don't know what they bought.
Insurer pays 6 million for a 1-dollar policy (the world is upside down).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - a free coverage of 60,000 for critical illness, which is short-term. If there is no other commercial insurance and a critical illness occurs, 60,000 won't be enough to solve the problem and life will start to become bare.
The state is also cracking down on the mis-selling of internet insurance.
So, in summary, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster should consider carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody, and let customers be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although there is no "ceremony" for internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telephone sales" assembly line, but such insurance purchases can also have a fatal problem, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Shouldn't we carefully consider the "intermediary" we choose when we purchase insurance, which is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, and make sure that it is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us even many years later?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door to deliver the goods.
The rider just left the package at the door and then left.
Wrong delivery
Your rider has picked up my takeout at #NUMBER# but is still telling me it's waiting.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
Do you want any other takeout after I finish buying?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene issues.

Redeem the discount code and you're good to go.
No problem, remember no need to arrange for reshipment, I have already bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have opposed any form of slander and insult from the past to the present, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we put aside political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Ever since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, posting sarcastic posts, and trying to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
Not only did you continue to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but you also continued to talk about me in an obscure and humiliating way on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed, etc. I...just let it go.
Later I received messages from multiple friends about a photo of you and sexually harassing comments uploaded to your Facebook account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news of reporting the police was uploaded, you became even more arrogant instead of calming down.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say you are just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your plan or continue to make all the offensive comments.
That's right, I can't and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, and my looks and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
My friend asked me, "How are you doing?"
I said yes, but you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Those without even basic decency would be the only ones to choose to harm any woman in this way, whether in the workplace, in society, in politics, or in business.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of people.
I have cut some comments for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you with the posts you have made yourself.
I can only say you are a civilized enemy.
A hearty laugh

On December 11, Xinhua News Agency reported from Wuhan (reporter Wang Xian) that the Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.

Two water-based green comprehensive service areas have been built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Integrating life services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, the "one-time mooring and multiple services" of ships in the port will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Latest satellite images show three US aircraft carriers gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, rarely seen visiting Guam, is sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of the Chinese think tank, a satellite detected the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait on January 9th.
The Strait of Malacca, connecting the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy is currently cruising in the Pacific with the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The USS Abraham Lincoln was the first to carry an F-35C squadron, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.

According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend, reported on January 17th by (Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception).
The USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Analysis suggests that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region as three US aircraft carriers gather around China and make a rare visit to Guam.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea Islands in recent years.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
The United States Navy stated in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the United States' capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Thunder" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secret mission of ballistic missile submarines, known as the "Boomers", makes them the "most important survivable leg of the nuclear triad", which also includes land-based launch silos for ballistic missiles, and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
What is the reason behind Mark Zuckerberg's response that Facebook is facing "unprecedented competition" after the 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value when talking to friends recently?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue primarily coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, whatever the functional positioning is, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Furthermore, Meta is the largest "Advertising Alliance", many Apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustments to its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, prompting users clearly whether to allow an App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction would be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is commonly known that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies doing business in the sea.
Meta has about a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents in Mainland China.
The Chinese company wants to expand its overseas market, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, so most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China Region is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only look at current income, but more importantly, at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The realization of the metaverse should be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of $100-200 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis, and compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, there is no good safety net.
Although his several social apps now have a high daily active user count and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of a grand universe is unattainable in the short term and therefore very risky for Facebook, which is why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new avenues. However, I think his choice of avenues was wrong and it was a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
