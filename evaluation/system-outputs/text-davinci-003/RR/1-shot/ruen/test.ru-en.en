From my perspective, the literature program was formed by Balzac-age women based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very Balzacian ladies.
Psychology and the suffering of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroines is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, that's very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
Prestige Micro Pack Model: Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - by a natural latex plate.
The 1000-spring block per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Breathable materials should be highlighted among the model's merits.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally well-ventilated, just like coconut coir.
This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty is 5 years, but the mattress has a longer lifespan.
The protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover supplied with the product.
Get an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress – it is recommended to support optimal spine alignment while sleeping.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrei, it has been clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not be working in a team line.
The computer teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught that, the school kids are playing Windows games.
No support whatsoever.
I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the door, and cutlets are still frying on the stove, mother is bustling around mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
Then mop the floor and clean the house.
You shop for groceries a week before the holiday, cook for two days, and clean up the day after.
And the guests?
They are doing well, and they must bring a cake too.
Ever since then, I haven't liked holidays or guests.
I set the table with the bare minimum even for my family.
I cook them delicious treats and bake just for fun.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccination is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
Ulrich Weigel, the head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required by summer at the latest, fall at the latest," says the expert.
Wiegandt also hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be administered "in combination with a flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with the Omega strain is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the preliminary research results conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25-fold".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging for faster vaccination rates in the country.
For example, Bernhard Zalzberger, the chair of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, as Zalzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omikron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib 54 Silent 54mm 8.5g Lure
Bet-A-Vib series - a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) stands out from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with bottom fishing in mind, not just casting and retrieving.
These baits have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogs, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top plate made of strong and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when wired vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter bait" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is the simplest, such as a monotonous up-and-down motion of the rod with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
Additionally, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for sea bass and large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the end point of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To accommodate her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive catfish that does not even react to live bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib shows distance and accuracy.
This lure is easy to use and not finicky, and it works well with both monofilament and braided lines of larger diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or roach, besides a steady retrieve, sometimes a "bouncing" along the bottom is effective.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch to a double hook which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, as a result, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

It has been reported that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries in Libya.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
On Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri declared this.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt), - Anadolu agency reports.
Haled al-Mishri also stated that Russian mercenaries are attempting to seize the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency report.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy assets.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to exploit mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to media reports, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in either the military or the corporate registry, and its fighters are not listed in the formal personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We recall that the EU ambassadors of 27 countries previously approved sanctions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto serves as a second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures predominate.
Examples of successes - "Protected and restored peace in Syria", "Resolution on the Nord Stream-2", "Frightened the whole world with sharp weapons", "We took back Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are mentioned in the research of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have become digital only.
The Government of Dubai announced a complete rejection of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
Today marks the start of a new era of digitalisation for all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, all internal and external document circulation in Dubai government entities will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The new initiative touched all sectors without exception: healthcare, utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
Over this period, authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary value.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
That's already ridiculous, asking about birth dates and how old the child is, and also about the class and group in kindergarten.
I can't believe such shenanigans happen.
If they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including family.

These people knew for sure that someone was home...
Turkey's car production and exports have dropped below the 2020 level.
Turkish car production and exports sharply declined in November due to the devaluation of the lira.
According to Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association, the industry's figures for the 11-month period were worse than last year's results.
According to the association, in November Turkey released 115 thousand cars from factories, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75,900 vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
If the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11th month of 2021 was 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which depreciated by 29% against the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 MSB entities have been granted a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on providing benefits for small and medium businesses, according to the correspondent of Kazinform news agency.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in order to fulfill the instructions of the Head of State from April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses" on April 9, 2021, Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the deferral of loan payments provided for banks and microfinance organizations included deferral of payments on loans issued to MSB subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was between 30 and 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's statement may have indicated an alternative payment deferral period.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and demand work, notice of overdue debt repayment, and collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, 603 loan borrowers-SMEs submitted applications for payment deferral to second-tier banks, of which 553 SMEs received deferral for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
A. Smailov concluded that 131 applications for deferment were submitted to the MFO, of which 95 subjects were granted deferment for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily transmit the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" coronavirus strain could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "coronavirus" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Without an immunity response, he became very fast.
It seems that he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe than he should have, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is often the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s just shrug it off.
Sergei Puryasev concluded that the immune response of the young man was completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he was shooting like a gun at sparrows.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope lies with the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication - this is fever, weakness, and malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
By the end of the year, Russia may begin vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Pavel Volchkov, head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and a virologist, noted that this category of people is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, like kindergarteners, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I fondly reminisced...
Teach-In.
In the distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was complete without the melodies of this group.
At home, gathering with friends, they would dance to their music.
Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19.
The authors of the study examined the adipose tissue remaining from bariatric operations and found that the fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied fat tissue from patients who died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is likely capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Semen Goloshekin, a candidate of biological sciences, named the causes of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin noted that most often, neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Negative habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep deprivation, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the decline of mental health.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
It is being discussed that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining an adequate level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic involvement to prevent the onset of disease.
Previously a professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics at the Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov.

Egypt returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the chief inspector of the Department of Repatriated Antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, reported this on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV.
Since 2011, Egypt has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
"This year alone, 5300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector reported that upon return, cultural artifacts will be restored and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held an auction where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This has caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the form of the sun god Amun, has been held in a private collection and not put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively working towards repatriating illegally exported antiquities from the country in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
Crimean Tatars are not taken into account - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, banks can review information on corporate devices issued to their employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or clients.
The Bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have shifted to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse is not officially commenting on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, is a loner but well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Sniegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
The main success was that on the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern-day Sergei Alexandrovich poet has been honored with such an honor, he is the first!
Furthermore, it promised very good money - the contract stipulated a salary of 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Maxim Gorky married Sofia Tolstoy, the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Kata and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly dark, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Over the empty and deserted field
Like a grove in September
Alcohol is brain-numbing.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very bad, had obviously weakened, and was clearly ill.
Increasingly frequent outbursts and nervous breakdowns.
And the cause is likely not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergey Aleksandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
In 1923, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, Esenin was recuperating in the clinic of Professor Petrus Gannushkin near Paris (he would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
There is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this soil, and arrests by the police scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrifying romance with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of summer 1923, Esenin stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev, for a short time.
Amazingly, despite his relatively good income, Esenin never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg, instead renting apartments, staying in hotels, or staying with friends.
Starcev Remembers
He would only come to stay the night, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the landing...
As he fell, he scratched his face and whimpered.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, spraying the sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (there was Prohibition in the States at the time, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I'm almost done and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
I drank because sadness gnawed at me.

His son is almost 16 now and he no longer has any desire to experiment.
All his energy is directed towards choosing what he will earn a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband was before we got married, who had occasional run-ins with the law.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely".

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the European Union.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons".
Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Pawel Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement by the Deputy Foreign Minister was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonksy, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new paths".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many points of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that have previously imposed sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Seńka's Hat": When a Velvet Jacket Makes a Man a Laughing Stock
Velvet blazers were the dominant fashion at 2021 social events.
Daniel Craig was probably the first to announce his new fashion statement.
At the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die" in September, he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, which was not in line with the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was adopted by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to analysts from the service, reported by Gazeta.Ru, their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet blazers with lining and fitted silhouette, main colors - dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models ranges from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
This season, almost all luxury brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent - have velvet blazers in their collections.
The most sought-after model is the Gucci, which was worn by brand ambassador Jared Leto at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
By choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Through a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is created with a textured outer surface and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not the model or cut, but appropriateness.
Velvet requires evening light, so such a tuxedo is ideal if you are attending a party or a formal event, explains Vakhoshkin. It is also suitable for cases where the invitation specifies a dress code of "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to consider when choosing a velvet blazer is the status of its buyer.
According to the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel", a man in a velvet jacket should first of all have a proper advanced entourage with enough money. People who usually wear velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with equally dressy items such as classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, and cufflinks.
Too simple and mundane things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from those who organize this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If a lower-ranking employee's goal is to advance higher up in a complex corporate hierarchy or to earn financial bonuses, then it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Ambiguous feelings from the voice.

It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.

The immunologist stated that revaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination within four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccine six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Previously, this timeline was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure within five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - within four," said the expert, calling for parallel to the vaccination campaign, to take care of revaccination.
Krechkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two doses and a booster, or they have been vaccinated and then got sick, or they have been sick and then vaccinated, then they have a 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have a lot of neutralizing antibodies," the expert clarified.
The G7 warned Russia of "significant consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The G7 countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" to Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's escalating military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers then called on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments to transparency in military activities," as President Biden discussed during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
We also affirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine, - the foreign ministers of the G7 declare.
The use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation for our collective and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier today, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron-strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than other forms of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omikron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
Scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The researchers concluded that the omikron-strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position on firearms, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
On Sunday, Ukraine's Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government had explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbas, despite the "Russian occupation" of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to be a "technical partner" of Ukraine, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.

We should add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, in which Vettel beat Hamilton by 2,256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is now provisional pending the consideration of Mercedes' protests.

Revealed methods of recovering stolen money from online stores.
There are several ways to get your money back if it is stolen through online stores and to avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when making purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement with the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Additionally, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores will refund the customer themselves if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19th, Member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online scammers.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Belarus border, judicial independence in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the Ukraine border, and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be calling on Schulz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravcsek, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disputes.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland for establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on any public commitments to stop the "Nord Stream 2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional staffer in the United States reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.

Sergei Tokarev, Chief Epidemiologist of the Urals Federal District, Scientific Director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants randomly and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and beginning to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And upon physical examination before vaccination, doctors observe bruising.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
An incident occurred at the large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that faithful Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He donated the church find and, according to him, didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the discovery is related to the theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
A reward of twenty-five thousand dollars was offered for information on the criminals.
Justin Cole could not claim the amount as the reward had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in a donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive twenty thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.

A new human case of avian influenza has been recorded in China.
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been reported in China.
Radio station RTHK reported this, citing a notification from Hong Kong health authorities, according to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the Huai'an District in the southern province of Guangdong has been infected with the virus after keeping poultry at home.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The first human infection of the H5N6 strain of virus was recorded in May 2014 in Sichuan Province in southwest China.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entry into the country.
Brazil has been mandated to require a COVID-19 passport from those entering its territory, a decision made by Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the exemption list are those who have arrived from countries where no vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barrozo noted.
Previously, the authorities in Brazil required unvaccinated tourists infected with coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
Comprehensive COVID-19 Protection Plan Revealed
Anatoly Altstein, a virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and a distinguished scientist of Russia, revealed the full protection scheme from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved through the injection and intranasal vaccination.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
After vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) formed.
"If you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor said.
Sergei Tokarev, Chief Epidemiologist of the UrFO and Doctor of Medical Sciences, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using intranasal vaccination in combination with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that case the organism's protection should presumably become maximal.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the same picture seen in other countries where the latest wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I used to talk to my old dog like this - if you're willing to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But the sparrow was trained and generally smart.
I chose my society and went home.
A video method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not just pulled out of thin air, believe me.
I held back many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand were running away (in Pomsk), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 Thousand" chose a master, not a dog running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe.
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
From February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's policies on healthcare, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs that read "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
A Covid-19 certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues in the autonomous community.
The authorities of several regions of the country have adopted a decision to introduce sanitary passports in response to the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
The group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement personnel used water cannons.
There is no consensus on this issue even in Wikipedia according to Nikolai S.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

The World Health Organization has already detected the coronavirus in over sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already warning that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The World Health Organization reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, by December 9th, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite it only becoming actively spread since the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, preliminarily, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omikron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of those infected in the UK alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people in the Kingdom currently suffering from the coronavirus, and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omikron" strain, and at the peak hospitals will be taking more than 2,000 people a day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is further complicated by recent studies showing that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than against other strains.
It is unknown how the Russian satellite "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.

The Curious Rabbit is right, communicating online is quite different, it's easy and relaxed, but when meeting in person there's nothing to say.
To actually see the person in person, maybe it wasn't what you expected, it didn't click - hence the attitude.

Our St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina Street still supports communication to this day.
We may not be the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe it was because there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we seem to be attending funerals more and more often.
Lara, cast off!
Human infants, especially of the male sex, are strong, active, energetic, fretful, pushing, fighting, and scuffling, just like their little "brethren" in the living world!

Starting from the morning of December 12th, coronavirus vaccinations are being administered in schools across Israel.

In 2021, worldwide user spending in apps increased by 25%, while downloads increased by 8%.
Video streaming services became the most popular in the world.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most time on YouTube.
App downloads and user spending in them showed a significant growth from January to November 2021.
Downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly, user spending in apps grew by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to physical' slow down the growth of app economy? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India is the leader in app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
Behind them are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
The video editor CapCut was the most downloaded app in 2021.
Following it are two Indian apps: the video service MX TakaTak and the online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 downloads.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, among users the most popular are VPN services (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are in the top 10).
"Users spent the most in apps for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report noted.
YouTube leads here, with video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma also in the top 5 for user spending.
The top five monthly active users are Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in downloads for the year.

People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be considered one of the main takeaways.
"The industries that helped people stay connected virtually and personally have seen the most success," commented Lexi Sidow, head of marketing research at App Annie, on the report's results.
Mobile gaming revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. Casual and hyper-casual games, with minimal or no story and video presentation, were the leaders in downloads.
The top 3 most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
Previously, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Analysts from the company have identified the following trends for next year: an increase in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, an increase in popularity among Generation Z of financial apps such as the investor app Robinhood, and further growth in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director, Zurab Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of extortion.
"Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious perpetrator can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Alexander Vetkol, the lead systems engineer at Varonis, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-enabled technologies.
David, I'll add.

Five Actions to Help Avoid Diabetes
Blood sugar level issues are one of the most common in the world.
However, some don't give it much importance, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes mellitus can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Eating too much sugar can raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only improper nutrition but also habits can affect the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova discussed the "weekend migrane" among hard workers.
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of worsening health after workdays is often "weekend fatigue", said Zukhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, and head of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workers who suffer from this the most often experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to a change in conditions.
On weekends our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep too long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "A small breakdown starts due to lack of coffee."
Due to overuse and lack of water - hardship and fragmentation.
Late risers play an additional role.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jetlag will occur.
Jet lag
To determine which factor plays the most decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have declared the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, raising doubts about the vaccine's ability to protect against infection - the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
The experts clarified that the drug could save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the new variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index - may be listed under an unfamiliar word in the product's composition.
On the label, there may be several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
The most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other hidden sugars may include dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, hot dogs, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar may vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has stated that gas imports are becoming less important for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
He said that Germany plans to be a climate-neutral country by 2045, completely phasing out the use of gas, oil, and coal.
"So in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Previously, German Foreign Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline continues.
According to the minister, it was stated in the framework of the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline does not currently "comply with the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers breached the Twitter account of the Indian Prime Minister.
Hackers breached the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
The Modo office asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister stated that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12th, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's residents voted against independence in the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
France-Presse agency commented on these interim results, saying "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence called on voters to abstain from voting.
They initiated the referendum, but opposed its December 12th date, arguing that the new COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago was preventing a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
Separatists have declared that they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
On Sunday, December 12th, it was reported that French President Emmanuel Macron is set to speak on the results of the referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major topic of discussion in the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have expressed support for the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
In May 2018, Emmanuel Macron declared on his part that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed "strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be the choice of France".

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
A new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will start producing ANKA type Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, this was reported by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," according to Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it in all characteristics.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant by the end of next year, Areshtovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
Turkey's government has been developing an unmanned aerial vehicle in collaboration with several private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General Staff had previously classified the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the joint forces' military operations in Donbas.
On December 6th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29th, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a training, testing, and maintenance center for Turkish Bayraktar UAVs in Kiev Oblast.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions took refuge on the roof of a container.
The animals could not move away from it due to the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that a lion escaped from its owner in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and was roaming the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal returned home voluntarily and no people were harmed.
Experts warned of a cancer risk due to Vitamin B9.
Studies have shown that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folate, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a folate deficiency are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Bet Kitchin of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, a dietitian, advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking Vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to be sure to monitor dosage, and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is found in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die by April due to the new coronavirus strain.
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people in England may die in the next five months due to the spread of the mutant strain of coronavirus if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, the country will record no fewer than 25,000 deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the illness, the hospital will be receiving more than 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Serious measures may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
The UK's Health Security Agency has informed that if the rate of spread of the Omikron strain remains at its current level, there will be around 1 million cases of infection in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omikron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently in the UK, there have been 1898 cases of infection with the OMICRON-strain of coronavirus, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the British Department of Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, indicated that in reality this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.

Global demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter.
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking world records despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the global ship registry was 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change through reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money for a floating fortress costing 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this much excitement in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Before, all these people would go to the office and meet with business partners in person, but now the absolute majority of them work remotely and negotiations are held via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the wealthy and call it decadent.
Wealthy people, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, luxuries such as space travel, yacht life, or private jet flights cause resentment in society, as the elite do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the keel over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine for exploring the depths of the sea.
Superyachts have become commonplace with helicopter pads, outdoor cinemas, and on some, like boxer Floyd Mayweather's, even a fighting ring. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gases emitted, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance when considering that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two thirds of the mission's budget went towards his 162.5 meter yacht, the Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from others when, like Australia's wealthiest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines across the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at a two-year-old child's level.
All dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't realize how intelligent four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence has developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, understand nothing of politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not yet enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labrador Retrievers.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and have the same learning capacity as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade negotiations between the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to resume talks in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate, you'll just send the offeror away.
"Trade is on the horizon for Ukraine," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov said that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"They prepare secretly, quickly, and move to offensive actions instead of waiting for the grouping to be discovered and counter-forces to be deployed," he noted.
China is promoting the development of the railway transportation industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Expo held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted by the company's representative, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies to ensure increased reliability and operational performance of rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd., destined for export to Europe.
These trains will travel at a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the railway lines of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), said that the Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness.
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaojiang.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, China has created a leading system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaosan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Semen Goloshekin, a candidate of biological sciences, listed the early signs of dementia in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as difficulty with concentration, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about hearing loss being both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golsheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, medical professionals do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of dementia will be helped by studying foreign languages and active communication.
The World Health Organization also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking," said Golosheikin.
The UK-based dementia research charity has previously stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness, specialists have called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical consortium created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The specialist said that the stable problems are those related to mobility, coordination, and variability of character, noting that this is not within the normative framework and that the former president needs to be sent to a special rehabilitation now.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-neurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to boycott the receipt of medical assistance after personnel from the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
Approximately 3,000 people participated in the action in the Catalan capital.
COVID-passports are now mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues in Barcelona.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR-code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass event venues, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a vaccination certificate or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be applied for train and plane travel.

Steep Ascent: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million people to winter sports, which will help to raise the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward and remote provinces.
The Taivu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation experience at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizer Advisor, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70 years old, lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chuni, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
Cafeterias serving national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach world-class standards.
More than 5 billion people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In recognition of International Universal Health Coverage Day on December 12th, the WHO and WBG have released two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has caused disruptions in health care services and has put an excessive strain on health care systems.
For the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB have highlighted that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty and more than four billion people had virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister Disconnected from "Summit for Democracy" Broadcast at White House Request
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" panel discussion was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the Summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters Agency citing sources claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked on it as "free" in green, and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked as "closed" in red.
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources noted that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, chief editor of "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

On Saturday, December 11th, the Blue Origin company's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board completed a suborbital flight.
The journey, broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes before the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the rocket carrier was conducted from a spaceport in the vicinity of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The spacecraft rose to a height of just over 100 km, and the space tourists experienced weightlessness.
The rocket booster itself landed safely on the launch pad.
On July 20th, Blue Origin successfully conducted the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers onboard.

Don't lump them all together - there are bad people out there, you may have specific grievances against them...
But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on?
Write that they are "scoundrels, who have not returned the money".
It's none of your business how many and when they have children, until they hang them around your neck.
Since it is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's only in education like this...
Elected parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding existing ones.

They have no laws written for them.
What if Dad does implement his own method of upbringing and education?
It's a terrible example and a very bad example for others.

China is strengthening COVID-19 prevention and control in cities where land border crossings are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day that the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
It is also noted that cities hosting land border crossing points and meeting certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that a long path of engagement had led to sad conclusions, and the issues between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but as far as any prospect of improving relations is concerned, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long journey we have taken with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a range of issues.
The Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cyber security, there has been no progress.
Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that its signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of administering a nasal COVID vaccine outside of a hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
TASS reported that virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Set up points for intranasal vaccination at airports and shopping malls may be easier, but I would do this initially only at medical facilities.
The probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable for a person to stay near the doctor's office after receiving it.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy medications that work literally within a minute or two, which can be very useful sometimes," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centers can be done when experience in using the drug has been accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

Sky News is reporting on this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.

Peskov warned of suffering for Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said a Kremlin official on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It has been reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Washington and the European Union are also planning to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to convert rubles into dollars.
Sberbank head German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, a overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
On December 12th, French television channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
Invalidated the results of 2.99% of ballots.
The voter turnout on this day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is attributed to separatist calls to abstain from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
The 1998 Agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration allows the region to organize a referendum on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

The World Health Organization preliminarily considers "omega" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than the delta-strain of coronavirus.
There is also data indicating a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("severity of illness" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", - the WHO technical report states.
The Organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are progressing either mildly or asymptomatically.
Meanwhile, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta".
Two cases of Omikron-strain infection have been registered in Russia.
They had previously been immunized, reported the Gamalei Center.
Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky have been named in Ukraine.
Ex-MP of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios of development for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
He believes that the head of state may lose Western support and may also be willing to compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
Denisenko's first option, which he called the "ideal storm," suggests that Ukraine will be abandoned by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its involvement.
Such developments could lead to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices of key commodities that we traditionally export are decreasing <...> internal protests and resistance to the government from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups) are increasing," added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may be willing to compromise on Donbas, which could result in internal opposition within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, according to a former MP, the probability of such a situation is 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population and the President who disagree with Zelensky, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In such a scenario, Zelensky will start "reformatting of power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario - transforming Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This could be brought about by some event that would be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario could result from a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
The Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11th, survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the approval rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming Ukrainian presidential elections, only 21.8% of the vote would go to current President Zelensky, while 14.5% would go to former President Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very saddening to learn this.

I am buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.

Arrested for a rally on Red Square, the poet said: "Ten days for a quote from Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained at Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetforrussiaismorethanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol for an administrative article on a repeated violation of the order of conducting a public action.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now unfortunately the interest in it has been lost, to the decline of culture in general in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to further explore the message of his poem.
How were you treated by the police officers during this and previous arrests?
What did they ask in the department about your action?
This time the staff were more polite, the detention was as courteous as possible, however funny that may sound in some contexts of the word.
The OMON forces were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
Asked the usual, about the motives.
When heard, they looked at it with understanding, if not approval.
Except for the four-way monkey-barring, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
If at least a few people start writing their own poems after this hashtag action, I won't have wasted these 10 days.
Max, according to the protocol, talk privately in the Tumba-Yumba tribal language.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone understands what happened in Bonn on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
It's just a protocol, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and yet still uses an interpreter.
At official events, stenography is done by hand according to the old-fashioned way, and the stenographer does not have to know multiple languages.

Researchers have revealed how potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
Carrot root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folate and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the systems of the organism to function.
Additionally, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or steamed, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes, like other high-glycemic index foods, can be dangerous for diabetics.
These are carbohydrate-rich foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in their production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be offset by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search results.
Outbound Candidates
In 2015, copyright holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites in the Russian-language internet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search engine results from both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "The Calamari Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is what is known as a bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.

Well, to each their own.
I really liked "Tarkhun", not the current one, of course.
The juices in tall glass cylinders were very delicious.
Three servings of syrup is too much for my taste.
We were two of a kind.
Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimat Orthopedic Spring Mattress
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces of varying softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product is made with only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micro-package" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated to each sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
Their functioning provides a unique point-to-point adjustment.
The "Micro-Package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered with latex, the other is covered with coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been considered classic, as it provides the mattress not only with orthopedic, but also with anatomical properties.
If coil provides proper back support, then latex gives surface adaptation to the body of the person.
Cover: Model comes in a stretchy Aloe Vera jersey cover.
The client can have it either as a removable or stationary, as desired.
Overall height of the product is 27 cm, recommended load capacity for the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Warranty and Security: Warranty Period - 3 Years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Actual Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then search for life there.
Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds for the project.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Assuming we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth life or different.
If it looks very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
"If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mikkel Pajusalu, leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project.

Metaverse will transform Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
Intergalactic should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
They are the logical continuation of the trend of digital assetization, where any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred into a digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy or unhealthy.
Of course, we will have a holiday feast with traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
Have a spoonful, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
How much hard work, time, and resources did she need for her training.
After completing five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
She also understands that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
Do not judge if you have not been involved in sports or cannot imagine the circles of hell she has gone through.
The British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know if the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity had run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates would be correlated with expected GDP growth rates, taking inflation into account.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, a continuation of ultra-loose economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Furthermore, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Mikhail Shulgin, the head of the Global Research Department at Open Investments, previously reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, although the potential for growth will be less significant.
Shulgin listed the risks to the dollar exchange rate as the Federal Reserve's monetary and credit policy, oil price dynamics, and fears related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself to five years ago, there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is slow but steady.
There is also the problem that there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars in the 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than for the same period of the previous year, according to the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To put it into perspective, roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
Kia is the leading Korean brand in the Russian market in terms of revenue.
Over the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia, the sister brand of Hyundai, saw an even greater increase of more than 35%, with car sales revenue estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
Hyundai has been leading the way in terms of brand and increasing the average car price - over the year, Hyundai's average car price has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase dynamic.
However, sales volumes of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Automakers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Toyota completes the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese, Mercedes-Benz had a turnover of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - both the volume of sales (up 37%) and the average weighted price of the car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles) increased for the German premium brand.
Mercedes-Benz has seen a good growth in sales and average price - more than BMW, for example - which has led to a greater financial capacity, explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji.
Chinese brands have demonstrated fantastic growth in sales, significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth demonstrates average indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
Last year, companies with a financial capacity whose car sales in units dropped in 2021, in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
In the face of supply chain issues and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly adjust their prices and those of other automakers for their products.
Russian car market volumes in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the context of car shortages, I think many car manufacturers have been able to partially pass on to consumers the costs of previous periods that they were unable to incorporate into the price of cars before.
Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital, speaks on the automotive industry.
I believe that automakers are feeling very good financially right now, supporting a high margin of sales.
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices observed throughout 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantity and in money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, and automakers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and limited supply, automakers are now striving to maximize their profits from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
No increase in the production of cars is expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by the citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, according to an expert.
Biden spoke about the redeployment of US military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
President of the United States Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There were never any plans," the White House head declared in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a solemn obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - Biden said.
Previously, Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukraine's territory.
He also indicated that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I'm leaving such interviews right away.
If they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some strange slop and wash another cup at the interview, it's scary to think what will happen at work.
I will find a good place to work without a middleman, where I can talk directly to the manager.

If a scammer calls from a similar number claiming to be a "law enforcement officer" or other law enforcement agency, it is not effective to hang up immediately, but it is likely not possible to add it to a blacklist.

I can even smile at you on the outside.
