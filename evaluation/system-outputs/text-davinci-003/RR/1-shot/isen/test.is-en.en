Cry out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gotten off to a good start and the calls and cries out in nature are beginning to draw people from all over the world.
"You need the puzzle, I need Iceland," says a woman from the outside world in response to the advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube channel.
Another spectator declared that they would keep Iceland in their heart forever and a young woman said she would definitely be the first to get to Iceland, as her beloved is settled there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore it is expected that we will have to wait for another month.
Another viewer asks if the route to Iceland is available, since there are no planes.
It is not stated in the story whether he comes from another time period.
Egill Thordarson from the advertising agency Peel, who created the ads in collaboration with the international agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been better than expected.
I have been on many Inspired By Iceland trips that have gone very well, but this new trip is already surpassing expectations.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to talk about the tour, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in over seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of approximately two billion people.
The value of the discussion is estimated at 1.8 billion kroner.
That's not acceptable.
The main market is the United States and the campaign has been going very well there even though Americans are not traveling to the country anytime soon.
According to Egil, markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also taken well to the product, as has Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then there have been responses from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically planned for.
"These ads have gone further than we expected," says Egill, noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer from Morgunblaðið, for advertisements bearing the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The shots were taken widely, such as at Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti Productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
In the lead roles in the play were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Hundreds of Icelanders came to shoot the commercials, while at the same time another group was on the West Coast and Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland journey, with plans for a winter journey in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Agency," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone exceptionally well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about.
Pension: Discuss the situation in the labor market, pension fund and much more.
Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, will attend the meeting at Sprengisand starting at ten o'clock today at Bylgja.
He is also the Minister of Employment and oversees the situation in the labor market, the Icelandair issue, and other matters.
He also oversees rural affairs and the relocation of jobs to rural areas which have been struggling and controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman of VR, will also be present in the program and will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and present ideas for labor unions and businesses to withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then, Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel service provider in East Iceland, and Arnheidur Johannsdottir, the Director of the Northern Region Marketing Board, will discuss the status of travel services in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the autumn and ponder whether the success of the summer is a foreboding of what is to come.
You can listen to the episode here below, starting at 10 o'clock.
This is what she looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teen shows.
She still gained fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn't had much luck lately, but she managed to look back on her past and talk about Clueless on Australian TV recently.
She speaks fondly of Brittany Murphy who unexpectedly passed away in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I encountered in school who weren't kind to me.
"As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
I did not want to leave the police station after an overnight stay.
Fifty cases were reported to the police in the capital region today, and the police logbook states that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after being detained there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police officers who told him to leave.
The man earned himself a continuous stay at the police station due to his progress.
A man was arrested this morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to take action against two people in Breiðholt due to a report of physical assault.
Then it also happened that a woman who was eating at a restaurant in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
Also, there was an announcement of a car theft in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van lost sight of it for a moment and it was then taken without permission.
The car has not been found.
The Division of Joy - The Terrible Fate of the Gleestars
The theory has gained traction on the internet that the cast of Glee is cursed, as actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third main cast member to pass away before their time.
The episodes of Glee are a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes revolved around a so-called youth joy club in a high school, their loves and destinies.
It was not always taken for granted to be part of the joyous group, but through song and dance the characters seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
Outside the set, there have been major disruptions to the actors and crew of the show, so much so that speculation has arisen that a curse lies on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, Glee, who didn't always call her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child with him, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th of last year, it was announced that River was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life vest on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped overboard and then Rivera had pulled him back into the boat but had never returned himself.
A large-scale search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area concluded that the search should be conducted on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is said that she had encountered a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
Death was attributed to drunkenness due to accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to fame and respect.
Outside of the roles, Moneith still interacted with personal demons.
From the age of 13 he had struggled with addiction and it proved difficult to escape from it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show found enough cause, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneth then went into treatment and it seemed that everything was looking up.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
The cocktail proved to be a pleasant mix of spices and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a case of intent.
Monieth had undergone treatment and his tolerance for stimulants had decreased so much that even small amounts he had previously tolerated well, proved to be toxic.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His passing weighed heavily on his co-stars, but in support of his on-screen love, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue shooting the episodes and dedicate them to the memory of Monteith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee club members, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
Upon searching his home, a large amount of child pornography was found and the matter was quickly made public.
It was clear that Salling had been done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison in addition to having to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had imposed the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found to be living close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the players of the show that fell far behind in age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He was suddenly taken in sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
The feature was also worked on by a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of movie star Julia Roberts and did not have a pleasant relationship with her sister, accusing Roberts of heavy-handedness and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her beloved in which she said her mother and sister, among others, were responsible for how she had come to be.
My mother and so-called siblings of mine will get nothing from me except the memory that it was them who endured all my worst moods.
Lea Michel was the star of the shows.
She has recently been accused of using her power and influence inappropriately at her workplace and being overly authoritative.
Jesse Luken had a guest role in the episodes in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a serious offense.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the episodes.
In 2010, she was the victim of computer hackers who obtained and published nude photos of her on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had a relationship outside of the show.
Benoist later testified that Jenner had used violence in the relationship.
Flowers can be put on almost anything.
It increases children's maturity when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and bloom.
There is also endless possibilities with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the air, and of course that precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think there are many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who does fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Fishing is a very convenient summer job when one is in school.
If fishing is successful, it is possible to have good income and I find it great to be able to avoid taking out student loans.
"The earnings are also good for me in the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who has been doing beach fishing in the summer like the past summers.
Axel was the latest to arrive at the dock in Tálknafjörður when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the start of the week.
During the year I was in tenth grade, I obtained a boat captain's license for boats under twelve meters long, and I bought my own boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have been fishing from my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat used from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and had stopped going to sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
"Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
I had the boat debt-free by the end of my first summer with it.
How could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished high school?
I had already saved up some money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my savings into my boat fund.
Axel was born in Isafjordur, where all of his family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the west because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Isafjordur.
I learned to sail in this area here west of town with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be west of here, I have also explored around Snæfellsnes and further.
"I also provide for the south, mostly grey plovers," says Axel, who always stirs up a fire early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in his moments of solitude out on the beach.
The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting seasick, but certainly something has been happening occasionally, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In fishing, I'm never out for more than 14 hours at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, such as the lease quota, where I've been out on the sea for a full and a half solar cycle fishing."
He states that the regulations for fishing in the sea allow him to catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds satisfactory.
Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, during these four months that the coastal fishing season is open, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to take vacation days instead of having 48 days off throughout the summer and being able to choose for themselves.
"So the zoning could go my way and areas well situated for fishing should be able to benefit from it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the deep sea on his trawling trips, as well as some haddock and occasional other species.
Axel works over the winter with his college degree at the Núpi daycare in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors who work in the country's kindergartens," says Axel proudly and adds that he had only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I got stuck there because I find this job amazing.
"I hope that the psychology studies will be useful to me in the future at the elementary school level," says Axel, who is also far along in his studies of business.
An error in the registration prevented the homecoming gift.
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they enter the country resulted in an individual, residing here, not being called back for a check-up.
There is no requirement to provide a social security number if the individual completes the form in English, as is the case when it is completed in Icelandic.
"This will be looked at in the week," says an expert at the Public Health Department.
Three domestic cases were diagnosed at the Infectious Diseases Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on the so-called homecoming test took effect.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and invited for a test four to five days later.
RÚV's evening news reported that the individual had, however, followed the old system.
The border inspection was negative and he was not called back for the inspection due to the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of public health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the digital registration form.
Completing the registration form in English is not a requirement to enter a social security number as is the case with the Icelandic version.
Ultimately, it has primarily been designed for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the person has not received an automatic invitation to attend the examination.
Camilla says that many have followed the rules of homecoming allowance even though they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
This will be reviewed during the week to see how to make it easier for people to access this to draw attention to the process.
The person is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went to the screening, but two had already shown symptoms.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three cases that were identified yesterday, and is mostly completed for the two cases that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic gene sequencing has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the restrictions have been directed at Israel even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear by tomorrow where the other wind is coming from.
There are now a total of 15 in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
There are 135 in quarantine.
Four out of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic cases have been identified in the country in recent days.
Of those, four are entirely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that arose at the Rey Cup Sports Tournament yesterday has not yet been identified.
The risk of infection is still present.
Originally, thirty individuals were sent into quarantine but that number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 cases of infection due to these new infections that were identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johansson, Communications Manager of the National Police Commissioner's Department, says it is perfectly possible as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
We are constantly reminding all those living here that individual protective measures must be maintained.
We also need to remind people who are hosting events that there are certain rules in place that must be followed.
"It is possible to hold an event," says Johann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual protective measures.
Rules and criteria should also be subject to ongoing review.
What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Department and the National Board of Health are constantly emphasizing to people, is to adhere to these individual protective measures.
Both in-house and likewise with service providers.
People should wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
"It prevents the spread of infection," says Johann.
We need to encourage people to continue on the good path that we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far.
40% of COVID-19 fatalities had diabetes type 2.
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was having to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was gone.
The death was attributed to rapid respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is fearful that he too may soon pass away.
Reuters news agency reports that Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Numbers from a new study commissioned by US authorities show that approximately 40% of those tested were found to have type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the ratio of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the ratio increases to half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study tracked more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters conducted a survey with a slow growth rate and the responses from the 12 countries that responded were similar in proportion.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, have yet to recognize underlying illnesses.
Diabetes was already spreading at a slow rate.
Now, COVID-19 has broken out “like a powerful storm,” according to Reuters quoting Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among Blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fared worse in the coronavirus pandemic.
The best protection for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and support from healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain their routine over the past weeks.
The high cost of insulin has caused some to continue to go to work and avoid being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities may have been aware of the risks posed to those with type 2 diabetes from the virus.
When SARS coronavirus spread in 2003, approximately 20% of those infected were affected, and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to require hospitalization.
When MERS first emerged in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the effects of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic could have longer-term implications for uncovering a variety of previously unknown co-morbidities.
"I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including new diseases and new syndromes.
Direct new research to determine if coronavirus can lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the connection between coronavirus and diabetes type 2.
Diabetes can affect the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high ratio of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a real "hypoglycemic storm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and overwhelms the body.
Disruptions in intake can also lead to turbulence which can in turn cause dangerous blood loss.
"It's all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It all ties in together."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered a toast, so they left the barracks"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were presented with the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was setting up in Paris.
"We love each other so this wasn't difficult."
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother-in-law, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
I was very impressed by her.
It was naturally just the surprise, but it seemed to me also quite unbearably sweet.
"And yet it seems," he says.
Asrun likes this too, as her husband regularly recites the first meeting.
I'm always hearing this story.
"Just last weekend," she says, laughing, recalling her first meeting with her husband.
I found and still find so much fuss around Atli, which I dislike.
There is a lot going on and a lot happening and I am excited about it.
Atli says the couple has emphasized going their own ways in their relationship.
We don't tie our bags in the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We adhere to routines that we establish around us.
There may be a reason why they took the commission from Ragnar Kjartansson the artist only reluctantly, though it was to say the least unusual.
Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, is in contact with us and is asking if we can come to have dessert with her, Ragga, and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, at Snaps.
They ordered the appetizers, met the trio at Snaps and got themselves a dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art exhibition he was planning to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-screen video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Asrún says that he has described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and lastly he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in it.
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was meant to show a young interracial couple in love in a minimalistic room.
"These are journeys with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar very well even though they had heard of him and he of them, "but they knew us and it seemed to fit."
They had agreed that they would not advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others.
They called for Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, and it didn't take long.
When we ran out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just in this for the fun?
That's just the way it is.
"I trusted Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
This is about love and closeness.
Senan was taken up in a nice apartment on Myrargata Street.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar, and the soundman and couple.
After the recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Asrun.
We had not decided how we should be.
We got some brief instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
"There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
Was this romantic?
"Yes, that was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered a toast before they left the barracks.
It was kind of like being on a luxurious vacation in Paris.
The team was pleased with the participant's performance in the task that moved them.
"When Tommi the viewer saw this, he cried, it was so beautiful to him," says Atli.
"This is as much about love and closeness as it is about the relationships themselves," says Ásrún.
The parents of the artist have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard his voice in the piece at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to ponder this," says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this yet, but then my dad sends me a message saying, "It's great to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And do you think participation in the project has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
We are still together anyway, so maybe this deepened something.
This deepened my connection with the extended family," says Ásrún with a laugh.
Ásrún saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
"It was a bit hard for me not to be with you or someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
It was fun to see this because it is just one scene in a much larger work and when you saw this with the other works it was very nice.
I was able to detach myself from this a bit and was just proud.
"And there was a little bump in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was already pregnant with the couple's second child when the test was taken.
"That was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Ásrún and Atli on Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous playoff match
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the teams' previous match in the playoffs to get promoted to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0–0.
Home fans in Swansea were awarded a penalty in the 64th minute, and Andre Ayew stepped up to take the penalty and fired it past the goalkeeper.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with one man less and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage of the numerical superiority.
Andre Ayew then increased the excitement by scoring a fantastic goal and secured a 1–0 victory for Swansea.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the match, and the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Without an ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported yesterday that he wanted to have an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
It has not been smooth sailing for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst left her post as the US Ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Falcon Award.
On her way to a farewell reception with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be honored with the award.
After she left Iceland, she taught International Relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came into office in September 2010.
It can be partly attributed to Robert S. Connan having been appointed as ambassador but then resigning.
Finally, Louis Ariega took the job, having worked in the foreign service for decades.
He left his job in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then began a second period without ambassadors.
Robert Barber was approved by the US Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly afterwards, as there had been no ambassador in place for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short-term election fund for Barack Obama.
He resigned when Donald Trump took office as President on January 20th, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually quick to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington bureaucracy.
Two years passed until the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their session to question him on the oaths and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before the assembly, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, while his late wife had been of Dutch mountain descent.
Gunter is politically organized, was formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson founded the organizations, and Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter started working in Iceland in May 2019, and since early 2017, no ambassador had been in the country for two years and four months, which is the longest example here.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was taking to appoint people to key positions as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been drawn out considerably, including confirming ambassadors to posts.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for about five years.
This has not prevented the activities of the embassy which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The works are estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, and reinforced security walls surround the building with bulletproof glass in all windows.
It appears, however, that it has not been enough to secure the current ambassador, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested to be provided with armed protection.
Former IBV player faced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland."
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of IBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This was revealed in an interview with Tonny that was published in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In his interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country when he played with IBV, Val and Throttur in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the midfield like I was used to.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the field during his time with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny speaks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This once happened to me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard more about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He admits to having made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tony had not been able to make it into the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make it into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and he then joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
"I think if I had stayed in Norway longer, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who was hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would likely get further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has put an end to his dreams of making it big in Europe.
A woman found a snake in her neck.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black snake in the throat of a woman who had come there for treatment.
The doctors were able to pull the worm out with tongs.
Research revealed that it was a reptile.
CNN explains this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of raw meat, a few days before.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but reptiles like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
Since sushi has gained popularity in the West, cases of people being infected by parasites have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in a state of emergency in relation to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, and authorities have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus anew.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, while in the UK everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Cases are also increasing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and getting the economy back on track.
The situation in Europe is still good compared to other parts of the world, but new infections worldwide are approaching 300 thousand per day, with the highest numbers in America and South Asia.
Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 16 million worldwide, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths linked to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Mosaic Work Finally Gets to Enjoy Its Fulfillment
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
Below her are people with orange helmets.
There is also a big ditch.
And more minor tools.
The street is closed to traffic.
And the walkway is narrow and now many people stand there and admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least do not assume it.
The work has been somewhat neglected up to now, directly in front of it there were always busy parking lots.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then left to attend to their business in the city center.
"Vibrant and diverse public spaces" and "an inviting urban landscape" are guiding principles for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata which is now underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at the Tollhouse to be better appreciated.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The list work will be described and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter floor.
The area will also feature small "mist gardens", a kind of water sculpture, which offer play and give the area a certain atmosphere.
With this approach, the City of Reykjavik is described as being committed to the implementation along with the Municipalities.
Water, heating and electricity supplies will be renewed.
Many of them have been around for years, but the sewer and cold water systems date back to 1925 and have thus served the residents and businesses in the downtown area for almost a century.
Once the works are completed, cars can drive on the street again.
However, it will be unified and at the same time create quieter and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
According to the Customs Office website, the Customs House was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor breeze passing through the house, 250 square meters of wall-to-wall carpeting was formed out to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such additions would have a negative effect on the overall appearance of the house, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed to arrange for the installation of a permanent artwork there.
At this time, much was said about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and beyond.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether a competition for the job would be held.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect life at the harbor, after all, the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was established.
When the artist was spoken to, she was deeply moved by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some suggestions for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, a comprehensive agreement was sought with her and the famous artworks company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long been working with them on the setup of famous artworks throughout Europe.
The agreements were made and Gerður completed the artwork under the setup of the brothers' workshop, who then took care of the setup of the Customs House.
The entire project was exceptionally well handled, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmann Brothers, according to the summary.
It has since endured the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The list woman died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares for the relocation of several institutions abroad.
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public institutions will be moved out to the countryside in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the episode "Sprengisandi on the Wave" in the morning.
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Employment Agency's paint department will be relocated to Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Six experts in the field of fire safety work for the organization, but none of them intend to follow the organization north and the National Association of Fire and Rescue Services has criticized the relocation plans.
I think we should take further steps in this direction.
I am preparing further steps in this process.
"Further transfers," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think we need to take further political decisions about moving public services out to the countryside, like I was doing with the Housing and Business Agency," said Ásmundur, and he also gave examples of other agencies that have been moved out to the countryside and made a big difference for communities out there, such as the relocation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes, and unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
All the highlights from the second day of the Championship
The Icelandic National Championships in Athletics concluded at Thorsvellir in Akureyri today.
Some records were set on the last competition day.
It was calculated that there would be an exciting competition in women's shot put at Thorswell, and Vigdis Jonsdottir from FH set the Icelandic record in shot put in 2014, which stood until Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in great form since then, having tripled the Icelandic Championship record since then.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with an injury and was unable to play today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt, setting a new record.
Her Icelandic record set earlier in July was 62.69 meters, so she was still somewhat short of that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day and she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH athlete Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's representative in the hammer throw, won a convincing victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his penultimate throw and set a new record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and Icelandic representative in discus throw, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvelli yesterday and today he competed in discus throw which is his main event.
Iceland's Guðni Val's record is 65.53 meters, but he threw 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today with one valid throw of 49.43 meters, good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's long jump champion, won the long jump competition with a remarkable performance as she jumped 6.25 meters today, which is just 40 cm short of her own Icelandic record.
In the 200 meter women's race, it was Icelandic runner Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, although her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri yesterday, winning two gold medals in the 100-meter dash and the 4 x 100-meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400-meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
Not penalized for a 27 million krona Bitcoin transaction
The appeals committee has rejected the claim of the tax investigator who demanded a penalty against a person for underreporting their income derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator had not provided clear evidence as to why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax inspector found the person to be in breach of incorrect tax declarations for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had failed to report his income from the sale of Bitcoin up to 27 million, either willfully or through gross negligence.
Punish the man for his misconduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He went ahead with selling cryptocurrency for 27 million in 2016.
He had acquired it with a grant in 2009 and 2010 when such had been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implications of such a sale had been highly unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been impossible to expect ordinary citizens to be aware of such regulations on tax returns.
He had not expected to avoid paying taxes on the gain and had declared his assets on the tax return as deposits in a bank account.
He had asked both experts and the tax authority how this should be handled, but without success.
He then considered that he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started mining for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to understand complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man deemed it right that his taxes for these two fiscal years would be reassessed and a penalty imposed, but otherwise no punishment.
He reiterated that he had been living in Iceland and had been paying taxes in the country since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his duties in an irresponsible manner.
The demand for payment would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur is making a name for himself: "This man understands what football is about."
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a great asset to people, but also has stirred up admiration due to his success in his time playing with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max Division.
Sparks will fly in the arena tonight when they take on IA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is given a game ban due to four warnings during the game and therefore does not show up to the game with a new haircut as he has done in the games of the season so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his shirt for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
I don't know who exactly he was paying with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wanted to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone to even out this game then I thought he would do it or make it happen," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max studio, when the conversation turned to Brynjólfi.
"I'm here for the people."
It can be difficult sometimes to understand where one is at.
He looks to the left side a bit when the game is winding down, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson calls Brynjólf a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the team: "There is no doubt that this is character.
This is a fun type and I love it with the hair, and always being ready to attend and answer in interviews.
There are an incredible amount of people taken by him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
I am a entertainer.
I'm here for the people and to have a good time.
People are reading Brynjólf's conversations, people are paying attention and following what is next on his agenda.
"This man is just brilliant," said Máni.
Player KR stated that he wants to leave the team - "I have been in contact with some teams in Division B."
Tobias Thomsen, a player for KR in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
"The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in conversation with Bold.
I have been in contact with some teams in Division B and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.
He then says that he will likely have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
Organizations in Denmark have likely been more affected by the economic impacts of the virus than in Iceland.
Bicycle courier Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Now accountable after discussion with DV
For the past few years, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the Bicycle Whisperer" for his work.
Yesterday, there was quite a stir when someone revealed their interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Westside Facebook group where it was suggested that Bjartmar had spoken to the man at Austurvellir and suggested that the Vespa might be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original documents of the electrician that Bjartmar had robbed him.
The text has now been edited on Facebook and the original headline of DV has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar's initial reports of the matter do not accurately reflect what actually happened yesterday at Austurvegur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the informant of the electricity theft that these were indeed their electricity meters.
The information the alleged owner received from others proved to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
I looked at the cow and I recognized the scooter, and with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and had been searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off in the car I decided to take the chance to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his case and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I was doing very well in this kind of situation, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word.
Bjartmar says that the man with the skateboard offered him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted out."
So the owner of the laptop verified ownership of their laptop and left.
Later, the rightful owner of the laptop told his story on Facebook, as reported in the earlier news.
In this short year that Bjartmar has devoted to this skill, he claims to be able to count the divisions he came up with on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest people in Reykjavik," said Bjartmar, pointing out that cyclists are often the least of society's brothers and sisters, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"Debt is a harsh master and somehow you have to finance the next step, unfortunately theft of such loose funds is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
My interactions with this people are so good that I have brought many of the good people with me to the team.
Examples of people going into treatment and taking responsibility and then coming to me for help with what I'm doing,” he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists should be courteous.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer to kindly show him receipts, bicycle serial numbers and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started to point people to him due to the electric scooters.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news report from DV and claims to not be some kind of self-appointed police in a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is still not on top of the situation with his competence, and whether this is not primarily the job of the police, Bjartmar certainly says so.
Of course, the law should do this, but the reality is that the law is simply not addressing this.
For example, I have seen police officers drive away from a large swarm of scooters.
She is, quite frankly, powerless in these matters.
"If the law isn't doing anything about this, and it's right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can get results in this area, then why not?" Bjartmar asks.
He claims to have achieved such success in riding his unicycle that sometimes he would surprise his "fellow riders" on the street who had just gotten their own Bjartmari unicycles.
The occasions on which Bjartmar has called for police assistance have resulted in her not showing up at all.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bike owners,” said Bjartmar, and he finds it unfortunate that victims of bike theft have to suffer from the lack of police action in this category of cases.
There is no disagreement about Bjartmar's success.
Widely, stories can be found of people thanking Bjartmar for having returned their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts naturally run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, electric bikes, and electric carts weigh heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a daycare during the week and works at a cafe on the weekends.
His hobby of cycling is the unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a milestone year in the history of Icelandic pension funds.
Civil servants had indeed received pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general employees was then established with collective bargaining agreements in the labor market in 1969, where it was agreed upon to have occupational pension funds with mandatory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were then set based on these agreements and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for workers was not the only significant change that the labor movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle.
Unemployment benefits had been won in similar fashion in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also achieved some success in their demands for health care and pension rights, substantial vacation rights, reduction of working hours, housing allowances and other such matters of great importance.
All these rights were hard-won and fiercely contested, but in the end proved to be much more lasting and beneficial than the wage increases that were wiped out by the inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The process leading to the establishment of public pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complex.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would be the property of the fund members, the labor movement insisted that their management should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members in equal numbers.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of the workforce in the fund's management was often discussed in the wage-earner associations, but it never succeeded, and so we are still stuck with the unnatural situation that representatives of the fund associations are not in the majority in the fund's management.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on Pension Security and Pension Fund Activity discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first clause states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the fund members as its guiding principle."
Also, Article 5 states: "The pension fund shall set ethical criteria for its investments."
The Investment Policy of the Merchant's Pension Fund includes, among other things, the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, in addition to good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment performance of bond portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society are brought together in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, set a public policy on: good corporate governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi pension fund, one of the largest funds in the country, has set a "policy on responsible investments" with similar provisions.
This is all outlined here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic buzzword, "shadow governance".
Where the term is used in the context, it is not expected to have been defined, but the following definition seems to be the "most taken": Shadow governance is when a leader of a corporate entity states in the media that they intend to send representatives of the company to the board of a pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how they should take a stance on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow management" after all, as such interactions between people are of course always present in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to consider which path he finds "more shadowy."
There are mainly two people who have tried to define this when it was written, on Saturday morning, July 25th, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, a bank manager.
The occasion for both was created after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his plan to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and pilots (lay them off), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Reykjavík Merchants' Association, sent out those recommendations to the association's representatives on the board of the Merchants' Pension Fund to not support any potential purchase of the fund's shares in the company, or they might be made to withdraw.
Later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and subsequently, Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations that were obviously in line with Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw cause to elaborate on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with strong words about shadow governance, lawbreaking, and the urgent need for legal reform.
There was indeed a small tuft that had to bear a heavy burden, even though the blessed tuft had been in a state of connection and in addition had been dried out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let's keep the subject itself in mind in the end.
I have previously mentioned here the provisions in the pension fund laws that relate to this matter.
This includes that fund managers must act in the best interests of fund members and have ethical considerations in investments, and these items are further detailed in the agreements of both the Trade Union and the Pension Fund as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT only look at short-term return objectives in their investments.
Such would be a highly risky policy and one need not look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have been given to irresponsible speculators and environmental polluters, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on a high when he came up with the idea to lay off a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he realized his mistake and retracted it.
Time will tell whether investing pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes to the crunch.

One of the infected did not have a travel history.
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from the Baltic States on July 15th, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not resident here by habit and therefore did not receive clear instructions to take the so-called entry test after arriving in the country and to take another test a few days after arrival.
He received a negative result from the border check.
"But he is in an Icelandic society and in reality should have gone into that solution," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the health department of the National Health Service and the acting health officer while he is on summer break, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form and there is no requirement to register the national identification number and if the national identification number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second show.
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but due to his connection to the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic one instead.
He had not realized this.
If your ID number is not registered, you will need to arrange for a later exam yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
Thus, it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic booking system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow clearer who the participants in the Icelandic society are in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the individual is accepted upon arrival in the country, even if they are defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in close contact with him.
They are due to go for a test but two of them have already shown symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his test at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it is likely that he had recently been infected with the virus that it had not yet been able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to exclude the possibility that the man was infected here in Iceland and did not bring the virus with him to the country.
It is not entirely possible to assert that this is definitely an imported case, as it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here, like the two who have caused some disruption in relation to the sporting event.
She says, however, that it is very unlikely due to how few people are around here.
"It's highly unlikely," says Kamilla, but she points out that it can't be ruled out until Icelandic genetic testing has identified the virus in the person.
If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that it has been brought into the country.
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters
Clashes between police and protesters broke out in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and gender discrimination were widely protested in the United States yesterday evening, with the protests in Seattle in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests in Seattle.
A group of people then set fire to the construction site and broke windows at the city courthouse.
Subsequently, the police declared the protests to be unruly and clashes ensued between the groups of protesters and the police.
Protesters demanded justice for Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was killed by police in Aurora, Colorado last August.
The car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed by police in her home in March of last year.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation to closed intersections where police held back the group of people protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old Black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our era
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't lose against Wolves, then Solskjær and his team will end up in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
They should still have hope of making it to the Master Division by winning the European Division next month.
We are not at the end yet.
"If we get a result against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad season," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to do to catch up with the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that the substitutes will be called at 3 pm today, but Solskjaer tried to act as if it were any other game.
If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the society is built on this.
"We have created a great opportunity to end the period well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
This is not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the soccer team, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments that define this period.
"Bruno Fernandes has made a big difference for us and I think overall we are in better shape and stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 cases per solar cycle
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday according to Johns Hopkins University.
Altogether, 4,178,021 cases of infection have been confirmed in the West since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
900 died due to the virus yesterday, and in the last four days the death toll due to the virus has been over 1,000 per day.
In total, 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the US health authorities' prediction is that the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Fear of another wave of the pandemic
The authorities in Spain are now trying with weak measures to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
No more cases have been reported in a single solar cycle since the beginning of May and the news comes as the Spanish begin to ease one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlash resulted in British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
A week ago, Spain was on the UK's list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain where authorities have taken more extensive measures to try to contain the spread.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will be closed at midnight.
Then, a curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand inhabitants in the Segria county in western Catalonia.
It is estimated that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly affected by the pandemic.
TUI, the largest travel agency in Britain, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there appears to be little interest in reimposing the widespread lockdowns that have crippled the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very dim view of such and such like nuclear weapons which he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide lockdown were to be imposed again.
Many advisors hope that localized measures that target individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to contain the virus if it returns in the next wave.
Five new cases of infection in Iceland - Three within the country.
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday in addition to two cases at the border.
Five individuals were confirmed to have tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
The public health announcement states that one infection is linked to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
He has been placed in isolation and sixteen people who were in close contact with him have been quarantined.
The infected person was a participant in a sports club activity in Reykjavík and, according to the announcement, "only members of the sports team" are in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine are connected to the person in another way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and contact tracing is underway by the National Police Commissioner's contact tracing team.
Participants of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the health and safety authorities that are still in effect and appropriate measures have been taken.
Yesterday's match pictures drew attention, where it could be seen in very close proximity celebrating the good performance of their team on the field.
At 11am today, the organizers released the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Please note: Parents are kindly requested to ensure that competitors collect their own equipment at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was identified yesterday that is related to the infection reported the day before.
The announcement states: "Icelandic genetic testing has identified the infection and revealed a new strain of virus that has not been identified here before."
Work is being done on the infection as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He was identified in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in the sick bay.
Two of them have already shown signs of virus infection.
In addition, two border crossings were closed and further investigations are pending, as the protocols for border crossings dictate.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Security Department of the National Police and the Directorate of Health urge people to be vigilant and adhere to individual protective measures against infection.
Play it safe and ask the same person to go for a Covid-19 test at the nearest health center if any of the symptoms of the virus are present.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the merchants' weekend - Direct guests elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are encouraged to explore other accommodation options.
Other options in the area include Vesturbyggð Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes á Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town, just like in previous years.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Due to the popularity of the campsite, a good turnout is expected this year, provided the weather does not interfere, as DV reported earlier today from their forecast.
However, one should be prepared for the worst weather to the south, and hope for the best for the people of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is was the first to report, saying that all other accommodations in the town were already booked.
A whole block of houses nestles down in the best spot in the city.
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are still waiting for building permits for renovations, their applications have been backlogged in the system for three years.
In the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhood of Reykjavik stands a beautiful three-story apartment building.
The ground floor of the house has about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases each containing four quite nice apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history to tell.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store of the Milk Association, a tailor shop, a fish store, and most recently, a university print shop.
The house has, so to speak, been given a new lease of life.
The house is now under considerable damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 Ltd.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus represented the shareholders of Borgun and was the defender of the asset management company Borgun.
Among the owners of the asset management company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.
Steel Ship Ltd. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also an owner of a third share in D18 Ltd.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the Stálskip company.
D18 ehf. purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little to nothing to maintain it since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has been steadily deteriorating since, especially in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood's residents, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
Owners have been striving for several years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
It is long overdue to do something about this mess and unfortunate that it has dragged on for so long.
He also says that he is out of pocket for not having driven himself to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and end this "legal quagmire".
Do this in consultation with the community around so that it can be driven and completed.
The "legal framework" referred to is the organizational process of the court that has been in place since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build an additional floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator building, and an extension of one floor plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for the project was appealed to the Environmental and Property Rights Board and the Board invalidated it as the project did not have a dispute resolution agreement and the boundary survey was not sufficient.
Reykjavík City then started a tender process and concluded it with an announcement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That arrangement was also rescinded and the committee invalidated it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house at the start.
The house had deteriorated significantly by this time and the neighbors had begun to tire of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reactions of the neighbors were varied.
Some had an understanding of the owners' plans, others not at all.
Some directed their course towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily out of any.
Others said the parking lot was overcrowded, but neighbors have been using the unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking lot for their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case claimed to be exhausted by the bureaucracy.
It is completely unbelievable that we have to go through the process in three steps.
It's like the City of Reykjavik can't read.
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A reminder of the city's governance and generous plans of the owner and years of work now at the starting point.
When the newspaperman approached the gate of Dunhaga 18, galloping doors and a rumbling roar greeted him.
A Playstation console and a recent television were among the debris on the ground — the remains of an Icelandic summer cottage.
The old office of the University Press was opened and there were many cats of the local breed to judge.
It is clear that someone has backed themselves into a corner but no visible way out.
Stacks of sofas and rooms and some sheets of geology papers that surely should have been a book, rustled.
The stairwells of the apartment building were open at the same time, and life in both of them.
The journalist was so lucky to stumble upon one of the inhabitants.
There were Romanians cooking a potato dish for dinner and they invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employment agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time and sources close to DV claim that the company has not paid for the accommodation except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not deemed defensible to collect rent.
Judging by the postmarks on the door of the house, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The operation of labor leasing has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector and these two sectors have been the most active in taking advantage of labor leasing services.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work tools and equipment hung in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be in excellent condition.
When the journalist asked the boys about their Romanian background, the coldness was suddenly clear: At the best location in Reykjavík stands a 1,500 square meter property in ruins.
The owners want to renovate the house for improvement and the neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree on the definition of "improvement".
Between them, the city's organizational department is at the starting point, with endless opportunities for complaint and dispute resolution in the organizational process and the decision of the Environmental and Property Rights Board.
In the house there are Romanian workers, perhaps even those who will take over when the Icelanders stop working.
The article was originally published in the Sunday newspaper DV on July 17th.
In response to the weight gain due to the coronavirus pandemic
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds for a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on junk food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, and with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patients to combat obesity and additional measures will be taken to increase the number of bike lanes.
Advertising for fast food will be banned on television before 9pm, according to British media regulations.
"COVID-19 has raised our awareness of the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Minister of Finance is determined that we use this time to become healthier, more active, and to eat healthier food," said a government spokesperson.
Johnson has himself had to contend with weight issues, and he was admitted to hospital when he contracted coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater democracy, prosperity, and working against corruption and for the benefit of the whole.
We need to start making some changes now and who is better suited to lead those changes than the group of society that has an easier time being in those values.
"There are women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are renowned for their gender equality.
To stand together and be together in leading changes.
So now it is up to us to implement these changes.
She said she was somewhat uncomfortable with the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
We are not equally prepared to consider what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It is a slope.
We need to know where we come from, understand the history, and listen.
Listen to the rhythms of the group.
"We don't all follow the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways in a good position in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders build on very patriarchal values.
She said that politics tended to be about self-interest, power and control that were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now established this group and come together and are just a bit frustrated that Parliament seems to be turning a blind eye to this referendum from 2012," she said.
These are the feminine values we are thinking this through from.
"In terms of human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and that we all sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the core values in the new constitution.
We are a very wealthy country of natural resources and it is heartbreaking that there are people living in poverty here.
"It's possible, we can arrange something else," said Helga.
It is unacceptable that women's work is always paid less.
It is unacceptable that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for fair wages.
It is possible to sign the petition for the new constitution here through digital Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he accosted a pedestrian and attempted to take money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðunum where the driver was going 146 km/h where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
Furthermore, he had previously been deprived of driving privileges.
The police in the capital region had plenty to keep them busy last night and around 80 cases were recorded in the police log from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a particular emphasis on compliance notifications.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven loud disturbances were received and it was noted in the police log.
However, 22 charges were laid by police last night.
Six were detained in a jail cell last night.
In Arbaeen, police were called in last night when participants fired fireworks into the sky.
They were, however, ready to defend themselves when the police officer arrived at the gate.
Nine drivers were stopped for alcohol and/or drug offenses.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night and one of them was held in a jail cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West End.
One person was taken to the emergency department after they were injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
Yesterday, police officers also stopped a motorist who was driving a car in Kjalarnes.
According to the police report, the bicycle equipment of the cyclist was in "very poor condition" and it was unsecured.
It is possible to stay at Monet's house during the weekend of the merchants.
The house that impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are around the merchants' holiday.
The house is small and quaint, located in the village of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens at this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it is next available after the weekend of the merchants' holiday, so it might be suitable for some merchants on vacation to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the merchants' weekend cost no more than 964 US dollars or around 130 thousand Icelandic kronur according to Fréttablaðið.
Hundreds have been quarantined and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Hundreds have been quarantined due to this and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two with border control.
An expert from the Public Health Authority says that an increasing number of domestic cases does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
The previous domestic infection has been traced and it is a strain that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community at any time.
This is probably something new to the country but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the disease control department of the National Board of Health.
Most of those infected have been linked to individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests are being carried out in the near future, and some of those who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of coronavirus.
"Now that there is no flu season and fewer other respiratory illnesses, we can be somewhat relaxed about doing these tests on individuals who during flu season would have been considered for something else first," said Kamilla.
The outbreak is mostly over, but it is not ruled out that more people may need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
Has it raised questions as to whether it is defensible to hold such an event?
The public safety director says it is perfectly safe as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Camilla says it is almost certain that the infected people were not infected at the sports event.
If no further individuals go into isolation as a result of having interacted with these individuals at these sporting events, then we can conclude that our safety measures at the events have been effective.
"But it's not clear," said Kamilla.
The work of the public defense department is subject to constant review.
"We need to be prepared to take further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary," said Kamilla.
After a few weeks, the crowd limit will be increased to a thousand people.
This new position could have implications for appointments.
"A Certain Philosophy of Cooking" - See Elísa Viðar's Menu
Elisa Vidarsdottir is a soccer player and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's tasks and usually takes time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
"My typical day starts with me arriving at work at 8 o'clock," says Elisa.
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock.
Elisa finds it very rewarding to pick up her daughter early from preschool.
It's good to have time with her before I go to my second workout.
After exercising, it is good to come home and just have to heat up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we find it nice to watch one episode to clear our minds.
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what she needs to eat to have enough energy to work, go to school, take care of her family, and exercise.
What works for me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorize food as bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
It is okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elisa has a great interest in firefighting.
I find a certain kind of contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking and taking great pleasure in it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a great cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little citrus juice, let soak in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available each time.
Usually it's banana and granola & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee lover.
Snacks: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, cookies, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the box if that's what it comes to.
Lunch: I often make a variety of salads from what's in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, lettuce salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is usually what I'm working with.
If the schedule goes completely off the rails (which happens often), then the egg machine in the office has come to my rescue many times and then it's two slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled egg, don't put any more on you.
Snack: Get me something carb-rich for workouts, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often chosen at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Authorities in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of emergency following large-scale protests in the downtown area.
Yesterday, police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched across several blocks near the city's capitol building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism done to a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosive.
Police and law enforcement authorities say that protesters have pelted police with stones, bottles, firecrackers, and other loose objects, and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were treated.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was intended to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been an ongoing conflict between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people are gathering under the banner of Black Lives Matter, commemorating George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding reform.
Not revoked until after a vote
It is still not clear whether the layoffs of Icelandair employees that are due to take effect in the next month will be reversed.
The online voting on the collective agreement of Icelandair Flight Attendants on behalf of Icelandair Flight Attendants will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the company, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are known.
"This clearly ties together," says Guðlaug Líney.
No layoffs have been reversed, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are anxious to find out if they will have a job after the month ends.
An agreement was chosen to be signed last week, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the pilots had previously voted on.
On July 17th, the board and council of trustees of Icelandair approved a general strike, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, as a result of Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants Union, terminate all of its flight attendants, and seek agreements with another union.
Then, the airline's crew members were to take on the role of security officers on board temporarily.
When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
People are in shock after the Icelandair announcement that all of its flight attendants were laid off and that an agreement would be made with another union.
"Now it becomes clear whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period is misaligned, for those with the shortest employment period it is three months and ends around the July-August month end.
In that group, about 90% are Icelandair passengers.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
We then look forward to continuing our dialogue with our stakeholders.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants feel they have gone too far.
The vote on the collective agreement ends and Icelandair will announce the annual results of the fourth quarter tomorrow.
The flight attendant's vote on the new contract will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, and preliminary results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Online voting on the collective agreement between Icelandair and the Icelandic Confederation of Labour began on Wednesday, July 22nd and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27th at 12 noon.
Those eligible to choose the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Union.
Icelandair and the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association (FFÍ) signed a new collective agreement on the night of Sunday, July 19th, after Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the association earlier that Friday, following the rejection of the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had previously announced to all of its flight attendants and pilots that they would be on duty on Friday, but those plans were reversed after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more per month for the same base salary.
The agreement is valid until the year 2025 and provisions have been agreed upon by pilots and flight attendants regarding how long one shift can last.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and many flight attendants expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement when interviewed by the press.
Most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted in order to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, with the company's EBIT, operating income for financial items and taxes, according to preliminary results, estimated to be negative between 100 and 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent Kauphöllin an invoice last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue had decreased by 60 million dollars, or about 830 million kronur.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $154 million at the end of the quarter, or around 21 billion krona.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer a share of the company's stock in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete agreements with fifteen lenders, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before going into a debt offering.
A new variety rather than a new species of plant.
"New waves" just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
"This is not something that has been seen domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, Chief Physician at the Infectious Diseases Department of Landspítali, about the news that a "new strain of virus" has been identified in the country.
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday and two at the border.
One who tested positive had participated in a social activity at the Rey Cup soccer tournament, and the source of the infection is unknown and the spread of the infection is still ongoing.
Also, one individual who arrived in the country on July 15th tested positive for COVID-19 and two people who were in contact with them have started showing symptoms of the virus.
Yesterday, an infection was identified that is related to the infection reported the day before, and after investigation by the Icelandic Genetics Institute, it was revealed that it is a "new strain of virus that has not been identified here before."
The infection has been contained in relation to that infection.
Mar emphasizes that this is not a new virus, but rather the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variety of the species rather than a new species.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about another wave of migration starting, Már says that as it stands it is a single case and it could be that nothing more comes of it.
"However, if there are cases within the country that are not related to foreign sources and have the same genetic makeup as this particular strain, then it would be possible to make that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is too early to make such a statement," Már explains.
The joy in the hot pot
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot pots?
BBC documentary makers lead to an entertaining video that sheds light on the country's sunbathing and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is said that nowhere else in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
Natural geothermal energy is the basis of this, as well as the tradition of sustainability that prevails here.
Compulsory schooling for children was introduced in 1940, but older citizens are no less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Vacations are described as an integral part of the country's general welfare.
Everyone is equal in the pot, regardless of class and status.
People connect on a personal level through phone calls, home and abroad, or enjoy the power of water-like elements: thoughts and currents of electricity that charge the soul and body.
It's a short time to the elections in 100 days.
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election but he has an uphill battle to fight.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic nominee, has a large lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a new AP news poll, a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
President Trump's response to the global spread of the new coronavirus is similarly very unpopular, and furthermore, more Americans than ever before believe that the president has handled economic matters poorly.
Specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the US is on the right track.
32 percent said they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent said he has done well on economic matters.
In March, the ratio was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden has 49.9 percent support nationwide while Trump has 41.9 percent support.
Trump himself has tried to shift the focus away from his stance on immigration to Biden, emphasize so-called culture wars, and promote policies that are supposed to adhere to laws and regulations.
Biden's campaign is still heavily focused on Trump and has good odds of winning if the election ultimately comes down to how Trump has performed in office over the last four years.
Unpopular Trump also seems to be targeting Republican lawmakers and Democrats fear they could even gain a majority in the House of Representatives, which until now has been highly unlikely.
Politico reported today that party and candidate loyalty is waning and that the Republican Party is now facing its biggest losses in a decade.
The suburbs have proven to be particularly unfavorable to the party in the 2016 elections and now there is a likelihood that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has attempted to intimidate suburban residents into following him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and exacerbate racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has rolled back a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he encouraged "housewives" from the United States to read an article by the former Deputy Secretary of State of New York, in which she argued that Biden would eliminate US housewives and Trump endorsed it.
Biden will empower your communities and the American Dream.
"I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the president.
Residents of the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become President.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 election, his support there has significantly declined.
Although there is variation between polls, Biden has been polling with a lead of about fifteen percentage points over Trump in the elections recently.
Regis Philbin has passed away.
American television personality Regis Philbin has passed away, aged 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, presenter, and singer for over six decades.
He is most well-known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the individual who has been on American television the most hours and has been recognized for this achievement.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
It was announced by his family that Philbin had passed away due to natural causes.
The number of collaborators, friends, and admirers have celebrated him on social media over the past year.
Will the Olympic Flame be lit at the end of the races?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through together.
The crew has an extra year to prepare themselves and the authorities in Japan to incur additional costs due to the delay.
Everyone holds their hat in high esteem.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the joy of the Japanese delegates was uncontainable.
They wept and cheered alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games but had to settle for a lower-key event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan should draw the world's attention.
The games were originally scheduled to take place from July 24th to August 9th, but have been postponed for a year and will now start on July 23rd 2021 and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to hold the game, if the coronavirus threat is still too great, the game will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that thought through to the end.
The Olympic Games are not a regular sporting event.
Nothing is to be spared, the show must always be grand and strive to top the last performance.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the presentations of the cities by the selection committee.
The more impressive the presentation is, the more likely you are to get the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympics, which is roughly equivalent to 20 billion krona.
For the second time, when the 2020 games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion kroner, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was chosen to host the games that year, Japanese authorities had already allocated a budget of 30 billion yen for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, sports venues, and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to host such an event, prepare for it, and hold the games themselves.
Japanese organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway this days but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
According to a report from a government inspector in Japan released at the end of last year, however, it was found that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It is likely not possible to put an exact figure on the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all of Iceland's tax revenues would only cover about half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion among economists, who try to delve into the numbers and examine the benefits and costs of the Games.
In the shortest terms, it appears that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less positive than expected for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are any, for example, a large increase in jobs for a short period of time, but in the long run cities often end up with high debt and high operational costs from underutilized human resources.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is still dealing with significant debts from the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to maintain all the major sports facilities that were built for the games.
An analysis of the figures after the London 2012 Games has revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed beforehand.
That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting Olympic Games due to the significant costs associated with the infrastructure built for the games.
The benefit is still thought to be found in increased tourist traffic wanting to visit the Olympic cities as a result of the games, although there is much uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main point is the honor that towns are granted to be chosen, but it is difficult to measure in terms of money.
Despite the tremendous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of a nature that can be priced.
Even though the show is generously funded and no expense is spared, this is of course not just about money.
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some athletes, it is surprisingly welcome to postpone the games.
Australian pentathlete and gold medalist at the 2016 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is an example of a caseload and would have been far from good form this summer, but looks forward to being in competition shape for the 2021 games.
She is one of those athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who had planned to retire after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will have to retire before the games take place.
Do not rely solely on your body to get through the year with intense workouts.
Few athletes captured the hearts of Olympic viewers in Rio 2016 as much as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has made several appearances in her home country the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to compete in 2021 but she is not necessarily sure she will still be at the top of the game next year, as she will be 24 then.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a female athlete in the front row.
"It's a sensitive subject," Biles says, but she quickly moves on to another topic in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she plans to achieve the same success at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year of extra training," says Biles.
She has previously mentioned that her body cannot handle the strain of gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she is training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles acknowledges that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
No exceptions were made for Bale compared to others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic golds couldn't buy her any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like the rest.
The basic form certainly yields better results than most people.
We have a strict plan in place now.
It was difficult to start exercising again after the gym reopened.
We started slow but are now in full swing again and I will increase the exercises as the year progresses.
We obviously don't know exactly how these games will turn out or if they will be held, but we are still aiming for them to be held, we can't do anything else.
"I have put too much pressure on myself to quit the sport now," says Biles.
Along with her and many others, there is a hope or rather an awareness that the situation may arise where the games will not be held in 2021.
Predicting it is nevertheless impossible.
No one can know what the state of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympics assuming they will be held that year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed the wedding due to the pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are more important things to think about right now," said the actor in an interview with People.
We definitely want to get married someday and have our dream wedding with all our loved ones present.
We decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now, which is to help spread the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm paying more attention to world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what is happening in the world.
