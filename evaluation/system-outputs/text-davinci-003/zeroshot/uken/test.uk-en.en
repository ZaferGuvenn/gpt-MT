Good day, sorry I had no internet and couldn't send it sooner. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address to go to for cleaning tomorrow, the key code, and what time tomorrow the guests will check out and the new guests will check in?
Unfortunately, I must decline your offer as I have already found a job at this time.
Sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes I feel like my thoughts in Czech translated through a translator are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
Please let me know, is there an earlier time?
Since I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, then I'm still okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
In Kharkiv, people have again taken to the streets in a protest, and the Russians were unable to disperse them.
Participants of the event told the agency that the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military forces of the Russian Federation arrived with their equipment to disperse them.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the RF technicians have arrived," said one of the event participants.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protest rallies at Freedom Square - near the ODAs and regional councils.
Currently, this square, as well as the building, is being controlled by armed Russian forces who are using weapons against protesters and abducting people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian forces are using force and weapons against people who are injured and detained.
Also, Russian bandits are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has bestowed the special title of "City-Hero" upon Kherson.
On February 24th, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting mass shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns using artillery, rocket launchers, and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my father here.
He died the next day after my birthday.
Overall, the dreams are good.
Hello, have a good day.
I did as you said and the phone started charging!
Great news!
Thank you!
We can meet in a year or two and then I will go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.

Oleg also found me a side job - cleaning two apartments that are rented out to tourists on a daily basis.
Apartments in the center of Prague are located.
Would it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday, or another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could do as you wrote at 5:00 pm today.
That is why I read the Bible, the Quran, and other things to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the accommodation that needs to be cleaned?
I mean, have good dreams?

May God grant that we arrive safely.
When you come, call me on the phone. The doorbell doesn't work.
It would be better if it were cheaper...we are forced to move because we can't afford European prices.
I need to look around and try to figure out where it hurts.
He wants to press on all my sore spots right now, he knows where they are.
It doesn't have any effect on me at all anymore.
I didn't want to talk about him and his drama yesterday with Mitch.
You can't put it in a bank, it won't work with the rain. When it's not raining, I'll close it again.
I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.
This is my Ukrainian classmate.
Alexander is running from one corner to another here, there is so much that her eyes are spinning and she wants to be everywhere at once.

Your coffee has already arrived, I can bring it tomorrow.
You can leave your shopping in the car and then we can pick up the kids and get the things.
I already wrote to you twice :)) but I'm making a double round on the trains.
I didn't understand, will Valya and I be together at two o'clock?
Did you mean that we clean up by ourselves and you just supervise?
Can we switch shifts with Valya? Valya in the morning and me in the afternoon?
Mom will live in a dormitory here because the rent is cheap for a dormitory.
The main thing is that I have somewhere to live.
Sasha was not in school today, so I emailed the teacher.
Hiüëãüèª I'm not feeling well, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, as long as I have a recipe, but I prefer to bake.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have a favorite dish, I love to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy doing something.
The train is more precise, but there are no seats.
Sorry, but we are a little late.
Lucy, can I help in the kitchen too?
It's great that Julia will have the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment yesterday evening.
It is very cozy and comfortable there.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there is a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can take any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting, we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine, and specifically for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian forces suffer defeats there, the Russians may abandon the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It beats - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city defenders - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol is, the stronger our position will be in the eastern part of the state, in the Donbas region, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not make it to the meeting.
Because then Russia will be taking all the steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we are currently de-occupying.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and maybe even not interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory...
English: President Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the detention of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are present".
Straight talk: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms would satisfy them.
If we speak non-emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
Even where there are millions of victims, all wars come to an end.
So, we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for nothing when there is nothing and no one.
Good day, do you have any more available spots for the Czech course for adults at 7:00 pm on Tuesday?
You can meet your family at Kutnia Gora according to your wish.
And here are these two, these are my cousins.
Okay, got it.
I'm not sure I'll be able to clean up by 1:00 pm because it's a big apartment and there's a lot to clean.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I can't promise.
I will let you know when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominic, who is responsible for purchasing consumable materials?
Is this a recurring procedure or do I need to order as needed?
In connection with the change of the esthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature and the study of its state.
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for an analysis of postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

I am currently living in Prague 9. I am ready to move anywhere if there is a job. I would be very grateful for any advice or offers).
If you don't want to talk to me, then I will understand.
Why did you believe that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for a purpose.
Mostly, for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I will give you this money if the bank approves it.
You have 30,000 UAH in debt, plus 30,000 UAH to leave you with.
Janka, I hope you are doing well and your grandmother won't call me bad names.

For the cafeteria, a code is needed.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has released a list of Russian military personnel who participated in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha in Kyiv Oblast.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is reporting this on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade, who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Buha, - the statement reads.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine states that all military criminals responsible for crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine will be brought to justice and held accountable.
View the list at the link.
According to Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian occupiers.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian military forces have been documented in liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced that 280 people had been buried in the brotherly graves.
General Prosecutor Irina Venediktova announced that on March 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv Oblast liberated from Russian occupiers.
On February 24th, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting mass shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.
Good day, I apologize, but I won't be able to work for you because I will be flying to Canada soon.
Immediately after the dash are formal names, to the side are slang expressions, in parentheses are abbreviations used on a timetable.
I don't want to bother you, take a rest.
I was watching the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brands.
Just nice clothing at reasonable prices and in various sizes.
We were at the store at the train station.
What professions are being offered that don't require language knowledge?
It is important if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare.
I thought it would be a week, but the situation is getting worse, the sirens are constant.
Tomorrow there may be poor connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have taken away experience from each situation for myself so that I don't repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written amendments which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be a problem with this.
In Ukraine many people are celebrating this week as well.
It depends on the religion.
Is the person Greek Catholic or Catholic?
At first, you can try it for free.
Can you write us a payment algorithm, we will pay for it ourselves.
We have the paper that children receive at the end of the school year, which is the report card, and the certificate they receive at birth and marriage.
Yes! He is on it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
They say that you need to fill out a census in Czech.
I will try to make it in time. I still have to go to the town hall to sign the documents.
Don't be mad at your spouse for being on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Blessed Virgin Mary for you.
May they envelop you with the embrace of love and warmth of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Would you mind if I come right after the war?
The location, date, and time will be determined according to interests and availability.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Wow, I have money for two months of rent, the area in Olomouc doesn't matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the animal attacks on the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of massacred and slaughtered people shocked the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people drinking from each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
Nothing from me was surprising at all. Exactly what I was dreading and expecting is happening.
I took the children and their summer parents out of Kyiv the next day of the war.
Then the female colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have been consistently helping the Ukrainian army and never doubted that in the event of the occupation of Kyiv my family would not be spared.
I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU gave permission to copy the case file of the grandfather: the entire case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence for the crime was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was silent, denying guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from the free people, a poor "one-village" gentry, never went to taverns.
The fact that they lived on a farm and had a few cows was enough to conscript the peasant and the minor children into the army.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and all were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the carnival case there is the surname of the drummer Sharie.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and am not surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple does not fall far from the tree, as they say.
The firing squad that was sent to execute the peasants were ethnic Russians.
After analyzing my grandfather's case, I became interested in various information resources.
In Russia there are (seriously) great informational resources like "Bessmertnyi Barak" which provide quality reminders of the events of those years.
In modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and eliminate almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers were initially discredited and then destroyed by the system.
They found child pornography files on the computer, so they put the person in jail, and they died quickly there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to uncover the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There is concentrated the most repulsive aspects of human nature.
Over the thousand-year-old Mongol tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
Then they conducted a beastly genetic experiment on what had come out, cutting out the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Did you see my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I was wondering if you know where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lubosh, Igor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow (he has a day off and can go since they haven't looked at the car at the station yet).
We are very sorry to trouble you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
In Borodyantsi near Kyiv, during the clearance of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
The defenders of Mariupol reported an unknown toxic substance being dispersed over the city from a Russian drone.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
In the fighting in eastern Ukraine yesterday, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of motor vehicles, one helicopter, and three unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed.
Today your coffee will already arrive!)
I got my first "bicycle" after my brother.
When the girls come back from school, what do they do afterwards?
We arrived at the place where we were housed from the center in Pardubice, the conditions were good.
There is a big house here where men drink alcohol and smoke indoors, loud music is the least that "disturbed" us, the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and us with children... it's scary to go to sleep honestly.
Please help with housing, please for money.
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's almost like they are smoking in here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, he is screaming, something doesn't please him. It's very scary.
I'm just praying if you can help.
The main thing we understood about each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, such pleasant caregivers.
You are doing so much for us, it's incredible, thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stefanie, Agata wants to join the game, she has been missing the game üòâ
We need to get to that hatch.
For now, we are not ready to pay such money, we will wait for help and then plan something.
How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
I will be at the main entrance, do you want me to let you know and you will open?
I wanted to see if I could find a cake for Karen if I had time.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We were talking about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how did we find the dog, how did we find the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked me to convey their greetings to you and to say that they are very interested in keeping up with the news.
We will be talking about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
We agreed that if a child comes and their parents don't understand Czech at all, then I can help them over the phone after work.
I need to change my bed linen, 2 sets.
It suits me just fine on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to major holidays ceremonies.
Thank youüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èI will write down my work data today.
I really enjoyed the data, thank you for organizing it.
In Nestor there is only a cold so far, but in Galynka the temperature is 37.7 in the evening and 38.
The line for General Chapka is moving very slowly.
Everyone has a chance.
The most important thing is for love to be genuine and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for practical and mercantile purposes.
I have a problem with this, if I don't love someone nothing will come of it.
So, we picked up Grandma and took her home right away.
She was very very thankful, she was even crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it's possible there might be an old quilt and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it will. I'm also very grateful to you.
I felt sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had many questions for God as to why situations were occurring in my life that were making me lose faith in everything.
Do the small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other groceries.
I just decided to go and you made the arrangements.
We don't know our way around here and don't know where everything is. We were looking for a supermarket for an hour and had to walk back. Two small cars are not suitable, so two large ones are needed.
Even now, I was thinking of you and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only speak Russian or does anyone else in your family?
Can the children come to Vali's and play in the living room?
Okay, let's take a risk then :)
I'm also glad to have met you.
I was talking to Volodymyr about whether to wait for them to find a place for me or to look for one myself. They also told me that there are people living with us here who can help us go to the metro museum station, where there is an agency that helps find housing.
Because I'm small, I'll step over the barrier. üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
It would be great if possible on Thursday.
I can't call the doctor yet because I haven't done the food license inspection yet.
But I can't call him because I'm out of money on my account.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and it won't top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Waterfone app, I can't change my plan to get normal calls and internet, nor can I top up my number.
I'm already losing my mind.
Where price is not a factor, but rather the face... What did you mean by the title?
I feel embarrassed to sit idle.
I just wrote that in school for the lesson.
Sorry for bothering you, I was just really stressed out.
They are getting closer to leaving the borders of Ukraine to be sure they will arrive.
Right now, life is in question for everyone.
Okay. The size is for 10-11 years old. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I am looking for everything for the home and for the child.
Thank the people who accepted me, I live in a hut and they always ask if I need something but I'm embarrassed to say I'm trying to find it myself.
I just got home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain anything, act as if I'm not here.
It is impossible to answer without a sent resume.
I can't tell Mom that :)
I really don't feel myself right now, that I couldn't keep my emotions in check before we left the apartment... As tonight...
May God grant Yura success üôè and then I will immediately lie down and sleep a little.
I will write to you at any time.
Hi. Susan, can you help me? I just got my payment for March. Is this for both me and Yuliya or just me? I can't figure out why the amount is like this.
Sure, you can make copies of the passports when it's convenient for you :)
In our village we have one of the best high schools in the region.
I'm already having fun talking to you, and I even like it üòâ
I went to the shelter and they offered me temporary housing for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why is there less and less of it?
The flowers have bloomed. Everything is okay. Everyone is rested and very nice.
According to "European Truth", this is reported by Welt with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 helicopters, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Boxer armoured vehicles are also offered in a variant for 1.2 billion euros.
At the same time as tanks in battle have to get relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of over 30 kilometers.
Ukrainian government officials have reported that the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be provided according to a circular scheme, citing KMW's proposal.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the trenches that have been formed will then be filled with industry at the next stage.
The first new helicopters can be delivered within 30 months after the contract is signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is this for the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will figure out how to replenish the account and make a deposit. I will get back to you. Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without going through the commission, but when my doctor prescribes it, I will go through the commission correctly, did I understand correctly?
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns right now?
Hello, I apologize. Do you need any workers?
You can mop the floor or do the dishes.
I'm from Ukraine unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I am learning every day, so I think I will learn everything I need to work without any problems.
I think I've kept you talking long enough, it's probably time for you to get some sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I will take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are smart and everything will be alrightüôè Rest, recharge and sleep tight!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
On her birthday, the cat tries to end her life by suicide on Charles Bridge.
Did you manage to negotiate with someone?
We wanted to solve the problem with the Easter card. We don't have internet banking and we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Who do we turn to for the place we live in?
Always say goodbye when you leave.
Yes, we can after 5 pm.
Can I send the whitewash tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hi. Yes, I will be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long have you been studying this specialty?
If it were warm, that would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I'll try to go after work today.
We are doing well. We are managing with the wood-burning stove, we have experience with it in Ukraine, there is gas but since it is very expensive, we are burning wood in the stove.
Good day, Lena, could you please tell me where the nearest stationery store is?
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
Everything worked out in the end.
I need to take Karinka with me.
I set a white rat trap, came home and translated what was written on the table near the laundry room door, repair the channel, can the trap be set or should it be turned off.
It says my status will change in 24 hours. But why? What is this a comedy? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The ex-man can't settle down, he keeps writing me poems (a real drama).
I want everything that officially binds us to him to end as soon as possible.
Thank you for not making things too difficult for us here.
We already have a product with features.
Sorry, I think I got something wrong.
I didn't understand Czech so well then.
I must have made something up to myself.
It is true that they go to school like this in threes because Galya and Svyatoslav are studying remotely and will receive their diplomas upon completion of Ukrainian school in the fall. They need to apply to universities.
How do I get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a secret between two people that they don't share with their family or friends.
The man and woman decide matters in their family on their own, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are ready.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to leave?
Yes, I'm happy to listen to jazz.
Thank you, I'm working with this application, we talked about it in Czech class on Wednesday.
For the last four years, I have not let anyone in, read many books on philosophy, and figured out myself.
When it hurts too much, it's hard to trust.
But we must try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that is life.
Martin, we are already going to bed.
Thank you for such a wonderful and fun day.
We all really enjoyed it.
We feel like we are at home.
The children all evening told their father, all the grandmothers and grandfathers how much fun they had with them.
Greetings from the girls! Best wishes from us for the holidaysüòâ
And where have we been now?
I hope my son will come out of this meat grinder alive.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How can I contact them to get them to open the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus?
I am very grateful for those who help people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are currently at Slapi, and our friends have welcomed us for the time being.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist and a rehabilitologist looking for a job.
In order for our children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just needed to get out of town today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know even big stores would be closed.
Cook the stuffed cabbage like this: in a pot, mix 0.5 liters of water with 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste and bring to a boil.
I put the stuffed cabbage rolls in a pot and pour the sauce over them.
Bake in the oven for approximately 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this account?
I need to bring all of this.
From Monday 4.
In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Employment Office at the Przemysl Market.
The branch in Hall 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance, so there is a translator on site.
Lydia has already been accepted to the school but due to illness we will meet the teacher on Tuesday. I informed her today.
I'm sitting here, wearing headphones, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
I stand by this that we are together. We are a pair.
I would say that there will be a lot of work after the war.
I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
I'm not afraid that I will fall into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with the housing.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to get a food license inspection. Can I do that here?
Please let me know if I need to prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Do I understand correctly that there are five places in the room with the television?
Arrange and cover the sofa.
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
It's not new, it has been used before, but it is working but not needed.
Write the address in Czech and let's look at a map to see where it is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with the furniture yet. I finally want to see that apartment this week and then I'll understand what furniture I need.
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, it's hard to adjust.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have the chance to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning and tell you how much I love you.
For the baby there is already a crib and a bathtub here, things have been found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me whenever you can, but don't forget to give back too.
I want to get a haircut called a cap.
Oleg is sick - fever and cough. It's better for Yana not to come to us so she doesn't get infected.
Only I will be a bit later - around 8 o'clock. Is that okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
I'm hoping everything will be okay!?
We didn't even talk about this with these excursions!
I understand how important this is for you!
As for myself, I'm silent (for me it's just an unreachable peak)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
Sorry for troubling you.
I was confused that we started translating the test badly with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask Grigory Denisenko or Yoneshka if they can help me a little bit with mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any help to them?
If given the opportunity, I would like to brush up on my math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make sure it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are also hoping for this.
She was very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect to the internet with my Czech phone number.
Yesterday at bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay on the sidelines.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
Yesterday evening I thanked God for this girl, for she is the first person from Ukraine that my heart felt mutual love for.
The branch in Hall 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it, I'm just a person.
She didn't want anyone to know she was waiting.
I didn't go. So, I figured it out myself. I can do it! Most importantly, you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
One year ago at the Babyn Yar Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility connected to our history.
If the evil demons of the past appear today in a new guise, he said, then for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of innocent civilians, starving the inhabitants of the cities it has blockaded, and allowing them to die from disease.
Russian forces are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, which visually resembles the Babyn Yar massacre.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons, which until recently was unimaginable.
Germany is withdrawing the delivery of heavy weaponry necessary for Ukraine.
"Never Again!" means more than just standing up against fascism.
This means to fight against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and cruelty in all possible ways.
There is no easy path without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities occurring in Ukraine.
I sing you a song tonight
We agree, let's make arrangements for the tour and write down when to meet.
Everyone was sick except for Lydia; they had a new strain of coronavirus.
Then I will do it tomorrow.
I am using this voucher instead of a card.
Apologize for the delay in submitting the documents.
The conductor charged me 2000 hryvnias for the ticket.
Serhiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has stopped being a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the start of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to decline while the number of supporters began to increase.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO membership and the assistance NATO provides in times of war, there is now much criticism of the Alliance and its member countries for their delayed supply of weapons, refusal to close the skies, and unwillingness to "confront" Russia.
Besides this, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its pursuit of membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position, if this can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the latest episode of the podcast "Tough Questions", we talk with the editor of "European Truth" about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for free, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history, and why security guarantees being discussed in negotiations with Russia could become another Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here?
I have a volt partner assigned to review my application.
I was submitting her through this mobile app.
There are no visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, there they did not give visas, but gave a permit.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
I agreed to meet the Ukrainian boy I met yesterday near the school so he could show me everything.
So I hope everything is alright with him.
I don't like it so much, it doesn't last long enough for me.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I am leaving the children alone and waiting there for 3-4 years and then going home because I can't leave them any longer.
Take your brother with you for 6-7 years.
So, there was a sick heart.
I had genuine feelings for this person, but he acted inappropriately and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I rejected him.
After some time he called to say that he had undergone heart surgery.
Asking him just to chat with me made him feel sorry.
I have been psychologically supporting him for almost a year.
For this hour we have talked a lot.
Then I started having problems at work simultaneously.
His support also helped me at that time.
Mutual help.
I thought to myself, maybe I really need to look at him differently.
He proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
God Himself decided our fate.
What does "ready for marriage" mean to you?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ Now I have a place to stay and a place to be with my child.
Should I have been reminded earlier?
Yes, I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that a translator doesn't always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, does she have to give paper?
It looks like the guests have forgotten it, I put it in the closet.
You should probably go to bed now so you can work tomorrow.
Can someone help, need items for a woman size XS or S with a height of 165. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
At the store, I bought two packs and my mom bought two.
It's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my spirits.
Alright, let's talk about something else, I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm getting more and more tired and I'm having nightmares about being bombed...
God never hurries, everything has its own time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the value of unskilled work and realize that the kind of job I had at home in Kyiv I won't be able to have here and the money I was making at home I won't be receiving here now either.
I can't just sit and do nothing because then all sorts of bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to keep myself busy with some kind of physical activity.
At the airport, documents are processed from 7am to 7pm, otherwise you can just wait.
Vladimir turned around at 4 o'clock.
We took them with us.
We arrived with Vika in the kitchen, they put them in the bedroom.
I will finish my work and go to the Airport with them.
When he is with you, write and find out what's next...
I can't find a place for myself.
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering high school.
Okay, but I'm doing this difficultly.
Okay, let me know when it's convenient for you. üòò
I don't know about work yet. It would be nice if I could arrange for the children to go to kindergarten and school.
We had planned this. Would it be better if we changed things up sometimes?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from the middle. Sorry, shall we agree on another deadline?
I offer a job of cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, and dusting.
The job is for approximately 3-4 hours. The one-time payment is 800 hryvnias. Starting from Tuesday, April 19th at 2:00 PM.
I hope I can tell you that everything is going well for us.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your spouse's contact information?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
We consider Ganna to be the original form of the name Anya.
Her uncle gave her something from home.
We made an English version and added new partners.
Write to him if anything is needed.
Please don't forget about me.
Are Monday and Wednesday classes different?
Thank you very much. You are doing so much for our family! We are all immensely grateful to you.
To be in the pool you need a permit.
But that's my opinion.
She got roller skates and a skateboard from my uncle at home, so she skated on them at home, so that's what she has.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and I'm only now preparing breakfast.
I am very embarrassed that you are talking to me on your day off. I hope I am not too much of a bother.
We would like to inform you about a change of residence and also submit documents for the renewal of the card.
We are now providing medical oxygen to all the doctors in our country.
I almost forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mom said she was baking donuts for the children.
He is coming to visit you.
Could you please tell me if you have an approximate cleaning schedule for the upcoming month, even just for a rough understanding of which days?
I can't seem to remember this schedule )
The Russian army is threatening to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "we have never done this before".
Konashenkov's direct words: "We see attempts of diversions and strikes by Ukrainian forces on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will launch strikes against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained.
Russians have been launching rocket strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remaining Russian missiles, shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26th, a Russian rocket struck a multi-story building on Valeriy Lobanovskiy Prospect.
On March 1, Russians drove into a crowd of pedestrians near Babyn Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passersby.
On March 2nd, Ukrainian PPO systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the buildings of the Ministry of Defense near the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupier's rocket shattered a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18th, a Russian rocket struck a residential area in Vinogradar, resulting in one death and 19 injured people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles struck the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klychko announced on April 13 that residents of the capital who had evacuated the city should not return yet.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and that there were also a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance around the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on Russian territory in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1st near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, apparently as a result of an aerial attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian projectile" had supposedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that elites in both Washington and Berlin are chilled to the bone at the thought that NATO fighters will be shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them, but rather with their voters and society as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky will not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he will convince the European people who elect those politicians.
And these words, this refined blend of strength, gracefulness and sometimes rage, gradually reach their goal.
While Biden is still firmly against closing the skies, 70% of his constituents already support the idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be considered as cheaters.
The money you collect should be given to those in greater need.
I can come to you and we can decide when I'm there. I would like to help anyway.
The air is clean, that's a plus!
It says here that I have the "Two Together without Internet" tariff, but I asked to make it with internet instead.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have another room today or just the stairs up and down as usual?
I'm already on my way by train, what about you?
But I will never stop loving you, you mean everything to me.
This loan is taken out by a financial consultant.
It will take a few days for this.
Katya asked for the internet, can she be given a password?
I thought you two didn't get along with each other from Milan.
Then my husband will drive me because today he has a car from the construction company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to cut it into four parts.
One of these pieces can be used for 2-3 days, but it should be changed every year.
I am interested in architecture and culture.
I'm very glad that everything is okay with you.
Most likely, the concert will start at 6:20 PM and I will be free again afterwards.
Now I want to eat something sweet.
I will make tea and have some candy.
I went to the school's website and now I'm trying to order Annie's lunch for tomorrow.
Let's go for a walk on the weekends I love so much.
Can we come by tomorrow to find out the terms?
My name is Sasha and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for both children and adults.
I am speaking Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech intensively and learning.
It would be nice to have an email so that the Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS won't work here since they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't be able to understand each other.
Do you really not want this price?
He helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to offer.
If you don't need a price list, I won't provide it.
Tell yourself how you want it and I will make it happen.
You didn't want to write to me today for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I only ask for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is everything alright with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
Are you planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday in the mall?
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot process this.
He is clinging to the old reality.
Are you calling work to find out if you have to go in to work today or not?
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last forever.
Now we are making an agreement that something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where should I go? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent it all at home.
Many of our supervisors have not given us our wages for our work.
Where should I go? Who do I need? How do I provide for my children? Where do I live?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take anything practical from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to night, you take the children around Prague.
What's next? Unknown. How much is that? Unknown. The children are asking for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
We don't have one of those from each iron.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with the hearts and words the children gave her when she came to school.
You needed to call me when you arrived.
I will write to you in the evening.
English: So, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I no longer have the strength for all this.
I thought you had fallen in love with a Ukrainian girl and had no time for chatting üòá
I figured out the menu and even already ordered.
Would you be interested in participating in activities with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what type and kind specifically?
Please send a page with your visa or entry stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libush, did you pay for these services?
I can't understand.
You are doing so much good for us....
We are before you in great debt... thank you!
Okay, I understand that this is very good.
Now I will send you a photo of the business card of the woman I am learning English from.
What will you decide tomorrow, should we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so nice to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't you want to meet up after 4:00 PM?
What are your overall impressions of the first week?
Carina brought us the medicine yesterday and we are taking it.
I can work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
I must specify that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I offer you a favor in return?
There is only antibacterial gel there.
I can't say for sure, because I'm not very familiar with the city...around half past twelve.
What services/activities, in your opinion, are needed/missing for elderly people?
I don't know yet because I haven't received a text from the bank and I haven't taken out a bank card yet and my kids deleted the banking app, which really annoyed me.
Then please write to me when you will be traveling.
Today we are joyful - our city of Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops have arrived.
The enemy is conducting a sweep - they are searching for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the demolition work will begin.
Ivan would have looked to see if something needed to be repaired or something else needed to be done.
Diana, do what you want. Maybe he will be embarrassed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, he says he gets tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake a pie and do lessons.
These are small businesses that have opened volunteer hubs in their premises and shops.
These are the tractor drivers who are actually under fire as they go out to the field to sow the seeds.
These are bus drivers who have agreed to travel to temporarily occupied territories in convoys today to deliver aid and pick up people.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go into the combat zone, calming and helping refugees in the trains, and at peaceful stations they help volunteers load humanitarian aid into the cars.
These were the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served the exhausted and nervous people.
These are the municipal workers who are under fire, collecting garbage, repairing water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are the doctors and nurses who work 24 hours a day to save people without complaint, and in their free time they volunteer, collecting medical supplies to the frontlines.
In Ukraine, the tears stop when the little leaves come.
Please tell me, what age of children do you mean?
Is 8 years old an acceptable age for my daughter?
I am looking for accommodation for my girlfriend and me for 3-4 days while we travel to the Czech Republic to submit our passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw there are a lot of people at the visa center and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a long time to get there by train, it will be hard for the child.
Tom decided to look for accommodation in Prague or close to it.
No, everything is arranged for us.
Where were the appliances put yesterday?
But I can't change my password when I follow the link, because I get this error:
This was in the microwave, something was burning in there.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always available 24 hours a day to communicate with customers and quickly resolve any questions :)
Nothing, we'll get used to the new realities.
It is very unpleasant for me and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. Most importantly, it should be truthful.
The TV is full of this.
We have already agreed on the refrigerators, some Czech guys will come at 13:00 and help to move them.
I want to come to you. To hug you tightly. And to kiss you.üòò
At 7:30 I am reading a history of world theater to actors, directors, and theater scholars.
In the evening I evaluate projects. After dinner I
Grishko will sleep, he was crying a lot at night, and he is teething.
I am currently on the phone with all my acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
Czechia started issuing visas again after March 22, I believe.
Until that time - they had stamped such and then compared these stamps to visas.
The Ukrainian Foreign Electoral District (FED Ukraine) is an electoral district that combines voting precincts located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling stations in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and premises on foreign military bases, [Footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are stationed. [1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign Election District, only nationwide elections are held: Presidential and Parliamentary elections and nationwide referendums.
Local elections in the USSR are not held.
They are at the station near the mother and child's room.
They say they no longer understand where to go.
Are you angry at me?
I'm going to take a picture in a swimsuit.
I don't need money anymore, I borrowed it from a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I have already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device for this, I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an eSIM card which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm very uncomfortable, I have to work on Sunday and I can't anymore.
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You really need it too.
We don't have enough blankets, down blankets, and plates. The children don't have pajamas and nothing to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...can you please send me the address again, I seem to have lost the text message.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I will somehow manage this within myself.
That would be great, but I know there were no free spots, and basically they are now following the schedule and teaching quite well.
Do you have a meat grinder to make mince? We have one, but it doesn't work.
Goodbye after Easter.
Yesterday, did your mom say something was wrong with you?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and not all of them understand what they are saying. But yesterday she came back with a great mood after that fair.
Today I also went to school.
Today I saw Christina's mom, but she didn't even say hello.
Those apples look delicious, what kind are they?
Andrei Yermak, the head of the President's Office, announced that Russia is beginning a "fake operation" regarding the weapons being transferred to us by our allies.
Ermak's direct words: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness, and strive to "beat" the arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest hoaxes is the alleged destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia by Russia.
Prime Minister Edward Heger has already clarified this information.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can spread false rumors that Ukrainian soldiers are defecting with weapons from allies, and that they are massively switching to Russian army armaments.
I want to immediately warn about such fakes.
The weapons in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the garden would cost per month and will it be working in the summer?
Everyone is given their due strength.
There are many sad stories, believe it.
These events had to be experienced by me in order to change.
It is written in Torah, and God created in man an evil inclination so that throughout life's journey she would change spiritually and become better.
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want)
How to find this lady on social media, tomorrow before going to the hospital we will visit the town hall.

I know it was hard for you.
I will do everything to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I am happy.
I hope you meant that seriously. üíû
I see that many of the announcements are already taken. Now it's hard to get our share.
Sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Did you not manage to call today about changing your mobile operator's tariff?
Sorry but I can't rely on anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job on a daily basis.
Sorry, but I already agreed to work there.
Thank you for responding and I wish you luck in finding a good helperüòä
Maybe your dad told you that there are witnesses of Jehovah among us, but I don't practice any religion.
She was baptized in an Orthodox church.
I respect all religions that are based on love.
I was reading the Bible, the Quran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no intermediaries between humans and God.
We can think about not putting the refrigerator near the doors in the boys' room.
I thank you very much, you have been very helpful to me.
We are looking for a housekeeper for regular housekeeping here in the village.
The offer is 150 crowns/year. There is also potential for further collaboration with them. Agree on a date with the lady.
I got a puff of ammonia in my eye. I'm afraid of chemical burns. Can I see a doctor?
I'm just wondering how we will communicate with each other.
We can just look at each other and joke around.
I was going alone to my mother's, and then my sister and her friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked to go with them.
Where is your good barber shop?
Good day, Victor approved this house but doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to receive payment from the government and said that there is currently no furniture available at the bank.
Thank you very much for your hospitality in your home.
We also have good doctors here. Come visit.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, while Moscow has dismissed these reports as "provocation".
Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern declared to journalists in Wellington on April 4th that "Reports of Russian forces killing, abducting, and severely injuring Ukrainian civilians deserve condemnation".
She added that Russia must answer to the world for what they have done, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the incidents "violations of international law".
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of innocent civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left in the streets of Kyiv's suburbs, Buchi, by Russian troops who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos of seemingly dead civilians with their hands bound shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are indications that Russian forces have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
Macron said that "what happened in Belarus requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, has stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Ukraine.
"We will do everything we can to ensure that those responsible for these war crimes do not go unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Minister Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as "provocation".
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts in the one who "ordered" this story," said Zakharova.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the image of Buchi was "yet another setup of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to convene on April 4th to discuss what it has called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bakhchisarai.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4th released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian forces in Buha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian forces of committing a "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buha to see what their military had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out, said Zelensky in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
We have a shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
He said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, "I don't understand when we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded."
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Radio Liberty service saw on the streets of a small town on April 2 what appeared to be civilian bodies.
The correspondent only saw up to 10 bodies on the street in one place.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bujumbura.
The bodies of a group of nine people, all in civilian clothing, were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were shot at close range.
The Ukrainian government has overall stated that at least 410 civilian bodies have been found in the area of Kyiv, which was previously controlled by Russian forces last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kyiv is gone". As the occupiers forced Ukrainians to be deported to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible words: looting, pillaging, murders, and torture.
There is one more item on this list that currently has much less information about it - the relocation of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Approximately in the middle of March, Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has effectively handed over to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Truth" tracked down Ukrainian evacuees and their relatives to investigate how the evacuation is taking place and if there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text arrived at a voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and without a way out.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their families.
Nevertheless, according to statements from the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly removed to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol, Russians have stolen the staff of another orphanage, taken away the children without their parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Valia moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The nation settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like true pioneers, Denis and Marina had already gathered their anxious bundles, but they didn't manage to evacuate by the morning of the 24th of February.
They didn't have their own car, and the local buses were already not taking anyone.
At approximately 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
Approximately 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 o'clock in the evening of February 24th, people entered the lobby who were speaking neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say, "Yes, there is." - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, and if there was any weaponry.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
Women were told: "We have come to protect you by the order of Ramzan Kadyrov."
This was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasha White (commanded a battalion of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we are lacking.
We say that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the merchandise under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway", and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos online of children thanking Kadirov for the food.
They brought sausages after robbing the store and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one particularly wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said, "You have 7 days to give us our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They will constantly separate themselves from Russians.
They said how good it was that they had come, because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good people: "Putin is a monster, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
Mostly they did not fight, but they would ride to rob stores and pillage.
They brought a chicken for themselves, tied a piece of Georgievsky ribbon to one of its legs, and a white piece of tape to the other, and called it "opolchenka".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten at Buchi, so that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Furthermore, we had segregated enclosures - the Chechens did not know each other, and on the first days they asked passwords to identify whether someone was their own or not.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk desant.
They set up 30-40 units of equipment between the buildings - we were constantly getting into it from "Bayraktars".
They came and told us that ZSU no longer exists, but there is "Azov" and, according to them, there are a thousand "Azovs" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv Has Already Surrendered" has been circulating since the beginning of March.
A Russian man came to us - either an officer of the desant or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - they were talking about Buzha, Gostomel, and we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" too.
From the beginning, we sent our lists to the Chechens and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
They are telling us: "You will be deported to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov".
We are saying that we don't want to go either way.
They answered: "Take care of the mental health of your children!"
How it worked: they took us to the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" rockets or with mortars.
Then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, part of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct entrance on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them didn't go, saying that it was for the traitors of the motherland - saying, "they will shoot you there, and sell your organs".
We were driven through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were ruins, broken down machinery, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the machinery away immediately.
There are a lot of tanks, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border crossing "Komar" we went through an improvised check, many people were without documents at all because they had burned.
We were put in Red Cross tents and given tea.
Here we hear shots! A rocket is firing, and we can see a trail - it was the "Iscander" over Kyiv.
The Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, those are planes flying, circling at the border."
We have aviation, we have education, we understand what this is.
Next, we were loaded into a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here I am, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't stop until they crush your thieves.
The poor people are suffering!
We have such a great Lukashenko!
He will do as he says.
They offered to schedule an interview with Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and UN representatives (at least that's what they were called) spread disinformation that men in Poland could not travel.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
We still decided to go, even though we had a problem with the documents - my daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get him on Monday, but war broke out on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, they didn't help us at all, and at the Minsk train station they said that nobody would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were greatly helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and were accompanied.
They couldn't keep up with the pace at the sanatorium.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to two weeks, because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
While driving near Mozyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully glowing, and then fades away.
People who were on the bus in Mozyr reported that Russians were constantly shooting from the firing range there.
I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if they called her son.
In the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, people generally do not believe.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They don't understand that their polygons are being used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, we were waiting for friends who would take us to Estonia.
We are currently going through registration and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia there are now probably as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian flags.
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her grandchildren and asked them to gather the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighbor's house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as our guest!
Thank you for the agreement, lovely motiles.
In this small apartment, there is no Wi-Fi, so I usually answer all your questions, but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
So I will be living with two Ukrainian women and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
The Quran states: "Even a leaf falls from its tree with His knowledge."
The children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner. Mar'yana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and can work from home, while the other Mar'yana has no speciality, so she is a jack of all trades.
Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news - Ukrainian troops on March 31 liberated the city from Russian occupiers.
The next day the occupiers were expelled from all of Kyiv region.
Despite the joy that Ukrainians would have felt in this moment, it was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was revealed at the same time that in only one town, Bucha, Russians had shot at least 280 innocent civilians.
They were killed in the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back, some of the victims were minors.
The bodies of the village head of Motyzhyn, Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor, and their son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found with signs of torture.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in a brother's grave, Igor's was in the sewer.
On the railway tracks 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were discovered.
Russians tried to burn them.
If I go, there will be nobody at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday they were supposed to deliver it to me, but nobody contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it said that the recipient could not be found.
They sent the package to the post office and indicated the address of this branch.
How can I take her away?
When I was little, I could go to the river several times a day, since the river was very close to my house. Now I rarely go there, I don't have the time or the desire, except when I go with my sister.
Please tell me, is this accommodation that you sent someone renting it or what?
I was asked to go to an exhibition with my friend's acquaintances to help them get visas for protection.
I had been almost all day. I was a bit tired of people.
This is a nice house and we can make it very nice ourselves.
Is there any availability in the circle?
Russia will declare a default on its external debt - CNN reports, citing Standard & Poor's agency.
Good evening! I will leave at 8:00 PM, is that convenient for you?
They have a well-organized remote learning system at their school, from 7 to 12 every day, so he can learn from home.
Only half fits, yet I still can't fit one more drying rack.
I can pay 12000 per month, preferably with bonuses.
I hope there won't be any problems. Thank you.
Can I ask for help with paying for my daughter's school lunches?
Do you want me to write it here or bring it tomorrow written on a piece of paper?
This fairy tale is spot on.
You see, there's something we have in common, we both love experimenting with food üòä
Well, I would like to have a job and a store too.
Good day, I have just been offered a position as a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your consideration and apologize.
She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
She forgot to stop by her place, forgot her phone or isn't taking it right now and hasn't written to me that she's at school and that everything is okay :)
I'm worried about her because she is not at home, but in another, not yet fully familiar country.
I hope I have found the right math.
You didn't think I would be a child.
And of course work is also interesting.
Even though I'm not in great physical shape, I don't have such a good physical form.
I could pay for housing at reasonable prices if someone provided me with a room.
You talk a lot, so you might know someone.
Good day, the job is very interesting, but we don't speak Czech.
Who can we give things to?
The charitable organization Archiparhial Karitas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine Russian soldiers raiding women, their children forced to watch.
Then they can desecrate, defile the body and all of this is seen by the children.
Good day, I'm talking to you in my thoughts - I need to learn Czech language, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I often share my thoughts with you. It seems like you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that certain types of weaponry provided by Western partners have arrived too late.
He mentioned this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, according to "European Truth".
All the equipment, everything they have already sent, for some types of equipment it has been done too late.
When we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100% support, it's really true.
"Some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
In response to the question of whether Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have looked different.
She would have unfolded differently, we would have had close neighbors, we could have fought together.
"But I'm sure there was no war after all," he added.
We remind you that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can go home.
Please write to me about everything that will be needed.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender came from in our kitchen.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fake news and disinformation aimed at provoking panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public security.
I am from Ukraine, currently located in Plze≈à.
Before the war in Ukraine, she worked for 20 years as a designer of women's and children's clothing from various materials, and can also sew on special equipment and do embroidery.
I really want to work in my field, and I am happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this industry.
It's perfectly normal that you want to meet up. I was just joking.
Sure, you can do it that way.
Today I read that they should log into the system themselves.
They need to tell them and do something with them.
Great, I'll write tomorrow and let's agree on an exact time.
Please take a photo of some examples you solved.
Is she a good representative?
We went to this address to ask something from the school for some notebooks we might need, but we ended up in the wrong place.
And the mother's prayer is the most heartfelt.
I hear a lot - war on 10% of Ukraine's territory.
Why are people running away?
Why don't people live in territories where there is no war?
Are you in your glory?
Did you live in a warring state?
Prices have risen by 100-200%.
When most businesses are NOT WORKING.
When there is no way to make money.
When do children hear the air raid siren?
Did you live like that?
You can't even imagine.
May God forbid that we don't have it.
If they find out - it will be a horror.
We are running away.
Some of us are lost, with phones... that have stayed from our other life... so, some of us haven't adapted in a month.
Could you adapt in a month?
The state is giving us 5000 crowns.
Could you live on this money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you ever tried taking the subway with children in strollers?
When you are looking for food in one place, clothes in another, and don't have time to go to the third place.
Tomorrow we have to go again... because the food they gave us only lasts for one day.
Do you want to take care of yourself... but what about the children?
How to live without knowing a language?
Even if you can't ask for help.
There are free courses... but what to choose?
Searching for work, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
My children cannot be there.
Just understand us.
You come to the town hall and tell the receptionist that you are looking for Mrs. Krezkovska, if they do not give you directions and the number of her door.
It will be written on his door, he is the department head.
If you can't agree, call Dominic, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzkowska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her for a minute, she said she had an appointment before this, so she might be a bit late, but she knows about you and scheduled you for 9 o'clock so that you can make it to the doctor on time.
So, of course, it would be great to spend time together.
Please comfort me with kind words, you are like a balm to me...
She is easy to use and not expensive.
I really need the internet for work.
How can I connect to the internet?
Maybe someone has already been taken, so they are not lifting.
Good evening! Did we forget to write about those Czech language courses?
We already missed the first one.
I'm sorry because I really understand how I need this.
I have never talked about relationships, nor have I talked or expected any relationships.
Zuzana, the nurse gave us these papers. Please help me fill out what is needed.
Okay, I'll wait, I'm going to sleep, have a good night üòò
You have nature all around you and cheerful neighbors!
I found a place to live but it doesn't have any furniture or dishes. Could you help me find some nice furniture? Thank you.
On the first day of illness, you can arrange a diet with clean brought dishes (food).
Other days, the State Service of Supply does not have the right to subsidized state food.
After the food is taken home, the kitchen staff no longer bears responsibility for its quality and safety.
Hi Martin, please check if the refrigerator is working.
We will be delighted to meet her!
I really appreciate this kind of support!
Anita also mentioned Friday today, suggesting that she and Anna go to your center after Anna's school.
Unexpected acquaintance at the beginning of the battle with Polish brothers grew into a good friendship.
It's really great and pleasant to find people like you where you least expect and don't look for them)
The bank will submit an application for a loan on Monday.
By the way, about the return.
Yesterday you said that you are ready to accept me as your partner. And as your partner, I don't want any money back.
What's mine is yours.
You know this very well.
I will always be happy to make new acquaintances)
I really always doubt my own strength, and I need words like these!
We were home by 3:00 pm. We went with Cristina and her family to the castle in Visegrad.
I'm working all day tomorrow, until 12 at Fpoint, then I have English lectures, and in the evening I have to go to the language school office to get the keys to the classroom.
Sorry please.
Please, can you come at four o'clock?
Thank you, I'm feeling much better today.
I went to the store with my mom and sister.
We arrived, prepared food, and chatted.
I went out to the yard to take a breath of fresh air, tidied up a bit in the yard, because staying in the house all the time can be crazy.
If I knew, I would go with you.
According to the map, I saw that it was only 3 kilometers to them.
I would walk there, rather than take a trip from Brno. I'm looking for a convenient route.
That would be great. Thank you. If the MRI shows something, then we'll take a look.
We will be delighted to visit you!
Besides school, what other activities would help your child adapt to the Czech environment? (leisure and education)
Okay, if something can be found for me that would be great.
Write to the teacher to take a picture of her as a souvenir.
English: Thank you, then I will order for the whole week, do I need to write the child's surname when ordering or not?
Do you have any that will work?
Until 21 years old, I studied in Kharkiv at the Law Academy, and then went to work at the prosecutor's office.
My brother is coming to help with the kids so I can go to work.
During the day it was warm, but in the evening a cold wind blew.
You must be young and have lots of girls around you.
Everything has its pros and cons.
I have always wanted to visit Prague.
Grishko has already gone to the fair, but it's not that simple... He is crying very hard.
Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the kindergarten.
I didn't even touch the door and it's ringing.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that is the case, then I can, for example, work several hours a few days a week.
How many hours and on which days will I have to watch out for myself so that I can go to work and clean apartments, since they pay more for cleaning, so I don't want to give up that job?
I am a water supply technician so I immediately recognize the taste of water.
She said there were cheap and delicious cakes.
All in all, everything is good.
May I submit tests in these days?
I might go on live stream tonight if I'm allowed to go home for the night!) You'll see me üòá
There are currently three of us (me and two children aged 3 and 17), but possibly later a man will move in with us, as he is currently staying in a dormitory.
How long do the courses last and what level of language can be expected after completing them?
Awesome, so I'm free on Monday.
That would be very good for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book that teaches Czech language step by step.
The only thing I would really ask for is if it could be from 13:00-14:00, because I work until 12:30.
Will it be okay if I make it to that place in time?
Nothing after the war. Nothing that you didn't think of.
Answer me directly.
Do you want to be with me?
What do you feel towards me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can go there every weekend and not get bored.
Tell me how to get to the store?
In Czechia there are very nice people, I came on vacation to my children who are 10 and 15 years old and my grandmother (who is in Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ).
These women cannot be understood.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and enclosed yard between Yiglavo and Gavlichkuv Brod.
We have two small children.
We will provide a room.
The kitchen, bathroom, and other rooms are shared.
At the beginning of the month, the training will start on April 13th.
On the website, there is a photo of a TV. Please ask if it will be possible to come today.
He says he is comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If need be, we'll come up with something.
Thank you very much for your care.
We can meet up often.
My husband can bring it to you at home tomorrow or on Saturday, if that works for you.
He didn't call, it was passed on by word of mouth. I know for sure that God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the park by the river.
If you don't have a family of your own right now, when it comes it will be 10 times bigger and closer than it would have been.
I won't be able to download, I have an old phone. I don't speak German.
I believe they are looking for a pastry chef who speaks English.
To print this document as I made it, it must first be downloaded to the computer.
It should look like this.
Give us a vacuum cleaner tomorrow so we can clean up.
Then it depends on the weight and size...
Thank you, we already learned something similar.
All is well, we went for a walk, I'm very tired.
So if nobody can come, it won't be a problem?
I sent the documents to an email address.
Only in what state did we spend this time together....
I have many doubts before myself, and I can't keep them in.
Can you prepare the documents - the employment contract?
This robot is big, yellow, and strong. It is thirty-two years old.
I sent my mom another message.
Thank you, I need to do something, but I can't go anywhere... I need to cook and learn words... Can we go tomorrow at half past nine? We have an appointment for 11 o'clock for the courses.
Marina and I will help if you need assistance with the city.
I and my friend baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now a woman from Damelid called me and said that they had sent me information about further actions to my email but I still haven't responded.
She spoke Czech and I understood her so well.
I don't have an email from Damelido.
I need small pliers to pull up the dent on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity
We are looking for a lady for regular housekeeping here in the village.
The offer is 150 crowns/year.
Other cooperation according to satisfaction.
Agree on a date with the lady yourself.
Of course, but I'm throwing you off balance.
Men also have a lot of nuances.
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because I had my own perspective on life. I met him and then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after some time he called and said that he had undergone a heart operation.
Asking me to just talk to him and support him made me feel sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and thought he could buy me my toy and I could use his money.
Then he made me a proposal.
There was a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile and was making thunder.
They kept me in a house, then took me to a basement where there were many people, about 400 men, and there was nothing to breathe.
What about the housing you sent photos of?
I haven't arrived there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this hoax.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working normally.
Is there a dress code at work, or can I wear whatever I have?
Okay, he will come there and take them.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the internet.
One plus one is a presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting at all for me.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived for? Is he okay?
Diana didn't answer me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out some coloring pages for the kids. So that should be fine. When can I come by?
Maybe you will need a more detailed knowledge of Czech language.
I am anxious for you to be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but is studying in the Czech Republic in the field of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids and grandma?
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
Generally, it is hard to be in a foreign country, and with each passing day, one wants to go home more and more.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I will take it.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as comfortable as possible.
I will remember you for life.
I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

How do I pay?
I told her that the repair of the television and radio receiver was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to ask too many questions when they call.
We have been hiding information about the war from our grandmother for a whole month.
So far, it's working.
However, Plamka (cat - UP) has licked off the fur on her belly and back legs - this can be from stress, a change in diet, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two causes have been eliminated, but unfortunately the stress from me will remain.
Unlike a grandmother, a godmother is not deaf, she hears both sirens and explosions.
Thanks to Olga's poor hearing and her spending most of her time in her room, her niece lived in her apartment "incognito" for a month.
On April 1st, 1993, Oksana Polova held a gun for the first time in her life.
I lived with her in an apartment for 33 days like a partisan.
They kept both the war and what I was doing from her - I formally came over for a few hours as usual.
But when her friend finished talking, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time, the grandmother spends in her room.
I heard badly, which allowed me to be unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her footsteps, I would hide in my room.
She hid the receiver and television from her in advance.
Then she called everyone she talks to. That was 6-7 people.
She asked him to talk to her about anything except war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th is when I'm cleaning my two apartments :)
Good evening, I hadn't really thought about it :)
Hello, if you need our help tomorrow we can come.
Do I have to order lunch or can I bring my own? Do I need to print these documents or will they be printed on site and I just need to sign?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with a home visit. All interested parties please message me for pricing.
I understand you and won't complain, but in my situation I will be looking here for now.
I'm telling you, the embassy is only here.
A British soldier defending Mariupol in the trenches of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says they are ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier serving in the Ukrainian Navy Marine Brigade, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: The Twitter page of Aidan Eslien, a British serviceman who has served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, the RAF with a link to Eslien's family and friends, Atlas News with a link to the words of a friend of Eslien who spoke with him.
Eyslien's tweet: "We received a message from him: "It has been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon be over.
Details: Aislinn served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is taking part in the Mariupol defense operation.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Brenan Phillips, a military friend of Aislinn, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone conversation Aislinn had mentioned plans for their unit's capitulation.
According to him, the squad had run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Eyslin division had the intention to surrender to the Russian divisions in order to avoid being unarmed and defenseless against the so-called "cadres".
Also on social media, an audio recording of a phone conversation was shared, supposedly of Eyslin talking to her American friend who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislyn said that they had tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they had failed.
Earlier, a British man reported that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" had threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but between 2015 and 2017 he went to take part in the fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ZSU and took an oath.
Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, but on social media he is more known by his nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Are we together or not.
But it will be difficult, you will have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed, if everything is alright.
Thank you, no need for more, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful.
If you ever don't want to write to me, I will wait.
Hello Nataly, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would also like to learn Czech.
I wish you would take some time to rest and think about yourself.
Today you must definitely moisturize your face with a face cream.
Wow, thank you so much. I didn't even expect to find such a person. Wishing you good health and success!
Is Little Dushan no longer embarrassed?
Ondrej arrived with his father.
No one else came, even though there were many carolers walking down the street.
We are at home today.
The children have been learning their lessons, now they are playing.

How can I prove this love?
I want a chance for us to be together.

Let me make you happy.
Grandma can't, her legs and back hurt a lot.
How much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
My family is doing well, I have my mother, three brothers, and a husband left.
One brother was at war in Mariupol, another in Zaporizhia, and the man was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day saying everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to take care of some business first.
I will ask the man in the morning if he will be able to make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please let me know, I need to talk to Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers made up for their losses in battle in full.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, the young man Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit filled with earth".
According to the memories, "there was a dead silence in the city".
Someone from the villagers ran from house to house with a torch.
On the streets, the bodies of those shot by the Bolsheviks were encountered all the time.
Maybe I will really go with you. You need me. I can't be without you.
What activities or hobbies of yours have helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
Unfortunately, you won't be able to come because there is a railway reconstruction and the entrance is closed.
Come to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you have arrived and I will come to you.
We are looking forward to the best future.
Lena said that the items that didn't fit us can either be returned to you or given to Kate.
So, I stopped tossing and turning at night.
I usually wake up very early without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours, but I'm already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understand correctly, we will be sent a letter from school to order the menu.
Let's try to get to the social services on Tuesday.
Then, when the filling is cooled and the dough is ready, we roll out the pies and fry them in a small fire with oil.
Okay, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we are settled tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I don't fear work, as I have also lived in the village, so I can and like to work physically.
When can I bring you things?
Very interesting tradition you have, we do the same for Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere".
It is amazing that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the hypothetical Kyiv may somehow resolve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of the many new risks for public companies, but so far we are unaware of any company that has had the need to physically hold board meetings at their location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "undoing" all the gains of the hard-fought corporate reforms after the Dignity Revolution, including independent oversight boards, and then establishing manual control.
As it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who is supposed to be part of them?
Furthermore, if a harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, tomorrow other bills could be passed as well - for example, the system of state procurements through ProZorro or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine could be eliminated.
Much can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the draft law 7176.
So on February 22nd this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
Generally, the desire to disperse the oversight boards in one way or another has been circulating among certain elected officials for a long time.
Despite the criticism, let's analyze the arguments used to explain the necessity of the bill in order to show the possible consequences of it.
Then we will present our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during wartime.
Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the necessity of such a novelty due to the risks of losing internet and other communication tools, which would prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the board of directors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could paralyze the company's work.
Let's agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented for members of the supervisory boards to travel to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where independent board members (who make up the majority of the board) prioritize their own safety over the interests of the company and refuse to travel to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
Next, most likely, this will lead to a lack of quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
It will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members to the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection process which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed solution by Bill 7176 is unlikely to save the oversight board from losing its decision-making power, and may even lead to it!
The people's deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha, provides other arguments in support of it.
He further states: "Many businesses, including the defense-industrial complex (DIC), now require relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information with someone from Vinnitsa over Zoom".
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises with supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board of "Ukroboronprom" is essentially the body that manages almost all of the state-owned enterprises of the Defense Industry.
Even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the law, the supervisory board has limited powers and all its members fulfill their duties on a non-remunerative basis.
All the authority in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who will also make decisions regarding the necessity of relocating any of the OPK enterprises that are part of the conglomerate.
Additionally, this argument is not valid because Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the laws governing the activities of state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be attributed to the "emotional" category.
These arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "Respected foreign experts, at the first mention of 'war' in 2021, will leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with full salaries in the tens of thousands of hryvnias, while Ukraine itself will really suffer from the war".
First of all, this is manipulation - most of these board members have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
It is unfair to say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly.
Additionally, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is widely used in global practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also important to remember that membership on the oversight board is not a full-time job.
Generally, such people have other occupations and electronic communication tools help them with this.
Thirdly, all of these statements are read as complaints exclusively towards foreigners.
Interesting, why doesn't Mr. Dmytro express the same claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Even they don't know where their companies are located.
To be sure, this is far from the first populist attempt by legislators to remove foreigners from oversight boards, and war is just a convenient excuse.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary accommodation with a family. I have two children with me.
Five rockets struck my hometown of Lviv.
My soul is filled with a quiet joy. I look at Josie and see her happiness, the confidence in her steps.

Yes, I understand what needs to be done.

We usually require one of the adults to have a passport.
In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky, and Buchansky districts of Kyiv Oblast, which were liberated from the occupiers, an increased curfew will be imposed for two days.
Pavluk's direct words: "In the settlements of the Brovarskyi, Vyshhorodskyi and Buchanskyi districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
Restrictions will be in effect in these towns and villages from 9:00 PM on April 2nd to 6:00 AM on April 5th.
According to the head of the regional administration, it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of populated areas and other public places, to travel by public transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during an alarm signal to take shelter.
These restrictions are being imposed in order to mitigate the consequences of Russian aggression - to cleanse and exchange territories.
Omelianyk called on people who had left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM.
I haven't received anything from school yet, only a payment receipt.
Do you lack important information? If so, what type and kind?
We have prepared some pierogies for you to try. They need to be boiled for 7 minutes.

I will tell you honestly, I always used to be the one to leave a person first, but then they would ask for forgiveness and try to restore the relationship.
It wasn't necessary for me anymore if I was disappointed in someone forever.

Over the last six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of its army, the renewal of military equipment, and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the possibility of escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime arrested three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Sources: "Radio Svaboda", the human rights center "Viasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA".
The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that on the night of March 30th, three residents of Bobruisk were arrested with the support of special forces "SOBR", and one was injured.
According to "Vyasnya", when the man was detained, he actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the arrested persons was injured and is currently in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The Chief of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly suppressed by law enforcement officers using weapons."
On April 6th it was announced that on March 30th police had arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the "BZHD" and an administrator of the "BZHD" themed resources in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki", Valentin Samasjuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for diverting.
We remind you that BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on railway transport and infrastructure objects in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "guerrilla partisans" are thus attempting to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, Russia is transferring troops and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.
This is to boost self-esteem.

We are currently a few hours away from Prague, we have a car and we are willing to pay partially for accommodation.
It doesn't matter if it's a city or a village, it's preferable to have a separate accommodation.

Can I ask you for a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile plan if you have time? Is it already too late?
The US is prohibiting investments in Russia and imposing sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and also banning all new investments in Russia.
This will be discussed in the White House website announcement.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a full ban on new investments in Russia.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the resolution adopted by over 600 multinational companies to exit Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," according to a White House statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the US was restrictions against major Russian state-owned enterprises in critical sectors.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the following day on Thursday.
The final part of the package includes a full asset freeze of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter, and members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the journey is closed off and I will come to you.
Believe, can we already wash the dishes in the dishwasher?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, and my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived happily and never thought we would have to flee, for there was no strength left to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
We have hope that someone will take us in for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's within our means.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help at this difficult time for us.
After lunch I had one English lecture and after that I went to work in a children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood everything and will do it well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and we talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
This is free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira is not answering the phone, she is not responding, I don't know if she made it to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: halting investments and suspending supplies.
We didn't understand each other.
No military personnel have settled in our house.
Our house is located near a military base and an oil depot.
He was just helping me because I couldn't do it myself.
I cook delicious food, don't ask for too much, and give good advice.
I give myself advice.
It's a bit hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We will meet at four o'clock and I will tell you everything.
Overall, everything is good.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have the program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I haven't written to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, please let me know.
I would happily share a place with a respectable girl.
If you know someone like that, let me know.
I won't let you down from my side.
Thank you in advance.
I haven't written to you about another person, Natalya, who is 54 years old. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it would be best for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's been the same since I was born :)
Good day Mr. Reyarade! Sorry I haven't seen it. I'll do it right away and send it to you immediately.
We are going to the medical commission now.
English: So Anne needs to make up this hour on another day.
On which day should she come earlier? (Maybe on a day with a bit more work?)
Tomorrow I will listen, the Internet is not working well. Hopefully.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you... we found some items, but there was nothing with the technology.
Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, know nothing.
Nothing is happening.
Can we do it on Monday 25th April?
You can bring children with you, there are plenty of toys here :)
I figured out about Grandpa.
Probably I'm very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We will somehow make it happen.
Please no credit, but how will this be paid for?
Write to me directly and I will help.
We are your partner, or we are not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do I need to take the items they gave me?
Today is not my day. The blinds broke in the living room. One this morning and now another in the evening.
Something from you has arrived, I don't see what it is.
I am also very sad.
I will remind you about the invoice later.
Do you only have your dad who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am sorry to be taking you away from your duties.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about my son - he is alive and well.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically researches the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
The journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, Natalia Nagorna, released a video recording on the morning of April 12th that was sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military tells him that they have no weapons left to fight with, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill is going up by the hour".
Before this, on April 11th, a separate brigade of marine infantry, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11th could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
On social media, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has assured that communication with the defense forces in Mariupol is in place and the details of the defensive operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped an unknown toxic substance on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletskyi, the Russian army has used chemical weapons against the Azovstal plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will accommodate myself to you. That would be very nice.
The situation is what it is, for now we stay here.
Two hours of riding around, Mom shopping, and back home!
It doesn't matter.
She forgot what to do here.
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy strongholdüí•.
Two Ukrainian and two Czech brothers "Ptashok" were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council, Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today their inter-village friends, led by the head of the local council and coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for a special purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the efficiency and safety of drones, the locations of their deployment will remain a secret for now.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic have no plans to stop and say that in the coming days they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I like sweets but I can do without them.
I'm worried that we won't make it. We have a lot of luggage.
I'm soon returning to Ukraine to work further.
English: Okay. If everything is alright, I agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you if that's okay?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the mayor's house in the village in Ivano, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing.
Maybe she will be cheered up and her mood will be lifted.
They repaired my phone for me today.
I think I'm going to freeze outside today too.
I took medicine and tea, I feel worse but not critically.
I'm sorry too, but let's meet up when I'm feeling better.
When you have time, send me some music that you like.
I'm curious what musical accomplishments you have üòä
Parents should be listened to.
You will find him near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was colder here and it was raining. Tomorrow it is supposed to be warm.
Alas, not only the ruined houses are a pity, but also the people who are oppressed by the occupiers.
In Kharkiv, the occupiers desecrated the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is reported that unknown individuals tore down the European Union flag, ripped off panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They lowered the flag.
Good morning, thank the children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
In Czech there is someone to talk to if needed.
I live in a dormitory. There will be twelve people here and then they will go to work.
Hello, it's a little better now.
Today I already went to the fair.
Even today it has already slept there.
We have already made great progress.
I will definitely bring pierogies for everyone else too!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am scheduling days and times for apartment cleaning after guests, I can roughly say April month as I already have a rough schedule for apartment cleaning.
In May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just wondering if you have anything to say about this...
Hi, sorry I haven't been in touch, I was preparing dinner and had a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come over today?
Let's meet after you arrive.
He is modest here, has been studying a lot lately. He realized that this is very necessary for him in life.
Hi) Everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people at such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with the director of the regional economics department, Ms. Vysokaya.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well at the fair.
On Monday I need to bring proof of employment and cash payment for the lessons.
I'm running away from Friday.
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking lots of water ‚òùüèª)
If I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you if possible.
I have to bring one more analysis.
No, we won't have to go again.
The drain is working very badly, not draining well. We need a master. It needs to be fixed.
So there is not enough there.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you signed up for.
Do children need to bring anything with them when they go there?
Now, quickly, can I come to you with one question?
If you need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, are you celebrating Easter today?
We didn't really want you to collect money so people wouldn't think we were profiting from this!
However, for online filling out I was not enough with two points:
I will be going to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
Wow, what a great idea! I'll watch the video now. It will be great because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University is calling on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and posts.
Only rely on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I have gathered several works for my portfolio.
After the holidays they will have to do an internship.
I would like to be your backup designer.
Will I be paid for the day I was absent from work?
Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine.
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
It is not excluded that the Russian Federation Armed Forces may carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against its neighboring state.
Details: The enemy continues to build up an offensive force for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
It is likely that in the coming days, the occupiers will attempt to regain the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and deploy personnel, weapons, and equipment for combat operations on Ukrainian territory.
Preparation of armaments and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the specified armaments will be relocated to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
To replenish the personnel losses of the battalions of the tactical group of the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is being carried out.
The enemy is facing a particular problem when staffing drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the combat zones, will continue to attack transportation infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to fulfill tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
Separate units from the 6th General Army and the Northern Fleet coastal troops are continuing partial blockade of the city of Kharkov and artillery shelling of certain districts of the city on the Slobozhansky direction.
Air reconnaissance of the local area is taking place on the Izium direction in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy is using the UAV "Orlan-10".
The enemy attempted to launch an attack in the directions of the populated places of Dovghenke and Dmytrivka with the forces of two battalions of tactical groups, but was unsuccessful and retreated to their previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to launch a raid in the Golden area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the sea port with the help of artillery and aviation.
Enemy forces conducted artillery bombardments of Ukrainian troops' positions in the areas of the settlements of Visokopillya, Trudolyubivka, and Maryanske.
In the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, Ukrainian defenders repelled four enemy attacks in the past day, destroying five tanks, eight pieces of armored equipment, six vehicles, and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will try to make it on time, but I'm doubtful.
How can you sleep when I'm keeping you up?
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
If you don't feel like seeing each other today, just let me know, I understand.
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up.
I'm turning on the TV here just to listen to Czech language.
I'm out of my monthly plan today :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads.
I understand that I can prepare material in this field.
I will ask her. I'm a bit embarrassed to ask, since she already gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, for sure.
I read an ad on Facebook, so Google must have written something about it. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we have taken the items you brought, but are there any small items that we can bring to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director agrees, I can start working from next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if I can, because there are very long lines) and it's raining on Saturday.
I am looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I am studying Czech language to perfect my knowledge, I dream of working in Prague.
Friends old and not so old, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
Many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Through those who are subjecting Ukraine to your name.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Sasha replied concisely, as usual, "Let's talk about it later - for now, let's go explore the ruins after the search."
Other cultural figures, artists, critics, writers are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of villains and fascists, most of you hate them.
Let's be honest: except for a very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduza, Navalny's organization, and a few other places - how many of you did anything to oppose this regime?
Besides attending the rallies when they still took place,
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to Hide, Late to Be Silent".
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they were provoked by your long indifference to what was happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which now surely weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like this.
In the 1990s there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even bloody, but real.
1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally get a revolution, you are ultimately overcome with such a strong fear of chaos that you seek refuge behind a king, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he has killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Yes, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and exposing the archives of the KGB, as the Nazis did with their Gestapo, you diverted your attention to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, regenerate, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were presented with the choice between invading a country and bringing back the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and resignedly accepted the invasion.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern became survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, and aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you all either voted for it or gave preference to not voting at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya to the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and have fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I had witnessed: the tortures of innocent civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Enough of your Chechnya already". I remember those words very well.
In response, I said: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, not mine.
I'm just a bad foreigner here.
Your government is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
No, it was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic boom in the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well off, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest among you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices have risen, so why is that a bad thing?
Moscow sparkled and glittered with splendor.
When several opposition members ‚Äì Yuriy Shekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what had happened.
However, things didn't go as planned.
When Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev after two terms and took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or remained silent about it.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we probably haven't done much on the West if we've done anything at all.
A little bit of outrage, a few sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is loudly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and internal market exists?
Living in Russia was good.
After the difficult 1990s, this was the most important.
Nevertheless, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you all woke up.
When Putin once again swapped places with Medvedev and planted himself in the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that this was too much and you took to the streets in protest en masse.
Navalny's name became famous, you hadn't been on the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing its footing.
After that, he struck back in response.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons filled up with people.
Thousands were left behind the gates.
Someone received generous terms.
What could we do?
I've heard it so often and I'm still hearing it.
"The state is so strong, but we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the Russian president who had dashed their European hopes, they seized Maidan once and never left it.
They built a makeshift town completely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to break in, they began to defend themselves with clubs, pipes, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
Instead of running away, the protesters went on the attack.
Many people died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to choose their leaders and remove them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not please Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
He took advantage of the general confusion and seized Crimea.
Someone of you was against it, but there was little benefit from it.
How many of you were taken captive!
From what I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who had been disparaging Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It is hard for me to find a reason, since right after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly stayed silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
You have been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, all newly restored after the renovation started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their bike paths, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Truly, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You have recently paid attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then, because I knew nothing at all about what was going on in Syria.
At least I went there and saw with my own eyes how the state snipers of Homs were cold-bloodedly shooting at my children's teenagers on the streets.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there in 2015, who began bombing thousands of innocent civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I stayed silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to speak up in my defense.
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Who among you did this?
However, the majority remained silent.
Someone is really speaking out now, like, for example, Dmytro Hlukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maxym Osypov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak out from abroad, while some, like Marina Ovsiannikova, risk ending up in a new GULAG or joining Navalny's company from within the country.
As for others, it is best known to you in which country you live.
I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails - he will turn to you.
To all of you, my friends: to those who bravely, but mostly alone, have gone out to protest and have so far endured a short term, but soon will face a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, expressed dissent on social media (even if it was just a black square on Instagram), or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Hours, when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for a joke, are not so far in the past - and now they, with great probability, await you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
Example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - are challenging the Putin regime: they demonstrate that it can be fought.
And what reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage may be on paper.
Taking everything into account, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is still ongoing.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
Putin knows that you know.
Be prepared for it.
You understand where this is going.
Good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a sham, your laws are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media outlets are gone, your economy is crumbling faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket on a plane abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin won't be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
If you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to negotiate or you will be disappointed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet one remains.
Finally, this regime will collapse.
In the current circumstances, you may need to do less than you think.
Think about it.
A spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse looming over Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
If prices drop and salaries are not paid, those people who have voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
If each city holds its own rallies as they have been doing periodically, it will be easy for them to be suppressed one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which can be restricted, but still works and can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was crushed, but others can be created, more informal and more decentralized.
You are many, you are millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly up to 100,000.
If more than 300 thousand come out, she will be amazed.
It will be necessary to use an army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all he forced them to go through in Ukraine, what did he force them to endure?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those with children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared too if I were in your place.
With the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to defy their master, who dare not only to demand freedom but actually try to get it.
Even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
If your son makes a joke in an online game chatroom, he will be arrested; if your daughter expresses her anger online, she will be arrested; if your close friend makes a mistake, he will die in a Syrian prison under the police batons.
This has been happening for many years now - and it will only continue to grow, taking on ever larger and larger scales.
You have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how this will end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday and we were told that we could come back on Monday.
We will be home in the evening.
What do you take me for, a press secretary?
How often do you go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner, age?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain it all to her.
English: We really liked it and wanted something better so this is the best option.
I was in a room with a lot of people and I felt drained of energy.
I'm feeling bad, coughing, fever, lost my voice, weakness, and dizziness.
I must go to that job.
We have already done it, but those who registered in April will only receive money at the end of the month.
We need a pass for four, we are going to the doctor with the children.
Last night I received a message from a lady who liked my work and wanted something from me in her house.
I'm waiting for news from her and I will definitely let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a challenging, responsible, and intellectual job that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a shame to have lost the time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life I am sociable, but single and serious about marriage.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I believe that for a family to be created, people must love, respect, and trust each other.
