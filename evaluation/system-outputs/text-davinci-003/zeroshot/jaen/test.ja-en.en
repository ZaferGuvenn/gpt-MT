I tried to buy an entry package and two packages came out, one blue and one orange.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What is the difference?
I couldn't figure it out by researching, so please tell me.
There should only be blue now.
If so, there may only be old products left.
They look different, but they are the same.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who would be stronger if two people fought with the same height and weight?
Jiu-Jitsu
Generally, karate only practices sparring with other karate practitioners.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, especially, is practiced with the inclusion of dealing with strikes, etc.

Was the "Destiny Plan" in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation against Durandal for being betrayed by Talia?
Because of genetic incompatibility, they had to break up because they couldn't have children, so is the genetic compatibility really that accurate?

I don't feel like watching TV anymore since there's stuff like that...
Is it that the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
Yesterday I watched "Iroha Chidori" on Netflix, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
It's creepy that people laugh at everything a popular comedian says, even if it's obviously not funny.
But if the staff don't laugh, it'll ruin the comedian's mood, and it'll be awkward in terms of working together, right?
It seems like that industry is like a black company from the past, and it's kind of like a sports club, and some of the celebrities have such huge egos that they take on unpleasant attitudes, so I guess they have to do that in order to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who emphasize the difficulty of their work by saying "Don't belittle comedians" all the time.
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but it's hard to be an entertainer and it's like I'm always being told to reach the top of the difficult job.
It sounds like a justification for enhancing one's own career and for comedians having too high a standing in the media and society.
Honestly, there are some tough parts to the industry I'm working in, but I feel like the demands on entertainers are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
Sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart.

I had my order from the Tsutaya Net Shop replaced without my permission.
I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale, but the wired version of the mouse arrived instead. I was told that if I wanted a refund, I would have to return it.
Rather than talking about self-built PCs, it's a problem with online shopping, but I can't make sense of it no matter how I think about it, so I'll post it here since it's a well-known place.
I discovered that the MSI Wireless Gaming Mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen on the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday, which was the beginning.
At the store, since the wired version was the same price, I checked the page for the wired version to consider the possibility of a pricing mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Linked to Fish Tako), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order email normally and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and my purchase history page.
From the lack of communication or cancellation notifications from the order to the shipment, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
Here is the problem: a few hours after shipping, we received an email saying there was a mistake in the product registration.
According to that email.
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose the response.
It seems that they sent the wired version instead of the wireless version even though the product page is divided into wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note all say wireless version.
Isn't it unfair that they sent me the wrong item without my consent and now they want me to return it and get a refund without them paying for the return shipping?
In the end, I want to fight back somehow and accept the refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Residents of Yabuki Town in Fukushima Prefecture, who were isolated twice due to typhoons and heavy rain, have tripled their stockpiled food supplies as the only bridge connecting the district has been washed away (Fukushima Television).
Mr. Koushiro Matsumoto from Takachiho Haraichi District, Yamatsuri-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a big impact on living with 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like, 'Really?'"
I felt like, "Will it be broken so suddenly? Will it be washed away?" The only road connecting the Takachi Plain district, "Takachi Plain Bridge," was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water supply cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is usually not open to the public, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Matsumoto: "Usually I can drive to the garden, but this time I had to get out of the car and carry or carry it across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the convenience of having a car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge that was completed a month later was washed away by a heavy rain in less than three months, and the isolated state was restored for a few days until the temporary bridge was put in place.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures to learn from the experience.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
I was thinking that I would like to secure at least two to three days worth of food, so I have stocked up about three times more than before the disaster in terms of canned food and cup noodles that can be used as emergency rations.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "Since you never know when a disaster might strike you personally, I felt again that it would be better for everyone to have some supplies prepared. On the other hand, Yatsushiro Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" with a bridge being washed away."
The town started its own initiative in 2021 to ensure that lessons are not forgotten.
Yaji-machi Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryuichi: "We have established October 12th as 'Yaji-machi Disaster Prevention Day' and we have announced that we would like to use this day to think about disaster prevention measures from now on."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Is there anyone I can rely on for administrative matters?
I'm sorry, I don't know anything about support groups, but it seems like there might be some if you look for them...
According to my recollection, Hiro Yuki said in one of his videos that if you have a bad relationship with your parents, you should go to an organization that provides food, clothing, and shelter, and even if they tell you not to go, they will somehow help you (I'm not sure). So I think there must be such an organization.
Experience a ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event on December 12, 2021, where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course for the Paralympic Games.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were provided, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment to run on a simulated Paralympic marathon course in a virtual space.
Each tablet projecting the virtual space will have its own avatar appear, allowing participants from both inside and outside the country to experience a marathon-like competition while running the course together. Additionally, they can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
Running through the streets of Tokyo like this is tough, but it's really fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and it's great to be able to compete with everyone and do our best until the end. The Tokyo representative said they want to make sure people can enjoy it in sports gyms and other places, and they plan to set it up starting from the new year.

Be careful when buying a mid-aged house!
The pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The new "Building Condition Survey" system established to revitalize the mid-aged housing market is doing well, with mid-aged housing transactions being favorable.
The prices of both detached houses and condominiums are increasing, and the renovation market is also expanding.
During the coronavirus pandemic, there has been an increase in people looking for homes, and there has been a concentration of popularity in properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large scale", and "tower", which have become more expensive. This has likely had an effect on the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly built properties.
Looking at the images in this article, however, the share of existing (used) housing circulation in Japan remains at a relatively low level compared to overseas.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) amended part of the Real Estate Transaction Business Law, and started a survey called "inspection" for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used houses, known as the Building Condition Survey. (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf)
This is a system where an architect who is knowledgeable in housing checks the current state including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, which can give the buyer a sense of security.
This can also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits.
Under the current system, the main party responsible for building condition surveys is usually the seller.
Additionally, we should pay attention to the fact that only the announcement of the inspection system was made mandatory.
In other words, while real estate agents have the obligation to explain to customers whether they can "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey when mediating a property" or not, the actual implementation of the survey is not mandatory.
In the US and UK, where the used market is thriving, similar systems have already been established for inspections led by the seller, which address the risks of concern.
Before a residential purchase, there is a system in which the buyer requests a building inspection from an expert known as an inspector or building surveyor.
In the case of the United States, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of existing home transactions, depending on the state.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller's side will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, and to sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
The buyer side, on the other hand, is considering that they want to be able to live comfortably after examining the survey contents and making appropriate repairs.
Even though it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the objectives and intentions of both sides.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection survey mandated by the government shall remain to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects. For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller may be conducted.

Was Ginza an island?
Five pieces of trivia you can talk about while drinking silver beer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula in the past.
In Ginza, you can show off your knowledge of trivia such as "as evidence of that...".
Here is a fun fact about Ginza that you may not know, but you'll want to tell someone about it!
Go up to Ginza!
Entering the Golden Throne for the first time.
When walking around Ginza, you can find traces of its history everywhere, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
She and I were walking in Ginza when suddenly we were met with a silence. "This used to be a peninsula," she said.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza, the synonymous term for the bustling shopping district that created "○○ Ginza" throughout Japan, located in Chuo Ward, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint where silver coins were made, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawachō", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
It is said that in the past, the area near Ginza was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza, and a bay called "Iri-guchi" extended from Hibiya to Marunouchi.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo and proceeded to fill in the bay and develop the Kyobashi district.
Tokugawa Ieyasu further developed the city blocks and dug canals to promote boat transportation.
And they dug out the earth from the moat and cut down the Kanda mountain, filling in the inlet.
There is a stone monument called "The Birthplace of Ginza" in front of the Ginza Tiffany Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office, so why not take a look if you are interested.
Only those in the know are aware of the "pilgrimage to Ginza," a sacred place in Ginza.
In Ginza, there is an annual "pilgrimage" known as "Ginza Hachibei Shrine Meguri" that only those in the know are aware of.
The most noticeable of the more than 10 shrines would be the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theatre.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are often people who come to pray before and after the performance.
On the one hand, the "Ryuko Fudōson" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and the "Ginza Dejō Jizōson" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" are located in the back of an alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwai Inari Shrine" is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the 1F entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where a fox greets you was built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, believing that it would bring the benefit of "abundant harvest of the five grains" where rice grows well.
As a result, it is said that there are benefits to business prosperity in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and faith spread even in Ginza, Japan's most prosperous city.

I went to the dentist two days ago because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been numbed and the hole remains open.
He said it was to get rid of the pain quickly.
Before the treatment, I experience a sharp pain when I touch my tooth. Will it get better in a few days?

South Korean Posco International has acquired Australian Senex Energy, expanding its overseas gas field business - South Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it has signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year, pending the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the local corporation's approval of the procedures.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount was 7709 billion won, of which Posco International and Hanhock Energy decided to invest 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the hydrogen market in half with green hydrogen, leading to the decision to make this acquisition.
Posco International will acquire 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Could it be that the pain in your knee is "osteoarthritis"?!
Depending on the cause, different medical treatments (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
The editorial department: I have been having knee pain lately.
What potential illnesses are there?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injury, arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "Rheumatoid Arthritis".
Editing Department: Is it that the joint has become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which helps to absorb shocks and make the movement of the joints smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can become worn down or distorted.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Editing Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in places other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Outside of the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, the base of the fingers, the neck, the waist, the big toe, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editing Department: So, what kind of structure does a joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where the two bones meet is covered with articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by a joint capsule.
Editing Department: So it has a complex structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
There is a tissue called synovial membrane in the inner layer of the joint capsule, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid plays a role as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making knee movements smoother, which is why they are recommended.
Editing Department: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, playing a role.
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause deformity of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash, I sleep in a tracksuit or something!
Are there people who can quit smoking even if they are heavy smokers, and people who cannot quit smoking?

Experience the "Kaiji" series of gambling and games with three real sound selections - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series of gambling manga, which boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where lives are at stake.
Just looking at it makes my feet tingle... Taking on the challenge of a steel beam walk!
For this time, I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can be played in reality or demonstrated in a planning video.
"Swamp" is a pachinko machine full of traps that appeared in the gambling abstinence record "Kaiji".
In the original work, Kaizi was astonished by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had a large trap set up with "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Curl", and it was said to be almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl aquarium on Bill's building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen for one ball", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held as a pastime by the wealthy, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in a "Human Horse Race" across a steel girder.
The debtor must proceed carefully so as not to fall off the thin steel girder set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people participated, and the top two were able to win a prize, but there were only four steel beams, and the safety measures were inadequate, so the possibility of death was quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is possible to experience something very similar at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home stadium of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge has a single iron bridge extending to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and beyond it are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge", which can be reached by walking.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi of the owarai genre posted a video of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube channel, claiming that it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
English: "E-Card," a two-player card game.
Play with 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into Emperor side and Slave side.
This game is very well made, with the emperor being strong to the citizens, the citizens being strong to the slaves, and the slaves being strong to the emperor.
Kaiji plays a game of chance against Tonegawa with the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have to cut off his own ear.
After a hard-fought battle, Kaiji realized that his ears were being read by a device that could detect and transmit changes in pulse and body temperature, like the earphones he had attached to his ears. In order to confuse Rinkai-gawa and win, he shaved his ears to the extreme and put his body in an abnormal state.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from places like Amazon.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, uploaded a video on YouTube where he competed with actor Ryuuya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji, using an E-Card, and it caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the Kaiji feeling?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Experience the world of the game through playing it.
Taking the first step towards the New Year, gently pushing forward: A large votive horse of the Tora Shrine in Yamagata Prefecture | Yamagata Shimbun
A large votive horse of the zodiac animal for next year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared at the prefectural shrine (Yamagata City) as preparations for the New Year progress.
Design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine on the 11th and held an offering ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from the National Art Institute to create the original drawings for the ema since two years ago.
Nine students from the Japanese Painting Course, led by Professor Sue Nagatoshi, had their works selected from this time, with Yu Tsuchiya (age 22) being chosen.
The large picture horse is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya-san said that he painted an image of a cherry blossom pushing gently on one's back as they step into the new year.
I stopped and looked at the tiger admiring the cherry blossoms, wishing that even in a rapidly changing world, it could have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature.
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on the ema that are distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonen-gi said, "I think I can be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano that we want to keep living in" - Proposal for a City-wide 4 High School Student Workshop: San-Digital, Yamaguchi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano in 2030 be like?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together in a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the voices of young people will be compiled and proposed to the mayor.
What makes you happy?
The students answer in unison to the facilitator's questions, such as "when having a lot of people around" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sun Rise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns with a sense of purpose" using the World Cafe method, where each group moves to a different "island" with a predetermined theme.
Write each idea on a sticky note and organize them by sticking them on a poster board.
It seems interesting that there are many young people in this town. It is essential to have transportation such as trains and buses for convenience.
Let's talk further to see if we can find any common ground.
Tamano, an 18-year-old student in the third year of Tamano Commercial High School, thought that Tamano was boring, but found it attractive that they could go cycling by the sea.
Binnan High School third-year students (18) talked with adults, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have so much nature," and seemed to realize not only the issues of the area but also its appeal.
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the education director and make an announcement in February of next year.
The President of the East Center said, "We should foster a sense of local attachment among high school students, and provide them with an opportunity to take an active role in community development."

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of approximately 50 kilometers.
The estimated magnitude of the earthquake is M5.0.
There is no concern about a tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake varies by location.
Areas with a seismic intensity of 4 include Kuki and Kasama-Ishii (Ibaraki), Ota-Nishimotocho (Gunma), Saitama-Iwatsuki-ku (Saitama), and Kazo (Saitama).

How to tie a new knot for a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Do you ever find that the fabric of your scarf bunches up around your neck when you wear it in the winter?
I often hear people say that they don't quite understand the trick to adjusting their balance while looking in the mirror after tying their obi, but it is a good idea to do so.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be quickly wrapped around, but then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
When you look closely, it is tailored into one piece by weaving the cloth that has been cut into long and thin strips, and the whole is like a net pattern.
The mesh of the net has been designed so that the edges of the stopper can pass through.
Therefore, you can wind and secure it without connecting the ends.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests are popular, but many people will likely wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stole.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting!
Peter Jackson directed a movie called "Get Buck".
It feels like a raw, life-sized Beatles, and it's refreshing in various ways...
We're on the brink of disbanding, so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not as dramatic as I had imagined.
While trying my best to keep things organized, there was Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying but come on!" attitude; George, who was hesitant and kept saying "but, like..."; John, who was always late and didn't seem very motivated; and Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a troubled expression on his face.
We don't hate each other enough to fight, but there's a very familiar feeling of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had a similar atmosphere. It's like a legendary breakdown or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is overflowing with talent.
We both get really excited as we go from a small phrase to "that famous song" while asking each other "how about this?"
The moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hmm-like humming gradually turns into a zu-cha♪ zu-cha♪ and the scene where the lyrics come in is recorded perfectly, it's amazing.
It's amazing that we can see the process of composing like this so rarely.
Everyone is so full of energy during the performance that just watching it can make you feel happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has aired so far, but my impression is that the biggest cause of the Beatles' break-up was more the environment around them than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them started to have fun making music, despite their complaints, but when it came to talking about where to do their live performance, the producer and other people in charge of promotion started talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying things like "Let's make them the best in the world!", and it was easy to see that they had taken control of the situation.
Well, since documentaries involve the director's interpretation, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way, but...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it is the reason why there are a lot of scenes where Paul seems like a villain.

How strong is Guts from "Berserk" compared to "Demon Slayer"?
Can I be a pillar?
I can't get used to it.
Do not call out the technique name before performing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you must be feeling a sense of responsibility and it's making you lose your peace of mind.
I think it's hard to just get by these days, isn't it?
I used to work in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I realized that I'm really suited for sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it's been much easier to work.
I was asked about things I couldn't do, but I think if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, it will make my life going forward a little easier.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest before considering this, so that you can have peace of mind.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there are organizations in the company, industrial doctors, or consultation windows, it may be possible to consult them and there may be some system. I think it would be good to consult once.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

There have been many tornadoes in the United States causing significant damage, due to the unseasonably warm temperatures and strong cold fronts (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From Friday night (10th) to Saturday (11th) local time, tornadoes have been occurring frequently in the southern United States.
For this period, it is believed that strong cold air from the south affected the atmospheric conditions to become very unstable due to the record-breaking warmth, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperatures on Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) are expected to reach near 30°C.
Due to the strong cold air below -30°C near 5500m in the upper atmosphere, a vigorous frontal system was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The Southern United States is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record-breaking amount.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and strong winds on Friday (10th) local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength (on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) reached the third strongest level on the six-level scale, with gusts of wind reaching up to 70 m/s.
There is a possibility that it will be classified as an EF4-5 according to future surveys.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita Scale and adapted to the conditions of Japanese buildings.
The JEF3 tornado equivalent to the one in the US this time has a high possibility of occurring in Japan as well, and it is at a level where wooden houses collapse.

Voices calling for help from beneath the "largest in history" debris pile were broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
President Biden expressed his view with a solemn expression on the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States on the 11th (Japan time 12th), calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
According to reports from CNN and other television networks.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do whatever it takes."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
Residents of Kentucky, which was affected by tornadoes, carry household items such as furniture from a destroyed house. Tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, exceeding 30.
The record of a 219-mile (approximately 350-kilometer) tornado that caused damage in Missouri in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the largest scale at around 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadowfield, which suffered the greatest damage, even the candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas rush suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
In the darkness, a woman who had become unable to move under a pile of rubble about 1.5 meters thick, felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above the rubble, and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In the live broadcast that was made public, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the sound of a woman singing "Happy Birthday To You" while crying, seemingly to distract from her fear, could also be heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, took shelter in her basement with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was unharmed.
He looked back and said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, like something was erupting."
The police officers of the Meifield City Police will continue the search operations until they are no longer necessary.
He kept up his desperate rescue efforts, not knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed, resulting in at least six confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of the cars being separated, and the highway has been blocked due to the effects of vehicle overturns.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes in Tennessee, including 130,000, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What can I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks.
Avoid rough-cut fresh vegetables.
It would be good to do such things.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be great if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"Attending physicians" are doctors in their third to fifth year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Postgraduate Trainee Doctor".

There has been an old saying that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
Other countries base their ratings on a 5-star system, subtracting points from there, while Japan claims to use a 3-star system as a neutral point, adding or subtracting points from there.
At the baseline, there is already a two-star difference, and four stars mean completely different meanings - "there are elements that detract from the score" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we base our ratings on a five-star system, then a work with no flaws is on the same level as a work of the highest quality, so if that is the trend, then it would be a system flaw to not present the meaning of the stars. However, since this system is currently being used in this way, I understand why you would not want to give a three-star (negative) rating.
Therefore, if one tries to refute those who advocate this kind of rhetoric with a two-choice evaluation on Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fits a standard hose size?
The power capacity that can be taken from a USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The water pump depends on the item, but at least it consumes 500W, so it's impossible.

The Roll of My Own Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I had tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from what was expected, right?
Here's the main point: I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
Why do you think so? Is that even possible?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
Mods that use ESP for distributing textures and meshes can be deployed as loose files in the appropriate location without needing an ESP.
I remember seeing something about that somewhere, but I can't remember where I saw it...
I understand the risks, so I don't plan on actually doing it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, could you please tell me if it's okay to do?
Thank you for your submission.

"Saga Eating Log": "Hakobune's" "Freshly-Caught Fish and Shrimp Fries with Homemade Tartar Sauce from the Nearby Sea" | Living & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box with freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fries, homemade tartar sauce.
"Hakobune", a take-out specialty store with a colorful bento box and deli (souzai) full of plenty of vegetables.
Koyuki Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple opened last August with the aim of allowing people to experience the restaurant atmosphere at home.
One of the popular menu items for bento boxes is "Freshly-Caught Fish and Shrimp Fries with Homemade Tartar Sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at the time.
Mr. Kiyoshi said, "We make the batter for the fried food as thin as possible so that you can taste the ingredients. With the shrimp fried, you can directly feel the crunchy texture."
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, a portion of Saga Prefecture-grown Hinohikari rice mixed with grains, and a soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the self-made field next to the house or from the direct sales office in the prefecture.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyoshi has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they have a mix of Japanese and Western flavors that both young and old can enjoy, such as the comforting taste of rolled omelette (Yumi-san).
The popular bento box "Hand-kneaded Hamburger with Domestic Mixed Meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
We will also be releasing a charcuterie set of processed meats to go with wine and other alcoholic beverages starting next year.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I decided to try it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's safe because it slows down and sometimes even stops completely when there are people around, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It hurts to be looked at by the people around me; it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it feels like they're in the way and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if there were some consideration, such as asking them to move to the side.
I think it would be best to create dedicated lanes and make sure they don't interfere with people walking around.
I thought it was a great vehicle because I could relax and take in the scenery while going at a slow pace, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
I felt a sense of excitement for the near future, where this kind of autonomous driving will become the norm, and the pain of the stares from my surroundings was strangely comforting. It was a difficult ride for those who are not very patient.
That was so embarrassing.

This is an eel bowl that looks really good, but you might not understand it unless you look closely - there's no eel used at all.
Actually, it's "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)!
I like eel, but I thought that everyone was just eating it with sauce, so as long as it wasn't overcooked, anything else didn't really matter. But then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually quite important.
I didn't want the eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
The recipe used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (with chili pepper instead of scallions).
I just fried the steamed one in a pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.
I am 20 years old.

One man was cut with a knife and escaped on a motorcycle in Saga City on the 12th; attempted murder incident in Ozai | Incident/Accident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka was slashed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.

A family's long journey to establish environmental protection activities at the Chinese border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
Kato Yuuki: Find Asia Corporate Consultant in Hong Kong China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the highest number of mammal species in the world and the third highest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities by the local government, but also support the activities of environmental activists.
Southwest China's Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna (also known as Sipsongpanna), is one of these regions.
My sister, Li Wenda, is currently active as an actress. The Sipsong Panna region is located in the border area between Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group which shares its roots with the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people (also known as the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture) covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Ms. Li Minhua in person at Xisha Pan Nal and hear about her environmental protection activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the catalyst for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianni" started in 2000.
The catalyst for that was my husband Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and has come to Seychelles for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China, boasting a wealth of biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish industry in this region and to produce rubber which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest took place previously.
The husband was sent here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And I got married to someone I knew here, who was a journalist like me.
Did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation before?
Li, I am from Cisterna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Because of this, I had to move forward with the project with my husband without any knowledge.
I sometimes see people who don't have particularly good looks or tall stature, but have an aura about them. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
The moment I gained confidence in myself, it naturally came out.
That person must have a strong inner confidence.

Is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say something like "That color looks nice"?
Isn't it too detailed?
I can see it.
I don't think it's very detailed.
I don't understand what you mean by "complimenting in detail" because I have never been told that before.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if Yoko Homma confessed their love to you?
I replied, "My heart is blooming with joy that you confessed to me. I would be honored to go out with you."
And, in order to date, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one at a later time?
It will be faster to set up at the same time.
It will be completed in about a week.
I recommend opening a NISA account so that you can use it right away when you want to, since there are no fees associated with it.

It took about one and a half months to identify the cause of CTD in the MOD self-circulating environment, which was causing it.
In March, due to not having much time to play, there were multiple CTDs caused by various factors, and it took a long time to identify them since we could only investigate a little bit at a time, mainly during holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have taken only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes don't leave a crash log.
Main Timing of CTD
All Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the logging type will not leave a trace in the logs.
When accumulating kills/attacks on some NPCs: Activating with console command "kill" can help, and turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE update re-release) can improve it. Is there a possibility of wet clothing in this case?
Turning off the PC-initiated kill move setting via .ini for some NPCs to improve the camera work when the kill move is triggered, with potential conflicts in the settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
While traveling in the field with some magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activated, when NPCs are hit: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application settings (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could this be caused by an additional armor or body mesh shader setting misconfiguration for an actor/NPC? Although the 2.0 SPID default.ini has a formatting mistake, it should result in the intended outcome and the NPC should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
At first, I focused heavily on checking body part attack and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dlls) by putting them through rigorous testing, and this is the result I got.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French language levels.
If there are any people in a Japanese environment who have the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful to post this as a reference in case it helps.
We are all barely managing mentally.
No one around me notices, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that even though that person looks very troubled, they are still working hard and energetically.
He is probably on the brink of a mental breakdown.
I haven't officially retired due to mental health reasons, but I think I was at my limit right before I retired.
What I think about the importance of psychiatric nursing visits - now that today's visit is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Today's home visit made me realize how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness, in addition to the necessary medication management (such as packaging).
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, or something like that, and we had a good laugh.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, and so on - is that something that's appropriate to discuss in home nursing visits?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from a friend that in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or a visiting nurse with a work therapist who is given orders from above with an attitude of "we are providing medical care here", etc.
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really great because they face me, who has a mental illness, on an equal and frank basis.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home visits and those who are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing can be very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, please take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nurse station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from my end because they just weren't working out.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one fifth of China's... "Delayed in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily News Japanese Version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, it was planned to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulatively) and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen per kilo was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen).
However, by November of this year, fuel cell vehicles will not exceed the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The target for the spread of core infrastructure hydrogen stations is 38% (about 117 places), and the price per kilo of hydrogen is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's performance of its Hydrogen Economy Roadmap is significantly below the target value.
The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keiren) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on the 12th.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core material of carbon fiber for fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), membrane by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that dominate the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
South Korea is ranked fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative from 2014 to 2020).
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations stated that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that the other competing countries are at a disadvantage."
The order of priority for national patents is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, South Korea registered 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to become the fourth largest, but it was still only 22% of China's 4,721 patents.
The All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large tax deduction for equipment investment and research and development expenses."
I had surgery to cut the tendons in my finger and it has been a month and a half.

It is important to sleep on a futon, and simply having a bank account, a debit card, or receiving government services requires an address.

Was the ratio of older sisters to wives during the Meiji and Showa eras much lower compared to now?
It seems like my sister had many wives.
The phrase "sister-in-law" has become so commonly used.
In those days, it was said that even if you had to wear a golden headscarf, you should look for a wife who was one year older than you. So I think there were more wives who were older than now during the Meiji and Showa eras.

The high prices of the PS5 are due to its rarity value, not because its value has increased from its original price.

The US has sent weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, and will also be involved in training troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
CNN reported that US State Department officials have reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden, has arrived in Ukraine by 12th.
Military aid totaling $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen) will be delivered to Ukraine, including the last equipment, such as howitzers, to be shipped after the New Year to identify the launch points of the four radars.
According to Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support from Russia to Ukraine is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as increasing forces around the Ukrainian border.
The US is increasing its vigilance towards Russian military movements, and is consulting with NATO member countries to develop a response plan in case Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House in September of this year.
The US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 25 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US Florida National Guard troops were deployed in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hand" gifts before death, directly hitting former LDP Tax Commission Chairman Masaharu Nakagawa!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
English: Pre-mortem gifting and rush inheritance technique.
Discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, and while it was not included in the 2022 tax reform outline which was a cause for concern, there is a high possibility that pre-death gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax countermeasures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
What changes will be made to the rules of inheritance?
I will impart everything from the basics of gift and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques, in order to make it in time for the advantageous last-minute gift giving, with a direct interview to the former Tax Commission Chairman and current House of Representatives Member, Kanemaru.
Diamond Editing Department, Kei-sho Miyahara
From wealthy individuals to city-based company employees, we should "forbid" the use of lifetime gifts and move towards a neutral tax system that takes into account both inheritance tax and gift tax when selecting the timing of asset transfer, and proceed with a full-scale examination.
There was a great disturbance among not only the wealthy but also the middle class when the party announced the outline of the 2021 tax reform last year.
Because what it is trying to say is that it will increase inheritance taxes by changing the rules of inheritance and making "gifts before death" - a common inheritance tax measure - a forbidden act.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the assets subject to taxation".
The pre-mortem gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
The discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" that emerged in such circumstances.
In the 22nd fiscal year tax reform outline announced on December 10th, which had been concerned about the fastest introduction, although it was not adopted, a more detailed wording was issued to indicate the policy towards unification, such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax, from the fact that it is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted) ... will continue to be reviewed".
Former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party and former Chairman of the Tax System Research Council, Atsushi Kanemaru, said in an interview with our editorial department.
It is most important to keep the tax burden the same regardless of when the transfer of assets takes place, so as not to lose any advantages or disadvantages due to the timing.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from integration, and if we make the fastest amendment, there are only three chances left for pre-mortem gifts.
It seems likely that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
What are the specific changes to the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television starting January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10th, 2022 on Fuji TV.
The movie is based on the same-named manga by Moriesato Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, and is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the burden of the past. Yamayana Hanjyun plays the heroine.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa and the heroine, Risae, is played by Yamayagi Kajun.
Rise, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kailei, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Rise's shoulder for some reason.
Rise is drawn to Kairi, who has similar features to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could Kairi be a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yudai Furukawa commented, "The drama 'My Righteous Older Brother' will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!"
We hope those who have not yet seen FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the work by seeing the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Risae, as well as their struggles and changes.
We are happy if even the fans of the original work can enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

The players of the team that won with only three passes in one NFL game - how did they feel and what did they experience? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets in the last 50 years of the NFL.
In 1974, the Bills had an unprecedented talent in RB O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with their running back duo of Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, with the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s and snowfall before the game.
The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
Passes were 30 times, while runs were 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not a failure.
There were four red zone penetrations in ten offensive series, and there was scoring potential.
In particular, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row in the late third quarter.
We only managed to get three points with one field goal in those three times.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty at 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
Allen, the quarterback, was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush on 3rd and 14 and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
He threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the endzone, but it was unsuccessful.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Digs was running a shallow cross and was open in the endzone, but it didn't seem to register with Allen.
Allen targeted wide receiver Gabriel Davis from the left side of the end zone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots' defensive back Miles Bryant and ended in failure.
Brian was man-to-man covering Bill's WR Call Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw two passes aiming for the end zone.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You should get a first down in two plays.
Allen's ability to run would have been showcased if they had gone for 4th and short, since it was still two minutes before the end.

It's time to replace three items that are often left in the kitchen for a long time, according to Harper's BAZAAR.
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it is likely that the sponge is not replaced as often as recommended.
Research from 2017 has found that even if kitchen sponges are microwaved daily to kill bacteria, they still tend to breed a lot of bacteria (although microwaving is still recommended).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when a cutting board begins to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, which is why bacteria can proliferate.
If it is still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and either air dry or lightly pat dry with a clean paper towel to remove excess water.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be painful to get rid of my favorite mug, but the chipped surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
It can also be the cause of chapped lips and spilled drinks.
That's right, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
The legendary general Guan Yu drowned in the river. Submitted by Builder of the Forbidden.

"Ussu Ussu"
"Let's practice so that we can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"Got it!"
"You never know when you might get killed by Cao Cao!"
The loyal general said something and then left.
Of course there's no way we're doing water attack, underwater bridge, three-quarter time drills! It's absolutely impossible unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and lock them in a cage and sink them!
Did you read the article at the link properly, even though I quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community markets and trade are two different things.
At the Community Market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for red transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been scammed out of items without any money being paid.
That won't happen.
Trade is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different conversation?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even for simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even for intellectual labor.
Help, my FlashBIOS won't finish!
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed on without blinking.
I tried to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS, thinking it might be corrupted, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it should take about 5 minutes to finish, but it might take up to an hour.
Possible causes could be an old USB memory stick or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have I overslept and missed the train?
Is there any other possible cause that could be similar?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I saw someone I know.
He always had a bag-of-bones kind of face.
I wasn't disliked or anything.

I feel embarrassed to have brand name items.
I can carry items that are not very noticeable, but I cannot carry items like Louis Vuitton with the monogram and the "LV" written on it.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it would be good if it were Japan.
In Japan, it is like this.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner rather than later, "Why am I the only one you're talking to in a rude/familiar way?"
If someone says "But doesn't that have nothing to do with them being a foreigner?", it's best to simply say that it's offensive.
I don't think I would even dream of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly decent probability.
I was living abroad for a while, and the Japanese people who went out there, including me, didn't like the Confucian etiquette. There were quite a few people who came, and I think the rules were relaxed. I think there were some misunderstandings where the locals thought we could say whatever we wanted.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's without any malice, more like a kind of spoiledness or a friendly attitude.
My friends from Europe and the US call each other by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, I sometimes get a bit confused about which one to use.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just that he's doing things normally and purely, but if you overlook it, he might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say something now.
Could you please speak according to Japanese rules since we are in Japan?
English: My white friend who is naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it has nothing to do with him.
Without a doubt, I'm conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if I do it that way, I won't be strangely looked down upon by people younger or older than me, and I can be treated like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of personality, pay attention to such small details (including me), so there are a lot of annoying people.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and saw that the new sub I created had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy!
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little bit longer to reach 50, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today so I'm really grateful.
It would be greatly appreciated if the people who subscribed to this sub-reddit today could tell us in the comments section where they heard about it! (I have no idea so I'm really curious!)
I would be grateful if everyone could start a thread since there is only one person starting a thread right now.
It would be encouraging if you could comment even if you don't start a thread.
I wonder if there are fewer people using Twitter than those using Reddit.
Please ask people who are using Twitter to start a thread!
Finally, thank you so much! The sub-group I created before didn't gather enough people and I gave up quickly, but this time, thanks to everyone, I think I can continue without giving up.

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text has a bit of a strange feel to it, but I understand what it's trying to say and I think it's at a level where it won't be a problem to play (I'm just saying this from my own opinion, so it might be a good idea to ask other people too).
It is common to see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, I feel that it is well translated.
Non-native Japanese speakers may find it difficult to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese, even after studying it for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people won't feel uncomfortable with, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

Could you please explain why it wouldn't make sense to move closer to my parents' house?
No matter where the location is, I think there are various reasons why someone would want to live alone, so it depends on the individual how they think about it.

In "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba," training is the battle.
"The Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human praise <In commemoration of the start of the anime "Yukaku Hen"> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
In recent shounen manga, one of the things that makes "Kimetsu no Yaiba" particularly unique is the abundance of training.
It is a common belief that training arcs, where there are no battles and the characters train day and night, are not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the two-year training period when the Straw Hat Pirates separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE" was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over, that it was not a major plot point.
Well, one-piece dresses have the appeal of being eccentric in a wandering land, but sometimes they don't go well with the idea of "staying in the same place for training".
The training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began when he kneeled before Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and Giyu said to him, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are only forced down by the powerful with their strength.
Despite saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness (despite his lack of communication skills) to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains prospective members of the Demon Slayer Corps.
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate a person?", to which Tanjiro was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied with a single punch, "You're too slow to decide."
Among the fans, it is an apparently unreasonable exchange of words.
Taking my sister, who has become a demon, for a walk carries the possibility that I may be forced to make a difficult decision at some point.
This could be called an initiation into practice from a mental attitude.
Rin Tazakura tells Giyu to take the inexperienced Tanjiro to the Mt. Hagiri and to make it down to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, pits, catapults, and traps, and it seems like one could die before even beginning their training.
Despite his sharp sense of smell, he barely manages to avoid the traps set by humans by detecting the faint smell of the trap, which is called the "Protagonist Correction".
Even so, it seems that the essence of Demon Slayer is making Tanjiro say "But I can't suddenly become so much more physically capable that I can avoid all of this!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is just being able to use the power and skills that have been honed up until then with their original potential.
Those who put in effort will be rewarded accordingly, while those who do not put in effort will not be rewarded. The "Law of Equivalent Exchange", which is a humanistic anthem that does not possess any supernatural power, is a difficult rule that is consistent throughout this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping without a bed, but instead laying a mattress directly on the floor of the house and using a futon and a quilt.
Because my house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Are you angry?
Are people who work part-time and juggle between two stores to work full-time difficult?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fit my idea of "strict," right?
I think of "gemetsui" as trying to devise a way to get more benefit than effort with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has established a new "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its CE and IM divisions into a single set division, the company announced on December 12th that it has decided to name the division DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its year-end organizational restructuring.
We can read the intention to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly established DX division is composed of business units such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network, which were integrated from its CE and IM divisions.
Samsung Electronics representatives explained that the name change reflects their long-term business structure, future-oriented vision, and strengthened global leadership.
In addition, the company emphasized its intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies on a company-wide scale, crossing organizational boundaries, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Is 1500BCE the same as before the Common Era?
English: What does that mean in Japanese?

BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE (Before Common Era) in recent years.
English: BCE stands for Before Common Era (BCE).

It's a good idea to try to get along with each other little by little.
Yes, this is Empire of the Undergrowth.
I remember it because I supported it on Kickstarter and I was working on translating it into Japanese.
I think that the "desu/masu style" would not be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice, although there may be a matter of preference.
I would like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible above the sand. Anything that stumbles into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The Hanmio larvae always lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey, only exposing their circular head from the sand.
This feels a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm curious about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Seeing from an ant's perspective?
I wonder, right?
Armored heads translated into a circular head would mean that the part about "a giant beast wearing a helmet in ant scale" would be lost.
Aichi 24-vehicle collision: Trailer driver had no pre-existing condition, was it carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
In the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, it has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution had no pre-existing illness and it appears that some kind of carelessness was the cause of the accident.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Katuya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing an initial collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer driven by the suspect Nomura continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
According to investigators, it has been determined that the suspect, Nomura, does not have any pre-existing conditions and that some kind of carelessness is likely to be the cause.
The police are searching the premises and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

"Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comic Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
This sequel focuses on one battle only, in contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals, and is packed with new gimmicks!
"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In one word, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and meticulously depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it is important to note that it is not just a volume that depicts the match in the ring.
The signing ceremony started off, and then we had a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes, which were quite different from what we had done before, so we couldn't get to the match yet, but it's not at all boring.
The tension of the story gradually increasing as the century-long war is about to begin surely connects to the rising tension of the readers, and it is truly amazing how this period was so precisely calculated for the production.
And before the important finals, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place match between Teriman and Ramenman.
As well as the luxuriousness of the match card, what I like is before the match, in the backstage, Ramenman shouting towards the Kinnikuman poster, "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!"
Trying to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, accepted the sword and prevented it, and after a silent stare, the scene ended with them parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
There is a lot of debate surrounding the character of Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now, that this is what it means!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight of the match was the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
Don't underestimate the power of fate for Kinnikuman!
That is a line of dialogue.
This could be seen as a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers have been feeling a bit that Kinnikuman has been winning somehow without relying on his strength, because he is the protagonist after all and can't lose.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei preemptively drove home the point that this hand was no longer usable.
With this one phrase, the reader is thinking, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin with his own strength?"
How do I do it?
This is like a line where the author has imposed a restriction on themselves, and it leads to an unpredictable development that stimulates our imagination.
Wow, you did an amazing thing!
I'm sure this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend to be held at Aoba Mountain in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Takahama-cho Nakayama's Aoba-yama Herbal Village, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
The winter illumination that started on November 26th consists of 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the promenade, lawn, and other areas, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture were surprised to find such a place when they came to Fukui after a long time.
She was saying that it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
The illumination was first planned to provide a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event with button pot serving and a movie screening.
I think there are only a few people who can read documents in order.
My friend who can read a lot told me that he was able to do it, but he was slowly solidifying the basics of Linux and rather than reading the documentation, he was reading from the table of contents of a reference book and reading the parts that interested him.
It is better to learn from Linux and other basics first, rather than jumping into something abstract like Docker, as it will be easier to understand and have more applications.
It's quite tough to expect to understand everything all at once by skipping over that.
It would be nice if you understand...
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the contents, just remember the parts you skimmed over and read them when necessary.
I started off by just jumping into practice without reading anything, and kept repeating that until I gradually started to read.

The Yamagata Shimbun is broadcasting from Zoshiki, Yamagata Prefecture, on the internet, promoting agricultural and livestock products from the Riceza Agricultural Promotion Association.
The Okishima Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JAs in the Okishima area, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce", which distributes videos over the internet while selling products, on the 11th.
Tokyo's Minato Market TV, the first project planned by the Minato Ward, featured the Yamagata Aisen Bujotai remotely, delivering the appeal of the region along with its specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project", a collaboration between the Oki-tama area and the Port District, has been decided to have a store, and it was broadcasted from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Haranew-machi, Yonezawa City.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of my NAS PC has gone out! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened?
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
After doing a few things, I noticed a sound coming from my PC like a pink rotor, so I quickly shut it down.
At this point, I thought that the fan's movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
Not starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power light will briefly turn on and the fan will start to move, but it will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Unplug the power plug and try again, but it still only lights up for a moment.
I tried connecting only the motherboard and the ATX20 pin and 4 pin, but it still wouldn't boot even after removing all other parts.
I have heard a buzzing sound before, as if something is hitting the PSU, so I am suspicious that the PSU might be the cause.
I will try to find an ATX power supply that is left over from the other day and test it.
Probably.
What should I do if it doesn't work out?
Should I change the case and the motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits in the last 4-5 years?

I want them to stay true to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
Computer Farm
I have brought it in once, but they won't pick it up for free from Saitama Prefecture even though it is located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture.
If it is relatively new, it is free.
Inverse Net
I haven't used it before, but I heard that Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear what people think about it.
Large garbage (fee-based) and additional items > Collection boxes provided by the local government (small appliances and electronics for free).
Sell it in the middle ages.
Addendum: Mercari and Hard Off
Is there anyone who sells things at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it is still worth money.
Addendum > Information provided by RINET Japan: /u/CheetahPresent8059
I have a broken printer that no one will take, and an old UPS that is becoming a nuisance.
It's not a large item, so it probably won't cost any money, but it seems to be postponed for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated abroad have no value.
In Japan, bills can be exchanged, but coins cannot be exchanged.
Commemorative coins contain gold, so they have value.
Is it possible to dislike someone even though they haven't done anything wrong?
Yes, it is natural to have likes and dislikes since we are human.
"Hating something (for no reason) - that's what it means to be a hater."

She can't do it, but is she being discriminated against because of her face?
It's not about the face, it's about the heart.
It's sad that people are judged by their appearance.
The inner self cannot be seen.
What did you do with your school sports uniform after graduation?
I usually wear it as casual wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before they started living together, they were roommates and laughed.
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?

If you are healthy.
The men's volleyball team has advanced to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / The men's fencing team's Frael finished in 4th place and did not win a medal.
The Japanese men's volleyball team, "Dragon God Japan," advances to the finals of the World Cup for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakaguchi: "It was a big goal."
When I got taken in the third set with a double referee challenge, I thought it was all over, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
It seems like our opponent in the semi-finals was in a different league, so why is that opponent in the third-place decider?
I would like to plant trees in the yard that will provide privacy, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, I would like something that is easy to maintain, evergreen, and preferably produces fruit.
Please be kind to me.
To get fruit on a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby so that it will bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to have between us in order to live together comfortably?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It is better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to have a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, attend various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to cohabitation.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-release legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there a game that uses cards like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
I think it's a ant.
