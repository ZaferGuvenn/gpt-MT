The reason I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has stated the reasons for his departure from the PDP and his return to the APC.
If former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, defected from the PDP to the APC this week.
Dogara said that he should stay and enjoy the support of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State to help the masses win in the 2019 election, but he should gather and leave the party to go back to the APC.
The main reason I left Bauchi is because of the PDP's rule in the state.
I participated in the gubernatorial election in which former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed defeated incumbent Governor Mohammed Abubakar.
I am currently working on a project for the Bala government.
I will continue to stay in the PDP, they have given me what they can, I will not give them a chance, I will go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a resignation letter from the PDP which he sent to the male leader of the party, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said that, just as he had reminded the other governors where they had failed to fix things in the past, Bala was not exempt.
Let them go on the trip.

APC Accuses Governor Neja of Attempting to Introduce Tribalism into the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) issued a statement yesterday accusing the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to introduce factionalism within the party.
The Chairman and Secretary of the Engineering Association, Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Muhammad Liman, have signed to declare that, in the six years the Association has been in power in the state, only 512 million Naira has been received.
The Governor's statement continued, that the meeting he called for the stakeholders, which was held last Monday, will help to bring unity to the party, where they said they have written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing issues in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the factions of the party by organizing a roundtable discussion, which is not based on any rules, so that any complaints against the party leaders should be written to the party secretary for investigation."
So far, in the six years since the party was founded, 512 million naira has been in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor's role was to be part of the national reconciliation committee established on July 25, 2020, which was led by the President to guide the resolution of disputes between the parties and to resolve the court cases between the parties.
We have used the funds we received to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries and to carry out other activities related to the party, such as organizing elections, resolving disputes, and providing health care due to lack of access to government aid, without spending any party funds in an unauthorized manner. We challenge anyone to provide evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I previously stated, the local government elections that took place in the state are the most important elections that have taken place in the country, which we conducted with both former and current officials in charge of power in all twenty-five local governments in the state, with the funds spent on the elections being distributed to the officials to bring about their respective constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent without any rules, as this is an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name to the party in order to discredit it. He also said that there is no committee set up to investigate how the party funds are being spent and who set it up.
The complainant claimed that the money he was accusing of being misappropriated was money given by the national party treasurer, not any other money, so I challenge anyone to bring evidence to support his accusation in any way.
The Imam said that we should stand firmly in support of the APC party against any individual or group attempting to undermine the party, and he added that any allegations against the party or any of its leaders from the state level should be referred to the disciplinary committee as stated in Article 21 (B) (d) of Section 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, members of the party have no influence particularly if they attempt to take control of the committee, so their verdict has no effect.
Because of this reason, they are the approved leaders of the party in the state, as stated in Article 21 and Section 6 of Chapter 87 of the party's constitution, any violation of this will not be accepted.
Because of the court's ruling, the leaders have made a mistake.
Yesterday, those who presented and accepted at the unproductive meeting, including Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The committee appointed by the party leader, Engineer Mohammed Imam, will be the only one to lead it, not the governor will lead the party's state leaders.
The statement further stated that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello reminded of the promise made to the people of the state during the election, to travel with the party's parents in the government so that everyone will benefit from the state and all factions through the provision of political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The members of the National Assembly who attended the meeting and brought attention to the need for reconciliation on all issues between the party members should not be surprised that their colleagues who are aware of their own faults refused to accept deception as a party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the committee chairman to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate position in order to attempt to reduce the politics of the state.
Nigeria is at the forefront of Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, has stated that the country is ready to take advantage of the digital economy.

Eating healthy food is essential for the health of people in Nigeria.
Scientists have warned people to avoid eating food that has been treated with preservatives, saying that consuming such food can be detrimental to one's health.
Masanan issued this warning after conducting an investigation into the quality of food consumed in this country.
The study showed that there are some foods that are fortified with minerals to prevent them from spoiling.
The study also showed that this ingredient was used in dishes such as alabo, busasshhen fish, and other fish dishes sold to the public.
Anna is using the language so that when someone sees it they will be interested in using it.
This food containing this preservative has caused diseases such as diarrhea, fever, heartburn, and more.
Call on people in this country to be cautious when consuming these kinds of food for their health.
Grace Olasumbo, a food nutritionist, has called on Nigerians to avoid eating fruits ripened with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used by traders to ignite combustible materials, such as marble.
Research shows that patience and perseverance are among the things that make traders use this resource to show commodities in just one day.
Olasumbo stated that something that traders have failed to recognize is the use of this technology to demonstrate the potential harm of certain gemstones to human health.
The symptoms of illnesses such as fever, sore eyes, stomachache, headache, cough, sore throat, and other similar ailments are evidence of this.
The African Heads of State of Central Banks have been exonerated from blame - Freedom Radio Nigeria.

The United States is demanding that an investigation be conducted into Mr. Adesina following allegations made against him by the African Development Bank's governing board, prompting the formation of a committee of experts to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.

We Celebrate Our Leaders With Food and Drinks - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the soul of all living beings, one cannot live without food.
This is the reason why the Chinese government is becoming more stringent in ensuring the welfare of the people of the country and food security.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in the field of food security, giving the world a surprise given the large population of the country, estimated to be 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has helped greatly with the matter of China providing major contributions to global hunger relief, as the Director of the State Administration of Grain of China, Zhang Wufeng, has previously stated, since 1949 to the present, China has always placed the issue of hunger relief at the forefront of all its national affairs.
Last week, people and media outlets from around the world once again expressed "concern" about whether China could effectively contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to its own population and the rest of the world.
We thank you all very much for always taking care of the Chinese presence in this world.
The Chinese Communist Party has achieved success in providing sufficient food for the people through its efforts.
Eating breakfast is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party every day.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the National Committee of the JKS, Chinese President Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that any food waste is a result of hard work.
Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruption to the world this year, China is still able to provide its citizens with sufficient food supply.
The Chinese government's announcement regarding the country's grain output, particularly rice, for 2020 shows that the amount of rice harvested in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2019.
He Ma Ke Bingsheng, the former president of the University of Agriculture in China, said that China has achieved great successes in terms of economic development and food security compared to the early stages of its reform and opening up policy.
Huang Jikun, the director of the Agricultural Development Research Center of China at Peking University, told a representative of "The China Science Daily" in an interview that the biggest challenge China is facing in the next two to three years is whether it can reduce the amount of grain and cotton stored in warehouses.
Now, the average person in the world has access to 474 kilograms of food per year instead of the 400 kilograms they should have access to.
China is now introducing millions of tons of agricultural products to replenish domestic livestock reserves only.
Therefore, those who are concerned about this issue should take a deep breath, go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Sinawa are able to sustain themselves with the food they provide for themselves.
I am calling for Governor Ganduje to be taken to court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The candidate of the PDP party, Abba Kabir Yusuf, has stated his reasons for prosecuting the Governor of Kano, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, and some businessmen in front of the High Court.
Abba Kabir declared this through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who said he filed the case against the alleged appropriation of some government properties and public benefits by some traders in Kano State.
Abba Kabir Yusuf has also sued the Kano State Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport, the Kano State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, and the Kano State Land and Property Management Authority.

Abi can sing beautifully, and she plans to release her debut album in 2023.
Dan Uwa, the Chief Aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has stated that the rotation of power in Nigeria has become a thing of the past.
Mamman Daura said that Nigeria has already done enough groundwork and should now focus on selecting the most suitable candidate for 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he revealed this.
This system of electing a president in Nigeria has not yielded any visible results since it was first implemented in 1999.
Daura said to pay attention to who is deserving when selecting someone, not to follow the system of favoritism.
The Igbo people, also known as Inyamirai, have sent a delegation to Daura in response to this call.
President Buhari and his Vice President have jointly maintained their grip on power through successive elections, and now he has come out to suggest that this should not be the case in 2023.
Buhari was not the only Nigerian chosen, he was elected.
The veteran guards of the country who have been sitting in their chairs for many years have not been removed, and they are better at their job than the others.
I will wait for you.
On Tuesday, Nigeria's political leadership was criticized by the Igbo Zalla Preservation Group, Ndigbo, for the derogatory statement made by the Nigerian leadership against the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, the brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, he stated that a zoning system will be used in the 2023 presidential election.
The Igbo have taken to social media to send a message to President Muhammadu Buhari, calling for an end to ethnic discrimination.
On Wednesday, the Igbo ethnic group in the South-East region of Nigeria issued a statement that they will allow the President of Nigeria to be elected from the South-East region in the 2023 election, that is, from the Igbo ethnic group.
The Spokesperson of the Igbo Ethnic Group, Emeka Attamah, has stated that Mamman Daura's statement about leading Nigeria in 2023 is a source of pride for the Igbo people.
In Banda Hadama, I have been preventing Mamman Daura from making any statements since 2019.
Jonathan has stepped down and now Daura is leading the Northern region in the 2023 Nigerian election campaign.
He will leave the legacy of what he has achieved from his predecessor, the current head of state, and then come up with an unknown issue of contention in 2023.
He accepted the role of judge and embraced truth, holding it in high regard.
The election of the country's president in 2023 will come with a promise of freedom and respect for all citizens.

The Arewa Media Writers are uniting the North.
Modern communication platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, and others have long been playing a major role in providing avenues for conversations, connections, and unity among different communities around the world, as well as sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational, and commercial agendas.
Nigerian youths have embraced this new technology of using social media platforms to stay up to date, to give back to their communities, and to engage in conversations that affect their lives.
We can say that these developments have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economy, education, and politics in the region.
Some people are eating food by typing and sending messages online, they have found jobs or have expanded the jobs they are doing.
Unfortunately, instead of using this opportunity to achieve progress, some people have chosen to exploit vulnerable children in the southern part of this country, fleeing abroad to escape public persecution, within and outside the country, or to engage in slanderous writing and insulting government officials and dignitaries.
What shows lack of progress, is holding back the progress of the youth of this country.
The establishment of the Arewa Media Writers in Nigeria is a great blessing, providing Northern youth with a good platform and a safe environment to express themselves on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful content and promote the goals of the Arewa people.
It is necessary for us to support this organization with what it needs in order to achieve its noble objectives, which will bring benefits not only to our region of the North, but to Nigeria as a whole.
We invite all of our citizens, especially those using social media, to join us in protecting the North and its rights, and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.
Our Northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their successors have strived to provide for the people of the North.
The late Malam Aminu Kano famously said, "Nigeria is one, but everyone knows their own house!" in his fight against injustice and oppression.
We reiterate our call for the advancement of the nation and the improvement of the governance system, at every level, to join hands with the people of the North without any religious or tribal discrimination, to bring progress to our region.
If we consider how the North used to be compared to how it is now.
We should make use of the wisdom that God has given us to provide the North with a sustainable path to economic prosperity through volunteering and advice.
Northern Nigeria should create revenue sources to fund its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide money.
In order for us to progress in the North, we must prioritize education, agriculture, tourism, health, science, and technology.
We can give help in many different ways, even if we don't have much money.
With this in mind, the North will fulfill our wishes!
We are proud of the North.

This lack of resources has caused the sector to be plagued with financial problems, resulting in its reliance on foreign aid.
Umar said that despite the aid they were receiving, there was no visible effort from the government in the health sector, which led them to start withdrawing the aid they were giving.
Nigeria has repatriated 53,000 people who were stranded in Nigeria.

We can say that this is why we are in a difficult situation in the country, because the rulers, governors, and president have no idea how to move the country forward.
We must say that, until that barrier is broken and a new one appears, it is our duty to reform ourselves so that God may bring us a solution to the issue of rape.
We must remember that, even if it is done for safety, everything should be left to God because He is the one who relieves all distress and poverty for the people.
No matter what situation you are in, Allah is aware of you and whatever you do, so always be mindful and humble, and always remember that you will die and always remember that you will be held accountable for your actions. If you are held accountable for what you have done, then repent.

Black is King is a musical film featuring songs by the renowned American singer and songwriter Beyonce, who leads the production, direction, and completion of the film.

Doing difficult tasks with great impact strengthens character.

Try Hard and Persevere in Pursuing Your Goals, It Is in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan Village is a Hui ethnic minority village located in Hongsipu, Wuzhong City, Ningxia Province in northern China.
There is a famous woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Muslim name) who is renowned for her struggles in life and the success she achieved in her efforts to escape poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort, perseverance, and seeking are all within our hearts.
First of all, her name was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, but she never went to school with the intention of getting an education, which is why she couldn't read or write.
May God grant her wisdom and insight, and great wisdom, so that she may be an example in the fight against poverty.
Twenty years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from a uterine tumor, which resulted in her undergoing three surgeries.
After her accident, she encountered a terrible misfortune, and now she is traveling with a cast on her leg.
These challenges she faced have put her in a difficult situation, even concerning the issue of medication, which is why she had to take on a debt of around 3 million Yuan, equivalent to about 16 million Naira.
It is amazing that this challenge that Mrs. Sadiya faced has opened up a path of discovery and growth for her to improve her life.
The financial support provided by the Chinese government has given her more confidence.
You can make different kinds of crafts using yarn.
Because of her hard work, her business has grown significantly, with different employees giving her support.
She created many machines that helped her automate her work.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to connect one main cable, but now in this time, it can connect up to 5 cables.
She also made some additional adjustments to the settings to make the output more accurate.
There is an additional engine that can quickly prepare food for animals, and now it is selling these engines to those who are looking for them.
By taking on the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and her continued efforts to improve her own life and that of her employees, it is clear that she is determined to succeed.
Fighting poverty and improving quality of life is not something that can be left up to the government alone.
If the government provides support, but people do not have the resources or motivation to improve their lives by taking initiative based on their current situation, then progress will only be made without achieving any goal.
The labyrinth shows that running a business or undertaking to make money does not require large amounts of money or trips to other cities or countries.
She considered her situation and made use of the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Despite the difficulties, teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks without relying on her husband, since he had left her.
Perseverance and effort, with a determination to reach one's goal, is something that comes from within.
This demonstrates the strength that women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone else.
This lesson shows that whatever one does, one should stand by their convictions, for relying on someone else is not certain.
Indeed, Sadiya was a diligent, hardworking and disciplined woman who became an example and a lesson to others.
Today, by the end of March, Mrs. Sadiya has completed paying all the debts she was owing, and has stopped receiving government aid on her own accord.
Faeza Mustafa.
There is a push in American politics to redouble efforts to contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Yesterday, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the measures taken by some countries to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be available soon. He stated that it is necessary to avoid showing favoritism to certain countries while distributing the vaccine.
The distribution of resources should be done in a fair way around the world, as this would be in line with the major objectives of different countries.
Some American politicians are pursuing a strategy of demonstrating their own power, regarding the distribution of vaccine resources, and they are undermining the international cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has surpassed 23 million.
In total, there are people who have lost their lives due to the virus with over 800 fatalities.
In this severe situation, attention is being paid to the effects of the vaccine against the virus, and the good news is that, in recent days, there has been a great breakthrough in the study of the vaccine in some countries, giving hope and faith to the entire world population.
Some American politicians have shown a desire to seize all the oil reserves.
According to the magazine "Science", the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase more than six billion dollars worth of COVID-19 vaccines from various pharmaceutical companies.
The US government understands its purpose as a leader in the fight against the virus, but other developing countries also need adequate resources, given their lack of access to healthcare.
The magazine "The Ecologist" has stated that if the US achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the amount of emissions available to developing countries will decrease.
The Director of the African CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, expressed his concern about this issue when he visited the center.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of overcoming the virus unless there is a plan for distributing the vaccine, which is a major challenge for countries around the world.
The world's countries should strengthen their cooperation with each other.
WHO Director-General Tedros has shown that in order to see the end of the pandemic, it must be tackled from all angles around the world, not just allowing some parts of the world or a few countries to reach the goal of overcoming the effects of the virus alone.
